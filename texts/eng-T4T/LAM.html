<p>The sorrows of the people of Jerusalem</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Jerusalem was once full of people,</p><p>but now it is deserted.</p><p>
    Once it was honored by people all over the world,</p><p>but now it is grieving/abandoned like [SIM] a widow.</p><p>
    Once it was honored like [MET] a princess is honored among the nations,</p><p>but now we who live here have become slaves.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>We [PRS] weep bitterly all night long,</p><p>with tears flowing down our cheeks.</p><p>Among the people in all the nations that loved Jerusalem</p><p>there are none that comfort us now.</p><p>All the rulers of those nations that were previously our allies have betrayed us,</p><p>and they are all now enemies of the people of Jerusalem.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    The people of Judah have been ◄exiled/forced to go to other countries►</p><p>and caused to suffer greatly as slaves.</p><p>They live in other nations</p><p>where they do not have peace/safety.</p><p>Their enemies seized them,</p><p>and there was no way for them to escape.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>The roads to Zion Hill are empty [PRS]</p><p>because no one comes here to celebrate the sacred festivals.</p><p>The city gates are deserted,</p><p>and the priests groan.</p><p>The young women of Jerusalem cry</p><p>
    because they are suffering greatly.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Our enemies have conquered the city,</p><p>and now they prosper.</p><p>Yahweh has punished the people of Jerusalem</p><p>because of all the sins that they have committed.</p><p>The children of Jerusalem have been captured</p><p>and taken to other countries.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Jerusalem was a beautiful city,</p><p>but it is not beautiful now.</p><p>The leaders of the city are like [SIM] deer that are starving</p><p>because of being unable to find any grass to eat.</p><p>They are very weak,</p><p>with the result that they are unable to run from their enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    The people of Jerusalem are sad and scattered,</p><p>and they think about the previous greatness of the city.</p><p>
    But now our enemies have captured the city,</p><p>and there is no one to help the people.</p><p>Our enemies destroyed the city</p><p>and laughed while they were doing that.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    The people of [PRS] Jerusalem have sinned very much;</p><p>
    it is as though [MET] the city has become like a filthy rag.</p><p>All those who previously honored the city now despise it,</p><p>because they see that it has become very disgraced [MET].</p><p>Now the people of the city groan,</p><p>and they cover their faces because they are very ashamed.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>The city has become filthy because of [PRS] the sins that the people have committed;</p><p>they did not think about what could happen to the city.</p><p>
    Now the city has been destroyed,</p><p>and there is no one to comfort the people.</p><p>
    The people cry out saying, “Yahweh, look at how we are suffering</p><p>because our enemies have defeated us!”</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Our enemies have taken away all our treasures,</p><p>all the valuable things that we owned.</p><p>We have seen soldiers from other nations, men who do not worship Yahweh, enter our sacred temple,</p><p>
    the place where foreigners/non-Israelis were ◄forbidden/not allowed► to enter.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>The people of the city groan</p><p>while they search for food;</p><p>they have given their treasures</p><p>to get food to eat to remain alive.</p><p>
    They say, “Yahweh, look at us,</p><p>and see that we are despised!”</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>You people who pass by,</p><p>you do not [RHQ] seem to care at all about what has happened to us.</p><p>Look around and see</p><p>that there are no other [RHQ] people who are suffering like we are.</p><p>Yahweh has caused us to suffer</p><p>because he was extremely angry with us.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    It is as though he sent a fire from heaven [MTY]</p><p>that burned in our bones;</p><p>
    it is as though [MET] he has placed a trap for our feet,</p><p>and has prevented us from walking any further.</p><p>He has abandoned us;</p><p>we are weak/miserable every day, all day long.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>He caused the sins that we have committed to be like a heavy load for us to carry;</p><p>
    it is as though [MET] he tied them around our necks.</p><p>Previously we were strong,</p><p>but he has caused us to become weak.</p><p>He has allowed our enemies to capture us,</p><p>and we were not able to do anything to resist them.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>Yahweh looked at our mighty soldiers</p><p>and laughed at them.</p><p>He has summoned a great army</p><p>to come and crush our young soldiers.</p><p>
    It is as though [MET] Yahweh has trampled on us people of Judah</p><p>like [SIM] people trample on grapes in a pit to make wine.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>I weep because of all those things;</p><p>my eyes are filled with tears.</p><p>There is no one to comfort me;</p><p>those who could encourage me are far away.</p><p>Our enemies have conquered us,</p><p>so our children have nothing good to ◄hope for/expect to happen►.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    We people of [PRS] Jerusalem reach out our hands to get help,</p><p>but there is no one to comfort us.</p><p>Yahweh has decided concerning us descendants of Jacob</p><p>that the people in nearby nations will become our enemies;</p><p>so they consider that</p><p>Jerusalem has become like [MET] a filthy rag.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>But what Yahweh has done to us is fair,</p><p>because we have rebelled against obeying the commands that he gave us.</p><p>You people everywhere, listen to us;</p><p>
    look and see that we are suffering greatly.</p><p>We had many sons and daughters,</p><p>but they have been captured and forced to go to distant countries.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>We pleaded with our allies to help us,</p><p>but they all refused.</p><p>Our priests and our leaders</p><p>have died from hunger in the city</p><p>while they were searching for food</p><p>
    to eat to remain alive.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>Yahweh, see that we are suffering very much.</p><p>
    It is as though our inner beings are tormented.</p><p>We are sad [SYN]</p><p>because we have rebelled against you.</p><p>Our enemies kill people in the streets with their swords;</p><p>people are dying because they have no food to eat.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>People have heard us while we groaned,</p><p>but no one came to comfort us.</p><p>
    Yahweh, you caused us to experience this disaster,</p><p>and our enemies are happy to see what you have done to us.</p><p>But cause it soon to be the time that you have promised,</p><p>when our enemies will suffer like we have suffered!</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    Yahweh, see all the evil things that they have done</p><p>and punish them!</p><p>
    Punish them like you have punished us</p><p>for all the sins that we committed!</p><p>
    We say this to you because we suffer and groan very much,</p><p>and we ◄faint/are very sad►.</p><a href="#LAMENTATIONS-c-2"><h3 id="LAMENTATIONS-c-2">2</h3></a>
<p>Yahweh punished Jerusalem</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh was extremely angry with us;</p><p>as a result, it was as though [MET] he covered Jerusalem with a dark cloud.</p><p>Previously it was a beautiful/glorious city,</p><p>but he has caused it to become a ruins.</p><p>At the time he punished [MET] Israel,</p><p>he even abandoned his temple [MET] in Jerusalem.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Yahweh destroyed the homes of the people of [PRS] Judah;</p><p>he did not act mercifully.</p><p>Because he was very angry,</p><p>he broke down the fortresses of Judah.</p><p>He has caused our kingdom and our rulers to become disgraced,</p><p>and he has gotten rid of them.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Because he was extremely angry,</p><p>he has caused Israel to not be powerful [MET] any more.</p><p>He has refused to assist us</p><p>when our enemies attacked us.</p><p>He has destroyed Israel</p><p>like [SIM] a raging fire destroys everything.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>He bent his bow to prepare to shoot us, his people,</p><p>as though we were his enemies.</p><p>He prepared to kill the people whom we love the most [MET],</p><p>members of our own families.</p><p>He is extremely angry [MTY] with us people of Jerusalem;</p><p>his anger is like [SIM] a fire.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Yahweh has become like an enemy</p><p>to us Israelis;</p><p>he has destroyed our palaces</p><p>and caused our fortresses to become ruins.</p><p>He has gotten rid of many people in Jerusalem,</p><p>and caused us to mourn and weep for those who were killed.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>He has caused his temple to be smashed</p><p>
    as easily as [SIM] if it was a shelter in a garden.</p><p>He has caused us, his people, to forget</p><p>all our sacred festivals and Sabbath days.</p><p>He has caused our kings and priests to be rejected</p><p>because he was extremely angry with them.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Yahweh has rejected his own altar</p><p>and abandoned his temple.</p><p>He has allowed our enemies to tear down the walls</p><p>of our temple and our palaces.</p><p>They shout victoriously in the temple of Yahweh,</p><p>like we previously shouted during our sacred festivals.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Yahweh was determined</p><p>to cause the walls of our city [MTY] to be torn down.</p><p>
    It was as though he measured the walls</p><p>and then he completely destroyed [MTY] them.</p><p>
    It was as though he caused the towers and walls to lament/weep,</p><p>
    because they were now ruins.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>The city gates have collapsed;</p><p>the bars that fastened the gates shut have been smashed.</p><p>The king and his officials have been forced to go to other countries.</p><p>No longer does anyone teach the people the laws that God gave to Moses.</p><p>The prophets do not receive any visions</p><p>
    because Yahweh does not give them any.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>The old men of Jerusalem [MTY] sit on the ground,</p><p>and they say nothing.</p><p>They wear rough sackcloth</p><p>and throw dust on their heads to show that they are sad.</p><p>The young girls of Jerusalem bow down sorrowfully,</p><p>their faces touching the ground.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>My eyes are very tired because of my tears;</p><p>I am very grieved in my soul.</p><p>Because very many of my people have been killed,</p><p>I grieve and am exhausted.</p><p>
    Even children and babies are fainting</p><p>
    and dying in the streets because they have no food.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>They cry out to their mothers,</p><p>“We need [RHQ] something to eat and drink!”</p><p>They faint like wounded men</p><p>in the streets of the city.</p><p>They slowly die</p><p>in the arms of their mothers.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>You people of Jerusalem [MTY, DOU],</p><p>◄what can I/there is nothing that I can► say to help you.</p><p>No people have [RHQ] suffered like you are suffering;</p><p>I do not know what I can do to comfort you.</p><p>The disaster [MET] that you have experienced is as great</p><p>as the ocean is deep;</p><p>there is no one [RHQ] who can restore your city.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>The prophets among you claimed that they had seen visions from Yahweh,</p><p>but what they said was false and worthless.</p><p>They did not save you from being ◄exiled/forced to go to other countries►,</p><p>because they did not proclaim that you had sinned.</p><p>Instead, the messages that they gave you deceived you</p><p>
    because they were not true.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>All those who pass by you</p><p>make fun of [IDM] you;</p><p>they shake their heads</p><p>and they hiss/sneer at you.</p><p>
    They say, “Is this that great city of Jerusalem?</p><p>Is it the city that was the most beautiful city in the world,</p><p>the city that caused all the people on the earth to be joyful?”</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    Now all our enemies scoff [IDM] at you;</p><p>they hiss/sneer at you and gnash their teeth to show that they hate you.</p><p>They say, “We have destroyed them!</p><p>This is what we longed/waited for,</p><p>and now it has happened!”</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Yahweh has done what he planned;</p><p>long ago he threatened to destroy you,</p><p>and now he has done it.</p><p>He has destroyed your city without acting mercifully toward you;</p><p>he has enabled your enemies to he happy about defeating you;</p><p>he has enabled your enemies to continually become stronger.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>I wish/desire that the walls of Jerusalem [APO]</p><p>would cry out to Yahweh!</p><p>You people of Jerusalem [MET],</p><p>Cry day and night!</p><p>Let your tears flow like rivers.</p><p>Do not stop grieving;</p><p>do not stop crying.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Get up every night and cry out;</p><p>tell Yahweh what you are feeling.</p><p>Raise your arms to plead to him</p><p>to act mercifully to prevent our children from dying;</p><p>they are fainting on the street corners</p><p>because they have no food to eat.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>Yahweh, look, and think about it!</p><p>Have you ever [RHQ] caused people to suffer like this before?</p><p>
    It is certainly not right that [RHQ] women are eating the flesh of their own children,</p><p>the children whom they have always taken care of!</p><p>
    It is not right that [RHQ] priests and prophets are being killed</p><p>in your own temple!</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    The corpses of people of all ages lie in the streets;</p><p>
    there are even corpses of young men and young women who have been killed by our enemies’ swords.</p><p>Because you were very angry,</p><p>you caused them to be killed;</p><p>you have slaughtered them</p><p>without pitying them at all.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>You summoned our enemies to attack us from every direction,</p><p>as though you were calling/inviting them to come to a feast.</p><p>At that time when you showed that you were very angry,</p><p>no one escaped.</p><p>Our enemies murdered our little children,</p><p>ones whom we took care of and reared/brought up.</p><a href="#LAMENTATIONS-c-3"><h3 id="LAMENTATIONS-c-3">3</h3></a>
<p>Hope in the midst of distress</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>I , the one who am writing this, am a man who has been afflicted/punished [MTY] by Yahweh</p><p>because he was angry.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    It was as though he caused me to walk in a very dark place</p><p>without any light at all.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>He has punished [IDM] me many times,</p><p>all day, every day.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>He has caused my skin and my flesh to become old.</p><p>He has broken my bones.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>He has surrounded me [DOU]</p><p>with bitterness and suffering.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    It is as though he has buried me in a dark place</p><p>like [SIM] the graves of those who have been dead for a long time.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    It is as though [MET] he has built a wall around me,</p><p>and fastened/tied me with heavy chains,</p><p>and I cannot escape.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Although I call out and cry out for him to help me,</p><p>he does not pay attention to my prayers.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    It is as though he has blocked my path with a high stone wall</p><p>and has caused my path to become crooked.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>He has waited to attack me</p><p>like [SIM] a bear or a lion hides and waits to attack other animals.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    It is as though he has dragged me off the path and ◄mauled me/torn me into pieces►,</p><p>and left me without help.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    It is as though [MET] he bent his bow and caused me to become the target</p><p>
    at which he shot his arrows.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    It is as though he shot his arrows deep into my body.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>All my relatives laugh at me;</p><p>all day, every day they sing songs that make fun of me.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>He has filled me with ◄bitterness/great suffering►,</p><p>
    like [MET] someone who drinks a very bitter liquid suffers.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    It is as though he has caused me to chew gravel that broke my teeth,</p><p>and he has trampled me in the dirt.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Things no longer go well for me;</p><p>I no longer remember being prosperous.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>I continued to say to myself, “I no longer expect to live much longer;</p><p>I no longer confidently expect to receive good things from Yahweh!”</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>When I think about my suffering and my wandering away from home,</p><p>
    it is like drinking a very bitter [DOU] liquid.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>I will never forget this time</p><p>when I feel very depressed/discouraged [IDM].</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>However, I confidently expect Yahweh to do good things for me again</p><p>when I think about this:</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>Yahweh never stops faithfully loving us,</p><p>and he never stops being kind to us.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    He is the one whom we can always trust/lean on.</p><p>Every morning he is merciful to us again.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    So I say to myself, “Yahweh is all that I need;</p><p>so I will confidently wait for him to do good things for me.”</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>Yahweh is good to all those who depend on him,</p><p>to those who seek his help.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    So it is good for us to wait quietly</p><p>for Yahweh to save/rescue us.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>And it is good for us to patiently endure suffering</p><p>while we are young.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>Those who seek his help should sit by themselves, silently,</p><p>
    knowing that it is Yahweh who has allowed/caused them to suffer.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>They should lie in the dirt, with their faces on the ground,</p><p>
    because they can still hope that Yahweh will help them.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>If someone strikes us on one cheek,</p><p>we should turn the other cheek toward that person in order that he may strike it, too,</p><p>and accept/endure it when we are insulted.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>Yahweh does not abandon us his people forever.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>Sometimes he causes us to suffer,</p><p>but sometimes he is kind to us</p><p>because he continually and faithfully loves us.</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>And he is not happy about causing human beings to suffer</p><p>or to be sad.</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>If people ◄mistreat all the prisoners/crush all the prisoners under their feet►</p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>or if they rebel against God</p><p>by refusing to give to people the things that it is right for them to receive,</p><p>
    <sup>36</sup>or if they cause judges to decide matters unjustly,</p><p>◄does Yahweh not see all those things?/Yahweh certainly sees all those things!► [RHQ]</p><p>
    <sup>37</sup>No one can [RHQ] command something to happen and then cause it to happen</p><p>if Yahweh has not already decided that it should happen.</p><p>
    <sup>38</sup>God in heaven [MTY] is [RHQ] the one who causes disasters to happen,</p><p>and he also causes good things to happen.</p><p>
    <sup>39</sup>
    So it is certainly not [RHQ] right for us, who are only humans, to complain</p><p>when he punishes us for the sins that we have committed.</p><p>
    <sup>40</sup>Instead, we should ◄examine/think carefully about► our behavior;</p><p>we should turn back to Yahweh.</p><p>
    <sup>41</sup>We should pray [IDM] sincerely and lift up our arms</p><p>toward God in heaven, and say,</p><p>
    <sup>42</sup>“We have sinned and rebelled against you,</p><p>and you have not forgiven us.</p><p>
    <sup>43</sup>You have surrounded us with your anger and pursued us;</p><p>you have slaughtered us without pitying us.</p><p>
    <sup>44</sup>You have hidden yourself in a cloud,</p><p>with the result that you do not hear us when we pray.</p><p>
    <sup>45</sup>You have caused the people of other nations to consider us</p><p>to be only garbage [DOU].</p><p>
    <sup>46</sup>All our enemies have insulted us.</p><p>
    <sup>47</sup>We are constantly afraid [DOU],</p><p>
    because we have experienced disasters and ruin [DOU].”</p><p>
    <sup>48</sup>I cry a lot</p><p>because my people have been destroyed.</p><p>
    <sup>49</sup>My tears continually flow;</p><p>they will not stop</p><p>
    <sup>50</sup>until Yahweh looks down from heaven and sees us.</p><p>
    <sup>51</sup>I am very grieved</p><p>because of what has happened to the women of my city.</p><p>
    <sup>52</sup>Those who are my enemies hunted for me</p><p>like [SIM] people hunt for a bird to kill it</p><p>
    even though there was no reason for them to do that.</p><p>
    <sup>53</sup>They threw me into a pit to kill me,</p><p>and they threw stones on top of me.</p><p>
    <sup>54</sup>The water in the pit rose above my head,</p><p>and I said to myself, “I am about to die/drown!”</p><p>
    <sup>55</sup>But from the bottom of the pit I cried out to you [MTY],</p><p>“Yahweh, help me!”</p><p>
    <sup>56</sup>I pleaded with you,</p><p>“Do not refuse to heed [MTY] me while I cry out to you!”</p><p>
    <sup>57</sup>Then you answered me</p><p>and said, “Do not be afraid!”</p><p>
    <sup>58</sup>Yahweh, you defended me;</p><p>you did not allow me to die.</p><p>
    <sup>59</sup>
    Now, Yahweh, you have seen the evil things that my enemies have done to me,</p><p>
    so decide my case and show that I am right!</p><p>
    <sup>60</sup>You know the evil things</p><p>that they have planned to do to me.</p><p>
    <sup>61</sup>Yahweh, you have heard them insult me</p><p>and what they have planned to do to me.</p><p>
    <sup>62</sup>Every day they whisper and mutter things about me,</p><p>all day long.</p><p>
    <sup>63</sup>Look at them! Whether they are standing or sitting</p><p>they make fun of me with the songs that they sing.</p><p>
    <sup>64</sup>Yahweh, cause them to suffer</p><p>in return for their causing me to suffer!</p><p>
    <sup>65</sup>Curse them [IDM]</p><p>
    for their being very stubborn [IDM].</p><p>
    <sup>66</sup>Because you are angry with them, pursue them and get rid of them,</p><p>
    until none of them remain on the earth.</p><a href="#LAMENTATIONS-c-4"><h3 id="LAMENTATIONS-c-4">4</h3></a>
<p>What happened when Jerusalem was destroyed</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Previously our people were like [MET] pure gold,</p><p>but now they are worthless.</p><p>
    Like [MET] the sacred stones in the temple have been scattered,</p><p>
    our young men have been scattered.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>The young men of Jerusalem were as valuable as [MET] large amounts of gold,</p><p>but now people consider that they are as worthless as ordinary clay pots.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Even the female jackals/wolves feed their pups,</p><p>but my people act cruelly toward their children;</p><p>they are like [SIM] ostriches in the desert that abandon their eggs.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    My people’s infants’ tongues cling to the roofs/tops of their mouths</p><p>because they are extremely thirsty;</p><p>the children plead for some food,</p><p>but no one gives them any.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>People who previously ate fine food</p><p>are now starving in the streets;</p><p>those who previously lived luxuriously [MTY]</p><p>
    now paw/dig through rubbish heaps to find some food.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    The people of Sodom were struck with a disaster very suddenly,</p><p>and there was no one to rescue them;</p><p>but my people have been punished</p><p>more severely than the people of Sodom were punished.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Our leaders’ behavior was previously very pure,</p><p>whiter and brighter than snow and milk;</p><p>their bodies were redder than red coral/stones;</p><p>they were very strong and healthy [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>But now their faces are blacker than soot,</p><p>and no one recognizes them in the streets.</p><p>Their skin has shriveled on their bones,</p><p>and it has become as dry as [SIM] a wooden stick.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>It is better to die in a battle [MTY]</p><p>than to die of hunger.</p><p>There was no food to harvest in the fields,</p><p>so the people slowly starved until they died.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Women who usually/previously were very kind</p><p>have killed and cooked their own children;</p><p>they ate them when there was no other food,</p><p>when Jerusalem was surrounded by enemy soldiers.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Yahweh has shown that he was extremely angry;</p><p>
    it is as though he started/ignited a fire in Jerusalem</p><p>that burned everything to ashes.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>None of the kings on the earth or anyone else</p><p>believed that any of our enemies could enter the gates of Jerusalem.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    But that is what happened;</p><p>it happened because the prophets sinned;</p><p>and the priests also sinned</p><p>by causing innocent people to be executed [MTY].</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>The prophets and priests wandered through the streets</p><p>
    as though they were blind.</p><p>No one would touch them</p><p>because their clothes were stained with the blood of people who had been killed.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>The people who were alive shouted, “Stay away from us [DOU]! You are defiled/untouchable!</p><p>Do not touch us!”</p><p>So the prophets and priests fled from Israel,</p><p>and they wandered around from one country to another,</p><p>because people in each country kept saying to them, “You cannot stay here!”</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>It is Yahweh himself who has scattered them;</p><p>he no longer is concerned about them.</p><p>People do not respect our priests or leaders.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>We [SYN] continued to look for someone to help us,</p><p>but it was useless.</p><p>We continued to watch to see if one of our allies would save us,</p><p>but none of the nations that we were waiting for could help us.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    Our enemies were hunting for us,</p><p>so we could not even walk in our streets lest they seize us.</p><p>We were about to be captured;</p><p>it was time for us to be killed.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Those who pursued us were faster than eagles flying in the sky.</p><p>Even if we fled to the mountains</p><p>or hid in the desert,</p><p>they went there ahead of us and waited to attack us.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    Our king, whom Yahweh appointed,</p><p>was the one who enabled us to remain alive [MTY];</p><p>he was the one whom we trusted to protect us [IDM]</p><p>from the armies of other nations.</p><p>But he was captured</p><p>
    like animals are [MET] caught in a pit.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>You people of [IDM] Edom and Uz,</p><p>
    you may be happy about what is happening to us now,</p><p>but Yahweh will be punishing [MTY] you also.</p><p>You will become drunk and will be ashamed</p><p>
    because your enemies will have stripped off your clothes.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>You people of [APO] Jerusalem,</p><p>the time of your being punished will end;</p><p>Yahweh will not allow you to continue to live in ◄exile/foreign countries►.</p><p>But you people of [APO] Edom, Yahweh will punish you;</p><p>he will reveal the wicked things that you have done.</p><a href="#LAMENTATIONS-c-5"><h3 id="LAMENTATIONS-c-5">5</h3></a>
<p>A prayer for God’s mercy</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh, think about what has happened to us.</p><p>See that we have been disgraced.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Foreigners have seized our property,</p><p>
    and now they live in our homes.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    Our enemies have killed our fathers;</p><p>they caused our mothers to become widows.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    Now we are required to pay for water to drink,</p><p>and we must pay a lot of money for firewood.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    It is as though those who pursue us are at our heels;</p><p>we are exhausted, but they do not allow us to rest.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>In order to get enough food to remain alive,</p><p>we went to Egypt and Assyria and offered to work for the people there.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Our ancestors sinned, and now they are dead,</p><p>but we are being punished for the sins that they committed.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    Officials from Babylon who were previously slaves now rule over us,</p><p>and there is no one who can rescue us from their power.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>When we roam around in the desert searching for food, we are in danger of being killed,</p><p>because people there kill strangers with their swords.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Our skin has become hot like [SIM] an oven,</p><p>and we have a very high fever because we are extremely hungry.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    Our enemies have raped the women in Jerusalem,</p><p>
    and they have done that to the young women in all the towns of Judea.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    Our enemies have hanged our leaders,</p><p>and they do not respect our elders.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>They force our young men to grind flour with millstones,</p><p>and boys stagger while they are forced to carry heavy loads of firewood.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    Our elders no longer sit at the city gates to make important decisions;</p><p>the young men no longer play their musical instruments.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>We [SYN] are no longer joyful;</p><p>instead of dancing joyfully, we now mourn.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>The wreaths of flowers have fallen off our heads.</p><p>Terrible things have happened to us because of the sins that we committed.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>We [SYN] are tired and discouraged [IDM],</p><p>and we cannot see well because our eyes are full of tears.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>Jerusalem is completely deserted,</p><p>and jackals/wolves prowl around it.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>But Yahweh, you rule forever!</p><p>You continue to rule [MTY] from one generation to the next generation.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    So why [RHQ] have you forgotten us?</p><p>Why [RHQ] have you abandoned us for a very long time?</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    Please enable us to return to you,</p><p>and enable us to prosper [MTY] as we did previously.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>Please do that, because we hope that [RHQ] you have not rejected us forever</p><p>and that [RHQ] you do not continue to be extremely angry with us!</p><a href="#LAMENTATIONS-h">^</a> <a href="#LAMENTATIONS-c-1">[1]</a> <a href="#LAMENTATIONS-c-2">[2]</a> <a href="#LAMENTATIONS-c-3">[3]</a> <a href="#LAMENTATIONS-c-4">[4]</a> <a href="#LAMENTATIONS-c-5">[5]</a>
