<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    I am Joel, the son of Pethuel. This is a message that Yahweh gave to me.</p><p>The attack by locusts</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>You leaders of Israel, and everyone else who lives in this country, listen to this message!</p><p>Nothing [RHQ] like this has ever happened during the time that we have lived</p><p>or the time when our ancestors lived.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Tell your children about it,</p><p>and tell your children to tell it to their children,</p><p>and tell your grandchildren to tell it to their children.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    I am talking about the locusts that have eaten our crops.</p><p>The first swarm of locusts came and cut many of the leaves of the crops;</p><p>then another swarm came and ate the rest of the leaves,</p><p>then another swarm came hopping along,</p><p>and finally another swarm came</p><p>and they destroyed everything else.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>You people who are drunk, wake up!</p><p>Wake up and wail loudly,</p><p>because all the grapes are ruined,</p><p>and so there will be no new wine [MTY]!</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    Huge swarms of locusts have entered our country.</p><p>
    They are like [MET] a powerful army</p><p>
    that has very many soldiers,</p><p>
    with the result that no one can count them.</p><p>The locusts have teeth that are as sharp as the teeth of lions [DOU]!</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>They have destroyed our grapevines and our fig trees</p><p>
    by stripping off and eating all the bark,</p><p>with the result that the branches are white and ◄bare/have no leaves on them►.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Cry like [SIM] a young woman cries</p><p>when the young man to whom she was ◄engaged/promised to marry► has died.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>There is no grain or wine for us to offer as sacrifices at the temple,</p><p>
    so the priests who serve Yahweh are mourning/weeping.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    The crops in the fields have been ruined;</p><p>
    it is as though [PRS] the ground is mourning.</p><p>The grain has been destroyed,</p><p>there are no grapes to make wine,</p><p>and there is no more olive  oil.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>You farmers, grieve!</p><p>You who take care of grapevines, wail,</p><p>because the grain has been destroyed;</p><p>there is no wheat or barley growing.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>The grapevines and the fig trees have withered,</p><p>and the pomegranate trees and palm trees and apricot trees have also dried up.</p><p>The people are no longer joyful.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>You priests, put on rough sack clothes and wail.</p><p>You who serve God by offering sacrifices on the altar,</p><p>wear those rough sack clothes all night to show that you are mourning,</p><p>because there is no grain or wine to be offered at the temple of your God.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>Tell the people that they should ◄fast/abstain from eating food►.</p><p>Tell the leaders and the other people to gather at the temple</p><p>and to cry out to Yahweh there.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>Terrible things are happening to us!</p><p>It will soon be the time when Yahweh, who is the Almighty God, will really punish us,</p><p>
    when he will cause us to experience more disasters.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>Our crops are already gone,</p><p>and no one is rejoicing at all [DOU] at the temple of our God.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    When we plant seeds, they do not grow;</p><p>they dry up in the ground,</p><p>so there are no crops to harvest.</p><p>Our barns/storehouses are empty;</p><p>there is no grain to store in them.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>Our cattle groan, searching for a pasture with some grass to eat,</p><p>and the sheep bleat because they are suffering.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Yahweh, I cry out to you,</p><p>because our pastures and our forests have dried up in the hot sunshine [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    It is as though even the wild animals cry out to you</p><p>because all the streams have dried up.</p><p>The rivers and streams are all dry,</p><p>and the grass in the pastures is all parched.</p><a href="#JOEL-c-2"><h3 id="JOEL-c-2">2</h3></a>
<p>A warning about the locusts</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Blow trumpets on Zion Hill,</p><p>God’s sacred hill in Jerusalem!</p><p>Tell the people of Judah that they should tremble,</p><p>because it will soon be the time for Yahweh to punish us further.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    That will be a very dark and gloomy day;</p><p>there will be black clouds and it will be very dark.</p><p>A huge swarm of locusts has covered the mountains like [SIM] a black cloud.</p><p>Nothing like this has ever happened before,</p><p>and nothing like this will ever happen again.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    It is as though the locusts bring flames of fire</p><p>from which no one can escape.</p><p>In front of them, the land was beautiful like [SIM] the garden of Eden,</p><p>but behind them the land is like a desert</p><p>and nothing survives.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    The locusts resemble horses,</p><p>and they run like [SIM] war horses.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Leaping over the mountaintops,</p><p>they make a noise like rumbling chariots,</p><p>like [SIM] a mighty army that is preparing for a battle,</p><p>or like [SIM] the roar of a fire that burns up stubble in a field.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>When people see them coming,</p><p>they become very pale and frightened.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    The locusts climb over walls like soldiers do;</p><p>they march along in columns</p><p>and never turn aside from their columns.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>They rush straight ahead</p><p>without pushing each other.</p><p>
    Even though people throw spears and javelins at them,</p><p>that will not cause them to stop.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>They swarm over the city walls and enter our houses;</p><p>they enter through our windows like [SIM] thieves do.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    It is as though they cause the earth to shake and the sky to tremble.</p><p>The sun and the moon become dark</p><p>and the stars do not shine</p><p>
    because there are so many locusts in the sky.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Yahweh leads this army of countless locusts,</p><p>and they obey his commands.</p><p>This time when he is judging and punishing us is very terrible,</p><p>
    with the result that it seems that no one [RHQ] can survive it.</p><p>Yahweh calls them to repent</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>But Yahweh says,</p><p>“In spite of these disasters that you have experienced,</p><p>you can return to me with all your inner beings.</p><p>Weep, and mourn, and ◄fast/abstain from eating food► to show that you are sorry for having abandoned me.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Do not tear your clothes</p><p>
    to show that you are sorry;</p><p>instead, show [MET] that you are sorry.”</p><p>Yahweh is merciful and kind;</p><p>he does not quickly become angry;</p><p>he faithfully loves people.</p><p>He does not quickly become angry;</p><p>instead, he greatly and faithfully loves you,</p><p>and he does not like to punish you.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>No one knows [RHQ] if he will change his mind about punishing you</p><p>and if instead he will act mercifully toward you.</p><p>If he does that, he will bless you</p><p>
    by giving you plenty of grain and wine</p><p>in order that you can offer some of  those things as sacrifices to him.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>Blow the trumpets on Zion Hill!</p><p>Gather the people together!</p><p>Show by fasting that you are sorry for the sins that you have committed.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>Perform the rituals to cause yourselves to be acceptable to Yahweh.</p><p>Gather everyone together—</p><p>the old people and the children, even the babies,</p><p>and summon brides and bridegrooms from their rooms.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Tell the priests who serve Yahweh to cry between the altar and the entrance to the temple</p><p>and to pray this:</p><p>“Yahweh, rescue/save us your people;</p><p>do not allow people from other nations to despise us;</p><p>do not allow them to ridicule us and say,</p><p>‘Why has [RHQ] their God abandoned them?’”</p><p>Yahweh promised to prosper them again</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>But Yahweh showed that he was concerned about his people</p><p>and that he would act mercifully toward them.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>When the people prayed,</p><p>Yahweh answered and said,</p><p>“I will give you plenty of grain and wine and olive oil,</p><p>and you will be satisfied.</p><p>And I will no longer allow other nations to insult you.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>Another army of locusts will come from the north to attack you,</p><p>but I will force them to continue past Jerusalem</p><p>into the desert.</p><p>Some will go into the Dead Sea in the east</p><p>and some will go into the Mediterranean Sea in the west.</p><p>
    There they will all die, and their bodies will stink.”</p><p>Yahweh does great things!</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>He does wonderful things!</p><p>So even the ground should rejoice!</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>And the wild animals should not be afraid,</p><p>because the meadows will soon become green again;</p><p>the fig trees and other trees will be full of fruit,</p><p>and the grapevines will be covered with grapes.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>You people of Jerusalem,</p><p>rejoice about what Yahweh, your God, will be doing for you.</p><p>He will send abundant rain at the ◄right time/time when it is needed►—</p><p>◄in the spring/early in the year► and ◄in the autumn/late in the year►</p><p>like he did previously.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>The ground where you thresh the grain will be covered with grain,</p><p>and your vats where you store grape juice and olive oil will be full.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    Yahweh said, “I will repay you for everything that was destroyed by those great swarms of locusts</p><p>that I sent to attack you.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>You, my people, will eat until your stomachs are full.</p><p>Then you will praise me [MTY], Yahweh, your God,</p><p>for the wonderful things that I have done for you.</p><p>And never again will you be disgraced.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>When that happens, you will know that I am always among you,</p><p>and that I am Yahweh, your God,</p><p>and that there is no other God.</p><p>Never again will you be disgraced.”</p><p>Yahweh promised to send his Spirit</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>“Some time later, I will give my Spirit to many [HYP] people.</p><p>Your sons and daughters will proclaim messages that come directly from me.</p><p>Your old men will have dreams that come from me,</p><p>and your young men will have visions that come from me.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>At that time, I will give my Spirit even to servants, both men and women.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>I will do unusual/amazing things on the earth and in the sky.</p><p>
    On the earth [CHI], there will be much blood shed</p><p>and there will be very large fires and smoke that resembles huge clouds.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>
    In the sky, the sun will become dark and the moon will become as red as [MET] blood.</p><p>
    Those things will happen before that great and terrible day when I, Yahweh, appear.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>But at that time I will save everyone who worships me.</p><p>I promise that some people in Jerusalem [DOU] will escape those disasters;</p><p>those whom I have chosen will survive.”</p><a href="#JOEL-c-3"><h3 id="JOEL-c-3">3</h3></a>
<p>Yahweh will judge the nations</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Yahweh says this:</p><p>“At that time [DOU], I will enable the people of Jerusalem and other places in Judah to prosper again.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    Then in the Valley of Judgment I will gather together the people of all the other nations;</p><p>I will judge and punish them</p><p>because they scattered my Israeli people</p><p>and forced them to go to other countries.</p><p>They divided up my land</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>and they ◄threw marked stones/cast lots► to determine who would get each of my people.</p><p>Then they sold some of the Israeli boys and girls</p><p>
    to get money to pay for prostitutes and wine to drink.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>You people of [APO] Tyre and Sidon cities and you people of the Philistia region, I certainly have not [RHQ] done anything to harm you! So if you are trying to get revenge on me, I will very quickly get revenge on you. <sup>5</sup>You have taken the silver and gold and other valuable things from my temple and put them in your temples. <sup>6</sup>You dragged away the people of Jerusalem and other places in Judah, and you took them far away and sold them to people in Greece.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>But I will cause my people to want to return from the places to which you sold them, and I will do to you what you did to them. <sup>8</sup>Then I will cause some of your sons and your daughters to be sold to the people of Judah! And some of them will be sold to the Sabea people-group, who live far away. That will certainly happen because I, Yahweh, have said it.”</p><p>God will judge and punish the nations</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Proclaim to the people of all nations,</p><p>“Prepare for a war!</p><p>Summon your soldiers,</p><p>and tell them to stand in their battle positions.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    Take your plows and make swords from them,</p><p>and take your pruning knives and make spears from them.</p><p>
    Even the weak people must also be like [MET] strong soldiers.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>All you people from the nations that are near Judah</p><p>must come quickly and gather in the Valley of Judgment.”</p><p>But Yahweh, when that happens, send your army of angels to attack them!</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>The people in the nations near Judah must get ready and come to the Valley of Judgment.</p><p>There Yahweh will sit and judge and punish them.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    They are like [MET] crops that are ready to be harvested;</p><p>so strike them like [MET] a farmer swings his sickle to cut the grain.</p><p>They are like [MET] grapes that are piled high in the pits where they will be pressed;</p><p>because they are very wicked,</p><p>
    punish them severely [MET] now,</p><p>like [MET] a farmer tramples on the grapes until the pits are full of juice.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    There will be huge crowds of people in that Valley of Judgment.</p><p>It will soon be the time that Yahweh will punish them.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    At that time there will be no light from the sun or moon,</p><p>and the stars will not shine.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>From Zion Hill in Jerusalem Yahweh will shout,</p><p>and his voice will be like thunder,</p><p>and his voice will cause the sky and the earth to shake.</p><p>But Yahweh will protect [MET] his people;</p><p>he will be like [MET] a strong wall behind which the people of Israel will be protected.</p><p>God’s blessings for his people</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    Yahweh says, “At that time, you Israeli people will know that I am Yahweh, your God.</p><p>I live on Zion, my sacred hill.</p><p>Jerusalem will be a sacred city,</p><p>and soldiers from other countries will never conquer it again.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>At that time, there will be vineyards covering [MTY] the hills,</p><p>and your cattle and goats on those hills will produce plenty of milk.</p><p>The streams in Judah will never dry up.</p><p>And a stream will flow from my temple into the Acacia Valley northeast of the Dead Sea.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    The armies of Egypt and Edom attacked the people of Judah</p><p>and killed [MTY] many people who had not done anything that was wrong.</p><p>So now those countries will become deserts,</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>but there will always be people living in Jerusalem and in other places in Judea.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    I, Yahweh, live on Zion Hill in Jerusalem,</p><p>and I will get revenge on the people of Egypt and Edom who killed [MTY] many of my people.”</p><a href="#JOEL-h">^</a> <a href="#JOEL-c-1">[1]</a> <a href="#JOEL-c-2">[2]</a> <a href="#JOEL-c-3">[3]</a>
