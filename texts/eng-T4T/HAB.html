<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    I am Habakkuk, a prophet. This is the message that Yahweh gave to me in a vision.</p><p>Habakkuk’s first complaint</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    I said, “Yahweh, how long must I continue to call to you for help</p><p>before you respond?</p><p>I cry out to you for help, saying that people are acting violently everywhere,</p><p>but you do not rescue us!</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>◄Must I/I do not want to► continue seeing people doing what is unjust [RHQ].</p><p>Why do you not punish people who are doing what is wrong [RHQ]?</p><p>I see people destroying things and acting violently.</p><p>There is fighting and quarreling everywhere.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>No one obeys laws [PRS],</p><p>and judges [PRS] never do what is fair/just.</p><p>Wicked people always defeat righteous people in the courts,</p><p>with the result that matters are never decided fairly/justly.”</p><p>Yahweh’s reply</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Yahweh replied to me,</p><p>“I know that what you say is true, but look around at what is happening in the other nations;</p><p>
    if you look, you will be amazed,</p><p>because I am doing something during this time that you would not believe would happen,</p><p>even if someone told you about it.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>The soldiers of Babylonia are fierce/cruel and swift.</p><p>And now I am causing them to become very powerful;</p><p>they will march across the world</p><p>and conquer many other countries.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>They are people whom others fear very much [DOU],</p><p>and they do whatever they want to,</p><p>paying no attention to the laws of other countries.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>The horses that pull their chariots go faster than leopards,</p><p>and they are fiercer than wolves are in the evening.</p><p>The horses on which the soldiers ride gallop swiftly;</p><p>the soldiers riding them come from distant places.</p><p>They are like [SIM] eagles that swoop down to snatch and kill small animals.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>As they ride along,</p><p>
    they are determined to act violently.</p><p>They advance like [SIM] a wind from the desert,</p><p>gathering prisoners that are as numerous as grains of sand.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>They make fun of kings and princes of other countries,</p><p>and they ridicule all the cities that have high walls around them.</p><p>They pile dirt outside those walls</p><p>
    in order to climb up and capture those cities.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>They rush past like the wind,</p><p>and then they go to attack other cities.</p><p>But they are very guilty,</p><p>because they think that their own power is their god.”</p><p>Habakkuk’s second complaint</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    Then I said, “Yahweh, you have certainly [RHQ] always/forever been God.</p><p>You are my Holy One; you will not die.</p><p>So why have you appointed those men from Babylonia to judge and get rid of us?</p><p>You are like [MET] a huge rock under which we are protected/safe,</p><p>so why have you sent them to punish us?</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>You [SYN] are pure, and you cannot endure looking at what is evil,</p><p>
    so why  are you ignoring men who are treacherous?</p><p>Why do you do nothing</p><p>
    to punish those wicked men from Babylonia</p><p>who destroy people who are more righteous than they are?</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    Do you consider that we are like fish in the sea,</p><p>or like other creatures in the sea, that have no ruler?</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    The soldiers of Babylonia think that we are fish [RHQ] for them to pull out of the sea with hooks</p><p>or to catch in their nets,</p><p>while they rejoice and celebrate.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>If they catch us, they will worship their weapons [MET] with which they captured us, and offer sacrifices to them</p><p>and burn incense in front of them!</p><p>
    They will say ‘Those weapons have enabled us to become rich and be able to eat expensive food.’</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    Will you allow them to continue to conquer people [MET] forever?</p><p>
    Will you allow them to destroy people of other nations without their being merciful to anyone?”</p><a href="#HABAKKUK-c-2"><h3 id="HABAKKUK-c-2">2</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    After I said that, I said to myself, “I will climb up into my watchtower,</p><p>and stand there at my guard post.</p><p>I will wait there to find out what Yahweh will say,</p><p>what he will reply to what I have complained about.”</p><p>Yahweh’s second reply</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Then Yahweh replied to me,</p><p>“Write plainly on tablets what I am revealing to you in this vision,</p><p>
    and then read it to a messenger</p><p>in order that he can run with it to tell it to other people.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>In this vision I will be talking about things that will happen in the future.</p><p>Now is not the time when those things will happen,</p><p>but they certainly will happen,</p><p>and when they occur, they will occur quickly,</p><p>and they will not be delayed.</p><p>Now you want those things to happen immediately, but they are not happening.</p><p>But wait patiently for them to happen!</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Think about the proud people of Babylonia!</p><p>They are certainly not doing what is righteous.</p><p>But people who are righteous will live</p><p>because they faithfully do what I want them to do.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>If people trust in their wealth, they will deceive themselves,</p><p>and proud people are never able to rest.</p><p>
    It is as though the greedy people of Babylonia open their mouths as wide as the place where dead people are,</p><p>and they never have enough,</p><p>like the place where dead people go never has enough dead people [PRS].</p><p>The armies of Babylonia conquer many nations for themselves,</p><p>and capture all their people.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>But soon all those whom they have captured will ridicule the soldiers from Babylonia!</p><p>They will make fun of them, saying,</p><p>‘Terrible things will happen to you who have stolen things from other countries!</p><p>You got many things by forcing people to give them to you.</p><p>
    But you certainly will not keep those things for a long time [RHQ]!’</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Suddenly those whom you ◄oppressed/treated cruelly► will cause you to tremble,</p><p>and they will take away all the things that you have stolen from them.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>You stole things from the people of many nations.</p><p>You murdered [MTY] people of many people-groups,</p><p>and you destroyed their land and their cities.</p><p>So those who are still alive will steal valuable things from you.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Terrible things will happen to you people of Babylonia who build big houses</p><p>with money that you got by forcing others to give it to you.</p><p>You are proud and you think that your houses will be safe</p><p>because you have built them in places where you can easily defend them.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>But because you have destroyed others,</p><p>you have caused your family [MTY] to be shamed/disgraced,</p><p>and you yourselves will be killed.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    It is as though the stones in the walls of your houses cry out to accuse you,</p><p>and it is as though the beams in your ceilings also say the same things.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Terrible things will happen to you people of Babylonia who kill people [MTY] in order to build cities,</p><p>cities that you build by using money that you have gotten by committing crimes.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>But the Commander of the armies of angels has [RHQ] declared that everything that is built by people who do things like that will be destroyed by fire;</p><p>they will have worked hard uselessly.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>But in contrast, like [SIM] the oceans are filled with water,</p><p>the earth will be filled with people who know that Yahweh is very great.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>Terrible things will happen to you people of Babylonia</p><p>who cause people who live in nearby countries to become drunk.</p><p>You force them to drink a lot of wine from wineskins</p><p>
    until they are drunk and then they walk around naked,</p><p>in order that you can see that.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>But you are the ones who soon will be disgraced instead of being honored.</p><p>
    It will be as though you are forced to drink a lot of wine in order that you will also stagger around, drunk.</p><p>You will drink the wine that symbolizes that Yahweh will punish you,</p><p>and he will cause you to be disgraced instead of being greatly respected any more.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>You did violent [PRS] things to the people in Lebanon,</p><p>and you killed the wild animals there,</p><p>but you will be punished severely for doing that.</p><p>You have killed [MTY] many people</p><p>and you have destroyed their lands and their cities.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    You people of Babylonia need to know that your idols are completely [RHQ] useless,</p><p>because it is people who made them.</p><p>Statues that have been carved or made in a mold deceive you.</p><p>Those who trust in idols</p><p>are trusting in things that they themselves created,</p><p>things that cannot speak!</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Terrible things will happen to you who say to lifeless idols that are made of wood,</p><p>‘Wake up!’</p><p>Idols certainly cannot [RHQ] tell you what you should do;</p><p>they look nice/beautiful because they are covered with silver and gold,</p><p>but they are not alive.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>But Yahweh is in his holy temple;</p><p>everyone on the earth should be silent in his presence.”</p><a href="#HABAKKUK-c-3"><h3 id="HABAKKUK-c-3">3</h3></a>
<p>A prayer sung by Habakkuk</p><p>
    <sup>1-2</sup>Yahweh, I have heard about you;</p><p>I revere you because of all the amazing things that you have done.</p><p>In our time, do again some of those things that you did long ago!</p><p>Even when you are angry with us,</p><p>be merciful to us!</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    In the vision, I saw God, the Holy One, coming from the Teman district in Edom;</p><p>
    and I also saw him coming from the Paran Hills in the Sinai area.</p><p>His glory filled the sky,</p><p>and the earth was full of people who were praising him.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>His glory was like [SIM] a sunrise;</p><p>rays flashed from his hands</p><p>where he hides his power.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>He sent plagues in front of him,</p><p>and other plagues came behind him.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>When he stopped, the earth shook.</p><p>When he looked at the nations,</p><p>
    all the people trembled.</p><p>The hills and mountains that have existed for a very long time [HYP] collapsed and crumbled.</p><p>Yahweh is the one who exists eternally/forever!</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    In the vision I saw the people who live in tents in the Cushan region being afflicted,</p><p>and the people in the Midian region trembling.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Yahweh, was it because you were angry with the rivers and streams that you were angry with them?</p><p>Did the seas cause you to be furious,</p><p>with the result that you rode through them with horses that were pulling chariots</p><p>that enabled you to defeat them?</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    It was as though you uncovered your bow,</p><p>took arrows from your quiver, and prepared to shoot them.</p><p>
    Then with lightning you split open the earth,</p><p>and streams burst forth.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    It is as though the mountains saw you doing that,</p><p>and they trembled.</p><p>Floods rushed by;</p><p>
    it was as though the deep ocean roared and caused its waves to rise up high.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>The sun and moon stopped moving in the sky</p><p>while your lightning flashed past like a swift arrow,</p><p>and your glittering spear flashed.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Being very angry [DOU], you walked across the earth</p><p>and trampled the armies of many nations.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>But you also went to rescue us, your people,</p><p>and to save the king (Or, people) whom you had chosen [MTY].</p><p>You struck down the leader [MTY] of those wicked people</p><p>and stripped off his clothes, from his head to his feet.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>With his own spear you destroyed the leader of those soldiers who rushed like [SIM] a whirlwind to attack and scatter us,</p><p>thinking that they could conquer us Israelis easily.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>You walked through the sea with your horses to destroy our enemies,</p><p>and caused the waves to surge.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>When I saw that vision,</p><p>my heart pounded</p><p>and my lips quivered</p><p>
    because I became afraid.</p><p>My legs became weak</p><p>and I shook, because I was terrified.</p><p>But I will wait quietly for the people of Babylonia, those who invaded our country, to experience disasters!</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    Therefore,</p><p>even if there are no blossoms on the fig trees,</p><p>and there are no grapes on the grapevines,</p><p>and even if there are no olives growing on the olive trees,</p><p>and there are no crops in the fields,</p><p>and even if the flocks of sheep and goats die in the fields,</p><p>and there are no cattle in the stalls/barns,</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>I will rejoice because I know Yahweh.</p><p>I will be joyful because Yahweh my God is the one who saves me!</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Yahweh the Lord is the one who causes me to be strong;</p><p>he enables me to climb ◄safely/without falling► in the rocky mountains, like [SIM] a deer does.</p><p>(This message is for the choir director:</p><p>
    When this prayer is sung, it is to be accompanied by people playing stringed instruments.)</p><a href="#HABAKKUK-h">^</a> <a href="#HABAKKUK-c-1">[1]</a> <a href="#HABAKKUK-c-2">[2]</a> <a href="#HABAKKUK-c-3">[3]</a>
