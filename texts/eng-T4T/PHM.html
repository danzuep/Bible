<p>Philemon 1-3</p><p>I, Paul, am writing this letter to you, Philemon, and to those with you. May God bless you(pl).</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    I, Paul, am a prisoner who serves Christ Jesus. I am here with Timothy, our fellow believer. I am writing this letter to you, Philemon, our dear friend and fellow worker. <sup>2</sup>I am also writing to your wife, Apphia, and to Archippus, who is like [MET] our fellow soldier because he serves Christ steadfastly together with us. I am also writing this to the congregation that meets/gathers in your (sg) house. <sup>3</sup>I pray that God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ will continue to act kindly toward you all and will continue to cause you to have inner peace.</p><p>I thank God and rejoice greatly because you have shown that you love God’s people.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>I always thank my God when I pray for you (sg), because I hear people say that you love all God’s people [CHI] <sup>5</sup>and that you continue to trust in the Lord Jesus. <sup>6</sup>I pray that as a result of your knowing all the good things that God/Christ has done for us, you may ◄be effective/influence many others► as you tell others what you believe, in order that they may honor Christ. <sup>7</sup>I have rejoiced greatly and have been greatly encouraged because you, my dear friend, have acted lovingly toward God’s people by encouraging them [SYN].</p><p>Because I know that you love God’s people, I request, rather than command you, to do what you ought to do for my spiritual son Onesimus.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>So I have a request/favor to ask of you. I am completely confident that I have authority to command you to do what you ought to do, because I am an apostle of Christ. <sup>9</sup>But because I know that you love God’s people, I request this instead of commanding you to do it. It is I, Paul, an old man and now also a prisoner because I serve Christ Jesus, who am requesting it. <sup>10</sup>I request that you do something for someone who has become like my own son because I told him about Christ [MET] while I have been a prisoner [MTY] here. His name is Onesimus. <sup>11</sup>Although his name, as you know, means ‘useful’, formerly he was useless to you. But now he is useful both to you and to me!</p><p>I am sending Onesimus back to you. He is as dear to me as my own self, and he will now be even dearer to you than he is to me.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Although ◄he is as dear to me as/I love him as much as I love► [MET] my own self [MTY], I am sending him back to you. <sup>13</sup>I would like to have kept him with me, in order that he might serve me on your behalf, while I am a prisoner [MTY] because of my preaching the message about Christ. <sup>14</sup>Nevertheless, because I had not yet asked you and you had not yet permitted me to keep him here with me, I decided not to keep him here. I decided that I should not do anything without your permitting it. I decided that you should help me only if you really want to help me. <sup>15</sup>Perhaps the reason that God permitted Onesimus to be separated from {to leave} you for a little while was that he would believe in Christ, and as a result you would have him ◄back/with you► forever! <sup>16</sup>You will no longer have him only as a slave. Instead, you will have him as someone who is more than a slave. You will have him as a fellow believer! He is especially dear to me, but he certainly will be more dear to you than he is to me (OR, I love him very much, but you will certainly love him more than I do), because now he not only belongs to you but he also belongs to the Lord.</p><p>If you consider me to be your partner, receive Onesimus as you would receive me. I guarantee to repay you whatever Onesimus owes you.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>So, if you consider me to be your partner in God’s work, receive him as you would receive me. <sup>18</sup>If he has wronged you in any manner or if he owes you anything, ◄charge that to me/tell me so that I can pay you►. <sup>19</sup>I, Paul, am now writing this in my own handwriting: I will repay you what he owes you, although I might mention to you that you owe me even more than Onesimus may owe you, because it was the result of my telling you about Christ that God saved you.</p><p>Please encourage me in this matter as you encourage other believers in Christ.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>◄Yes/I say it again►, my dear friend, because you and I both have a relationship with the Lord, I want you to do this for me. Encourage me [SYN] by receiving Onesimus kindly, just like you encourage others who believe in Christ.</p><p>I have written this letter to you confident of your compliance with my request.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>I have written this letter to you, confident that you will do what I am requesting you to do. In fact, I know that you will do even more than what I am requesting you to do.</p><p>Also, keep a guest room ready for me.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>Also, keep a guest room ready for me to stay in, because I confidently expect that as a result of your prayers for me, I will be released from prison and will come to you all.</p><p>My other fellow workers greet you(sg). May the Lord Jesus Christ bless you(pl) spiritually.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>Epaphras, who is suffering with me in prison because of his serving Christ Jesus, ◄sends his greetings to you/wants you to know that he is thinking fondly about you►. <sup>24</sup>Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, who are my other fellow workers, also ◄send their greetings to you/want you to know that they are thinking fondly about you►. <sup>25</sup>I pray that the Lord Jesus Christ will ◄continue to work kindly in all your lives/kindly keep accomplishing what he desires within you►.</p><a href="#PHILEMON-h">^</a> <a href="#PHILEMON-c-1">[1]</a>
