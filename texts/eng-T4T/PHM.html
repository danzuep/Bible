<p id="s1-PHM.1.11" class="usx-s1" >I am sending Onesimus back to you. He is as dear to me as my own self, and he will now be even dearer to you than he is to me.</p>

I would like to have kept him with me, in order that he might serve me on your behalf, while I am a prisoner [MTY] <span id="add-PHM.1.13" class="usx-add">because of my preaching</span> the message <span id="add-PHM.1.13" class="usx-add">about Christ</span>. <a href="#PHM.1.14"><sup id="PHM.1.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
Nevertheless, because <span id="add-PHM.1.14" class="usx-add">I had not yet asked you and</span> you had not yet permitted me <span id="add-PHM.1.14" class="usx-add">to keep him here with me</span>, I decided not to <span id="add-PHM.1.14" class="usx-add">keep him here.

Perhaps the reason that <span id="add-PHM.1.15" class="usx-add">God permitted</span> Onesimus to be separated from {to leave} you for a little while was that <span id="add-PHM.1.15" class="usx-add">he would believe in Christ, and as a result</span> you would have him ◄back/with you► forever! <a href="#PHM.1.16"><sup id="PHM.1.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
<span id="add-PHM.1.16" class="usx-add">You will no longer have him only</span> as a slave.
