He belonged to the <span id="add-LUK.1.5" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">group of priests called</span> the Abijah group. He and his wife Elizabeth were both descended from the <span id="add-LUK.1.5" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">first priest of Israel</span>, Aaron. <a href="#LUK.1.6"><sup id="LUK.1.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
<span id="add-LUK.1.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">God considered that</span> both of them were righteous, because they constantly completely obeyed everything that God had commanded. <a href="#LUK.1.7"><sup id="LUK.1.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
But they had no children, because Elizabeth had been unable to bear children. Furthermore, she and her husband were very old.</p>

Following their custom, <span id="add-LUK.1.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the other priests</span> chose him by lot to enter the Lord’s temple and burn incense. <a href="#LUK.1.10"><sup id="LUK.1.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
While he was burning the incense, many people were outside <span id="add-LUK.1.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in the courtyard</span>, praying. <a href="#LUK.1.11"><sup id="LUK.1.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
Then an angel whom God had <span id="add-LUK.1.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">sent</span> appeared to him.

God will consider him to be very important. He must never drink wine or any other alcoholic drink, <span id="add-LUK.1.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in order that he will be completely dedicated to God</span>.

When Zechariah came out, he was not able to speak to the people.

The result was that the boats were so full that they began to sink. <a href="#LUK.5.8-9"><sup id="LUK.5.8-9" class="usx-v">8-9</sup></a>
Simon and all the men who were with him were amazed at how many fish they had taken. James and John, the two sons of Zebedee, who were Simon’s partners, were among those who were amazed. When Simon, <span id="add-LUK.5.8-9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">whose other name was</span> Peter, saw <span id="add-LUK.5.8-9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the fish, feeling ashamed to be in the presence of someone who obviously had God’s power</span>, he prostrated himself before Jesus and said, “Lord, you should go away from me, because I am a sinful man!” <a href="#LUK.5.10"><sup id="LUK.5.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>

While <span id="add-LUK.5.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Jesus</span> was in one of the cities <span id="add-LUK.5.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">there in the district of Galilee</span>, there was a man there who was very severely affected by leprosy.

<span id="add-LUK.5.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Then Jesus, disregarding the religious law that forbade people to come close to lepers</span>, reached out his hand and touched the man. He said, “I am willing <span id="add-LUK.5.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to heal you</span>; and I heal you now!” Immediately the man <span id="add-LUK.5.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">was healed</span>.

Then Jesus told him, “Make sure that you do not report <span id="add-LUK.5.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">your healing immediately. First, go to a priest in Jerusalem</span> and show yourself to him <span id="add-LUK.5.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">so that he can examine you and verify that you no longer have leprosy</span>.

The men who taught the <span id="add-LUK.5.21" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Jewish</span> laws and the rest of the Pharisees began to think within themselves, “Who does this man <span id="add-LUK.5.21" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">think he is, saying</span> that?

But <span id="add-LUK.20.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">after the servant arrived</span>, they beat him and they did not give him any grapes.

He will come and kill those men who were taking care of the vineyard.

They were joyful and amazed, <span id="add-LUK.24.41" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">but</span> they still did not believe <span id="add-LUK.24.41" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that he was really alive</span> (OR, <span id="add-LUK.24.41" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that Jesus was the one that they were seeing</span>). <span id="add-LUK.24.41" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">So</span> he said to them, “Do you have anything here to eat?” <a href="#LUK.24.42"><sup id="LUK.24.42" class="usx-v">42</sup></a>
<span id="add-LUK.24.42" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">So</span> they gave him a piece of broiled fish. <a href="#LUK.24.43"><sup id="LUK.24.43" class="usx-v">43</sup></a>

Then he said to them, “<span id="add-LUK.24.44" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">I will repeat</span> what I told you while I was still with you: Everything that was written about me by Moses and the <span id="add-LUK.24.44" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">other</span> prophets [MTY] and in the Psalms must be fulfilled!” <a href="#LUK.24.45"><sup id="LUK.24.45" class="usx-v">45</sup></a>
Then he enabled them to understand <span id="add-LUK.24.45" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the things that had been written about him in</span> the Scriptures. <a href="#LUK.24.46"><sup id="LUK.24.46" class="usx-v">46</sup></a>
He said to them, “This is what they wrote: That the Messiah would suffer <span id="add-LUK.24.46" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and die</span>, but on the third day after that he would become alive again. <a href="#LUK.24.47"><sup id="LUK.24.47" class="usx-v">47</sup></a>

They wrote that they should start <span id="add-LUK.24.47" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">preaching</span> it in Jerusalem, and then <span id="add-LUK.24.47" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">go and</span> preach it to all ethnic groups. <a href="#LUK.24.48"><sup id="LUK.24.48" class="usx-v">48</sup></a>
You <span id="add-LUK.24.48" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">apostles</span> must tell people that you know that those things <span id="add-LUK.24.48" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that happened to me</span> are true. <a href="#LUK.24.49"><sup id="LUK.24.49" class="usx-v">49</sup></a>
And I want you to know that I will send the <span id="add-LUK.24.49" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Holy Spirit</span> [MTY] to you, as my Father promised that <span id="add-LUK.24.49" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">he would do</span>.

As he was doing that, he left them <span id="add-LUK.24.51" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and went up to heaven</span>. <a href="#LUK.24.52"><sup id="LUK.24.52" class="usx-v">52</sup></a>
They worshipped him. And then they returned to Jerusalem very joyfully. <a href="#LUK.24.53"><sup id="LUK.24.53" class="usx-v">53</sup></a>
Each day [SYN] they went into the Temple <span id="add-LUK.24.53" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">courtyard</span>, and spent a lot of time praising God.</p>
