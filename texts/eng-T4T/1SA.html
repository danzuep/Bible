There was a man named Elkanah who lived in Ramah <span id="add-1SA.1.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">town</span> in the hilly area where <span id="add-1SA.1.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the tribe of</span> Ephraim lived. His father was Jeroham, his grandfather was Elihu, and his great-grandfather was Tohu. He belonged to the Zuph clan. <a href="#1SA.1.2"><sup id="1SA.1.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
He had two wives: Hannah and Peninnah. Peninnah had several children, but Hannah had no children.</p>
<p id="p-1SA.1.2" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.1.3"><sup id="1SA.1.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
Once every year Elkanah went up <span id="add-1SA.1.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">with his family</span> from Ramah to Shiloh <span id="add-1SA.1.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">city</span>. He went there to worship Yahweh, <span id="add-1SA.1.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the commander </span> of the armies <span id="add-1SA.1.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">of angels</span>, and to offer sacrifices to him. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, <span id="add-1SA.1.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">helped their father to do the work as</span> priests of Yahweh there. <a href="#1SA.1.4"><sup id="1SA.1.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
Each time Elkanah offered sacrifices there, he gave some of the meat to Peninnah and some to each of her sons and daughters. <a href="#1SA.1.5"><sup id="1SA.1.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
But even though he loved Hannah very much, he gave her only one special amount of meat because Yahweh had not permitted her to give birth to any children. <a href="#1SA.1.6"><sup id="1SA.1.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
And his other wife, Peninnah, would ridicule Hannah to make her feel miserable, because Yahweh had not allowed her to bear children. <a href="#1SA.1.7"><sup id="1SA.1.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
This happened every year. When they went up to the temple of Yahweh <span id="add-1SA.1.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">at Shiloh</span>, Peninnah ridiculed Hannah so much that Hannah cried and would not eat. <a href="#1SA.1.8"><sup id="1SA.1.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
Then Elkanah would say to her, “Hannah, ◄why are you crying?/please quit crying!► [RHQ] ◄Why are you not eating?/Please eat something!► [RHQ] Why are you so upset/sad? You have me; is that not more important to you than if you had ten sons? (OR, I <span id="add-1SA.1.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">love you</span> more than your sons <span id="add-1SA.1.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">would love you</span>, even if you had ten sons.)”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.1.8" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.1.9"><sup id="1SA.1.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
One year, after they had finished eating and drinking at Shiloh, Hannah stood up <span id="add-1SA.1.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to pray</span>. Eli the priest was nearby, sitting on a chair by the doorway of the sacred tent of Yahweh. <a href="#1SA.1.10"><sup id="1SA.1.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
Hannah was very distressed, and she cried very sorrowfully as she prayed to Yahweh. <a href="#1SA.1.11"><sup id="1SA.1.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
She made a vow saying, “O Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, if you will look at me and see how miserable I am, and think about me and allow me to give birth to a son, then I will dedicate him to you <span id="add-1SA.1.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to serve you</span> for the rest of his life. And <span id="add-1SA.1.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to show that he is dedicated to you</span>, ◄no one will ever <span id="add-1SA.1.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">be allowed to</span> cut his hair/his hair will never be cut►.”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.1.11" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.1.12"><sup id="1SA.1.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
As she was praying like that to Yahweh, Eli the priest saw Hannah’s lips <span id="add-1SA.1.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">moving as she was praying</span>. <a href="#1SA.1.13"><sup id="1SA.1.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
But Hannah was only praying silently; she was not making any sound. So Eli thought that she was drunk. <a href="#1SA.1.14"><sup id="1SA.1.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
He said to her, “How long will you continue to get drunk [RHQ]? ◄Throw away your wine/Quit drinking wine►!”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.1.14" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.1.15"><sup id="1SA.1.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
Hannah replied, “Sir, I am not drunk! I have not been drinking wine or any other alcoholic drink. I feel very distressed and I have been telling Yahweh about how I feel. <a href="#1SA.1.16"><sup id="1SA.1.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
Do not think that I am a worthless/wicked woman! I have been praying like this because I am very distressed [DOU].”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.1.16" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.1.17"><sup id="1SA.1.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
Eli replied, “I wish/desire that things will go well for you. I desire that God, the one we Israeli people <span id="add-1SA.1.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">worship</span>, will give you what you requested from him.”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.1.17" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.1.18"><sup id="1SA.1.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
She replied, “I want you to think highly/well about me.” Then she returned <span id="add-1SA.1.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to her family</span> and after she ate something, her face no longer looked sad.</p>
<p id="p-1SA.1.18" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.1.19"><sup id="1SA.1.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
Early the next morning, Elkanah and his family got up and worshiped Yahweh <span id="add-1SA.1.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">again</span>, and then they returned to their home at Ramah. Elkanah ◄slept with/had sex with► Hannah. Then Yahweh answered her prayer, <a href="#1SA.1.20"><sup id="1SA.1.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, <span id="add-1SA.1.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">which sounds like the words in the Hebrew language that mean ‘heard by God’</span>, because she said “Yahweh <span id="add-1SA.1.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">heard me when</span> I requested from him <span id="add-1SA.1.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">a son</span>.”</p>
<p id="s1-1SA.1.20" class="usx-s1" >Hannah dedicated Samuel to Yahweh</p>
<p id="p-1SA.1.20" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.1.21"><sup id="1SA.1.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
The following year, Elkanah again went up <span id="add-1SA.1.21" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to Shiloh</span> with his family to make the kind of sacrifice he made each year, and also to give a special offering to God that he had promised <span id="add-1SA.1.21" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to give him previously</span>. <a href="#1SA.1.22"><sup id="1SA.1.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
But Hannah did not go <span id="add-1SA.1.22" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">with them</span>. She said to her husband, “After I have weaned the baby, I will take him <span id="add-1SA.1.22" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to Shiloh and present him</span> to Yahweh, and he will stay there for the rest of his life.”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.1.22" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.1.23"><sup id="1SA.1.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
Elkanah said, “Do what seems the best to you. Stay here until you have weaned him. What I desire is that Yahweh will <span id="add-1SA.1.23" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">enable you to</span> do what you have promised.” So Hannah stayed at home and nursed her son until she weaned him.</p>
<p id="p-1SA.1.23" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.1.24"><sup id="1SA.1.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
After she weaned him, even though Samuel was very young, she took him to the temple/house of Yahweh at Shiloh. <span id="add-1SA.1.24" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">To offer as a sacrifice</span>, she took along a three-year-old bull, <span id="add-1SA.1.24" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">a sack containing</span> ◄20 pounds/9 kg.► of flour, and a container of wine. <a href="#1SA.1.25"><sup id="1SA.1.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
After the priest had slaughtered the bull <span id="add-1SA.1.25" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and offered it to Yahweh on the altar</span>, Hannah and Elkanah brought the boy to Eli. <a href="#1SA.1.26"><sup id="1SA.1.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
Then Hannah said to him, “Sir, ◄Do you remember me?/I solemnly affirm►, I am the woman who prayed as I stood here beside you <span id="add-1SA.1.26" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">several years ago</span>. <a href="#1SA.1.27"><sup id="1SA.1.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
I prayed that Yahweh would enable me to give birth to a child, and this is the child whom I requested Yahweh to give me. <a href="#1SA.1.28"><sup id="1SA.1.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
So now I am presenting him to Yahweh. He will belong to Yahweh as long as he lives.” Then Elkanah <span id="add-1SA.1.28" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and his family</span> worshiped Yahweh there.</p>
<a href="#1SA.2"><h3 id="1SA.2" class="usx-c">2</h3></a>
<p id="p-1SA.2" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.2.1"><sup id="1SA.2.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
Then Hannah prayed, saying,</p>

Eli’s two sons<span id="add-1SA.2.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">, who were also priests,</span> were very wicked. They did not revere (OR, respect/obey) Yahweh. <a href="#1SA.2.13"><sup id="1SA.2.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
While the people were boiling the meat from their sacrifices <span id="add-1SA.2.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in the huge pot at the temple</span>, one of Eli’s sons, <span id="add-1SA.2.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">would send his servant to come with a large three-pronged fork in his hand</span>. <a href="#1SA.2.14"><sup id="1SA.2.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
<span id="add-1SA.2.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">He</span> would stick the fork into <span id="add-1SA.2.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the meat in</span> the pot, and whatever meat fastened onto the fork, he would take <span id="add-1SA.2.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and give it</span> to the priest who sent him. Eli’s sons did this to all the Israeli people who came to Shiloh <span id="add-1SA.2.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to offer sacrifices</span>. <a href="#1SA.2.15"><sup id="1SA.2.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>

He ran from the place where the armies were fighting, and he arrived at Shiloh late <span id="add-1SA.4.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that afternoon</span>. <a href="#1SA.4.13"><sup id="1SA.4.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Eli was waiting beside the road. <span id="add-1SA.4.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">He wanted to hear news about the battle, and</span> he was also very anxious to know if anything bad had happened to God’s sacred chest.

    <a href="#1SA.4.14"><sup id="1SA.4.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
Eli asked, “Why are they making all that noise?” The messenger ran over to Eli and told him the news.</p>

    <a href="#1SA.4.15"><sup id="1SA.4.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
At that time, Eli was 98 years old, and he was blind. <a href="#1SA.4.16"><sup id="1SA.4.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
The messenger said to Eli, “I have just come from where the armies were fighting. I left there earlier today.” Eli asked, “What happened?”</p>

    <a href="#1SA.4.17"><sup id="1SA.4.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
The man replied, “The Philistines defeated our Israeli army. They killed thousands of our soldiers, and the others ran away. The Philistines killed your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas. They also captured God’s sacred chest.”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.4.17" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.4.18"><sup id="1SA.4.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
Eli was very old, and he was very fat; and when he heard what had happened to the sacred chest, he fell backward from his chair beside the town gate. His neck was broken and he died. He had led the Israeli people for 40 years before he died.</p>

The wife/widow of Eli’s son Phinehas was pregnant, and it was almost time for her to give birth to her baby. When she heard that God’s sacred chest had been captured and that her husband and her father-in-law were dead, her labor pains suddenly began. She quickly gave birth to a boy. <a href="#1SA.4.20"><sup id="1SA.4.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
The women who were helping her tried to encourage her by saying to her, “You have given birth to a son!” But she did not pay any attention [DOU] to what they said.</p>

    <a href="#1SA.4.21"><sup id="1SA.4.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
She named the boy Ichabod, which means ‘no glory’, because she said, “<span id="add-1SA.4.21" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">God’s</span> glory has departed from Israel.” She said that because God’s sacred chest had been captured and because her husband and her father-in-law had died. <a href="#1SA.4.22"><sup id="1SA.4.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>

<p id="p-1SA.5" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.5.1"><sup id="1SA.5.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
After the army of the Philistia people-group captured God’s sacred chest in Ebenezer <span id="add-1SA.5.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">town</span>, they took it to Ashdod <span id="add-1SA.5.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">which is one of their biggest cities</span>. <a href="#1SA.5.2"><sup id="1SA.5.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
They carried it into the temple of <span id="add-1SA.5.2" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">their god</span> Dagon, and placed it alongside a statue of Dagon. <a href="#1SA.5.3"><sup id="1SA.5.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
But early the next morning, when the people of Ashdod <span id="add-1SA.5.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">went to see it, they saw that</span> the statue had fallen on its face in front of Yahweh’s sacred chest! So they set the statue up in its place again. <a href="#1SA.5.4"><sup id="1SA.5.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
But the following morning, <span id="add-1SA.5.4" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">they saw that</span> it had fallen down in front of the sacred chest again. But this time, the statue’s head and hands had broken off, and were lying in the doorway. Only its body remained intact/unbroken. <a href="#1SA.5.5"><sup id="1SA.5.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
That is the reason that since that time, the priests of Dagon and everyone else who enters the temple of Dagon in Ashdod do not step on the doorsill <span id="add-1SA.5.5" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">where the hands and head of Dagon fell</span>.</p>
<p id="p-1SA.5.5" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.5.6"><sup id="1SA.5.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
Then Yahweh [SYN] powerfully caused the people of Ashdod and the people who lived in nearby villages to have ◄a very great plague/serious illness► of tumors. <a href="#1SA.5.7"><sup id="1SA.5.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
The men of Ashdod realized why this was happening, and they cried out, “The god of the Israeli people is punishing us and is also punishing our god Dagon. So we cannot allow the sacred chest of the god of the Israelis to remain here!” <a href="#1SA.5.8"><sup id="1SA.5.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
They summoned the five kings of the Philistia people-group, and asked them, “What should we do with the sacred chest of the god of the Israelis?”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.5.8" class="usx-p" >The kings replied, “Take the sacred chest to Gath <span id="add-1SA.5.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">city</span>.” So they moved it to Gath. <a href="#1SA.5.9"><sup id="1SA.5.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
But after they took it to Gath, Yahweh powerfully struck the people of that city also, with the result that many men, including young men and old men, got tumors on their skin. Then the people became very afraid. <a href="#1SA.5.10"><sup id="1SA.5.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
So they took the sacred chest to Ekron <span id="add-1SA.5.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">city</span>.</p>
<p id="p-1SA.5.10" class="usx-p" >But when the men carried the sacred chest into Ekron, the people there cried out, “Why are you bringing the sacred chest of the God of the Israelis into our city [RHQ]? <span id="add-1SA.5.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">By doing that</span> you will cause us and the rest of our people to die!” <a href="#1SA.5.11"><sup id="1SA.5.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
The people were terrified/in panic because <span id="add-1SA.5.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">they knew that</span> God was starting to punish them severely. So they summoned the <span id="add-1SA.5.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">five</span> kings of the Philistia people-group again, and <span id="add-1SA.5.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">pleaded with them</span>, saying, “Take this sacred chest of the god of the Israelis back to its own place!

Some of the people in Ekron had already died, and the rest of the people were suffering because of tumors on their skin. So they all cried out to their gods [MTY] <span id="add-1SA.5.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to help them</span>.</p>

    <a href="#1SA.6.1"><sup id="1SA.6.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
The people of Philistia kept God’s sacred chest in their area for seven months. <a href="#1SA.6.2"><sup id="1SA.6.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
Then they summoned their priests and their ◄diviners/men who practice rituals to find out what would happen in the future►. They asked them, “What should we do with the sacred chest of Yahweh? Tell us how we should send it back to its own land.”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.6.2" class="usx-p" >

Those men replied, “Send with it an offering <span id="add-1SA.6.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to show Yahweh that you know that you are</span> guilty <span id="add-1SA.6.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">for having captured the chest</span>, in order that the plague will stop.

    <a href="#1SA.6.4"><sup id="1SA.6.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
The people of Philistia asked, “What kind of offering should we send?”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.6.4" class="usx-p" >The men replied, “Make five gold models of the tumors on your skin, and five gold models of rats.

Make models that represent the rats and the tumors that are ruining your land. Make them in order to honor the god of the Israeli people. If you do that, perhaps he will stop punishing [IDM] you, and your gods, and your land. <a href="#1SA.6.6"><sup id="1SA.6.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
Do not be [RHQ] stubborn [IDM] like the Egyptians and their king were. <span id="add-1SA.6.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">They did not do what the Israelis’ god told them to do, so he punished them</span>. After the Israelis’ god finished punishing them very severely, they were glad to allow the Israelis to leave their country [RHQ].</p>
<p id="p-1SA.6.6" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.6.7"><sup id="1SA.6.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
“So you must build a new cart. Then get two cows that have very recently given birth to calves. They must be cows that have never been hitched to a cart [MTY].

Put the Israelis’ god’s sacred chest on the cart. Also put in the cart the five gold models of the tumors on your skin and the five gold models of rats.

    <a href="#1SA.6.10"><sup id="1SA.6.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
So the people did what the priests and men who predicted what would happen in the future told them to do.

They put in the cart Yahweh’s sacred chest and the box with the models of the gold rats and the tumors. <a href="#1SA.6.12"><sup id="1SA.6.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
Then the cows started walking, and they went straight toward Beth-Shemesh. They stayed on the road, and were mooing all the time. They did not turn to the left or to the right. The five kings of the Philistia area followed the cows until they reached the edge of Beth-Shemesh.</p>
<p id="p-1SA.6.12" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.6.13"><sup id="1SA.6.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
At that time, the people of Beth-Shemesh were harvesting wheat in the valley <span id="add-1SA.6.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">outside the city</span>. <span id="add-1SA.6.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">When the cows came along the road</span>, they looked up and saw the sacred chest.

The cows pulled the cart into the field of a man named Joshua, and they stopped alongside a large rock. Several men from the tribe of Levi lifted from the cart the sacred chest and the box containing the gold models of the rats and the tumors, and they put them all on the large rock. Then the people smashed the cart and kindled a fire with the wood <span id="add-1SA.6.14-15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">from which the cart had been made</span>. They slaughtered the cows and burned their bodies/carcasses on the fire to be an offering for Yahweh that would be completely burned. That day the people of Beth-Shemesh offered to Yahweh <span id="add-1SA.6.14-15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">many</span> sacrifices that were completely burned, and <span id="add-1SA.6.14-15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">other</span> sacrifices. <a href="#1SA.6.16"><sup id="1SA.6.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>

    <a href="#1SA.6.17"><sup id="1SA.6.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
The five gold models of tumors that they sent to be an offering to Yahweh to show that they knew that they deserved to be punished were gifts from <span id="add-1SA.6.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">those five kings who were rulers of</span> Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron <span id="add-1SA.6.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">cities</span>. <a href="#1SA.6.18"><sup id="1SA.6.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
The models of the five gold rats were gifts from the people of those five cities and the surrounding towns.

The sacred chest stayed in Kiriath-Jearim for a long time—a total of 20 years.

Then Samuel said to all the Israeli people, “If you truly [IDM] want to act like Yahweh’s people should, you must get rid of your statues of <span id="add-1SA.7.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the goddess</span> Astarte and the idols/statues of all the other foreign gods.

So they gathered at Mizpah, which was the town where Samuel previously was the leader of the Israeli people. They had a big ceremony there.

When the kings of the Philistia area heard that the Israeli people had gathered at Mizpah, they led their armies there to attack the Israelis.

They told Samuel, “Pray to Yahweh to rescue us from the Philistia army [MTY], and do not stop pleading!” <a href="#1SA.7.9"><sup id="1SA.7.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
So Samuel took a very young lamb <span id="add-1SA.7.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and killed it</span> and offered it to Yahweh to be a sacrifice that was completely burned <span id="add-1SA.7.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">on the altar</span>. Then he prayed and pleaded that Yahweh <span id="add-1SA.7.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">would help</span> the Israelis, and Yahweh did help them.</p>

While Samuel was burning the offering, the Philistia army came near to attack the Israelis. But Yahweh caused it to thunder very loudly.

So the Israelis were able to defeat them. <a href="#1SA.7.11"><sup id="1SA.7.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
The Israeli men ran out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistia soldiers almost to Beth-Car <span id="add-1SA.7.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">town</span>, and killed many Philistia soldiers while they were trying to run away.</p>

After that happened, Samuel took a large stone and set it up between Mizpah and Jeshanah <span id="add-1SA.7.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">towns</span>. He named the stone ‘Ebenezer’, <span id="add-1SA.7.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">which means ‘stone of help’</span>, because he said “Yahweh has helped us until the present time.” <a href="#1SA.7.13"><sup id="1SA.7.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
So the Philistia people were defeated, and for a long time they did not enter the Israeli land <span id="add-1SA.7.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to attack them</span> again. During the time that Samuel was alive, Yahweh powerfully protected [MTY] <span id="add-1SA.7.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the Israeli people</span> from <span id="add-1SA.7.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">being attacked by</span> the Philistia army.</p>
<p id="p-1SA.7.13" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.7.14"><sup id="1SA.7.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
The Israeli army was able to capture again the Israeli villages between Ekron and Gath that the Philistia army had captured before. The Israelis were also able to take again the other areas around those cities that the Philistia army had taken <span id="add-1SA.7.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">from the Israelis</span> previously. And there was peace between the Israelis and the Amor people-group.</p>
<p id="p-1SA.7.14" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.7.15"><sup id="1SA.7.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
Samuel continued to be the leader of the Israeli people until he died. <a href="#1SA.7.16"><sup id="1SA.7.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
As long as he was alive, every year he traveled back and forth between Bethel and Gilgal and Mizpah <span id="add-1SA.7.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">cities</span>. In those cities he listened to disputes between people and made decisions about them. <a href="#1SA.7.17"><sup id="1SA.7.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
After he listened to disputes and made decisions in each of those towns, he returned to his home at Ramah, and he would listen to people’s disputes there, also, <span id="add-1SA.7.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and make decisions about them</span>. And he built an altar at Ramah <span id="add-1SA.7.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to offer sacrifices</span> to Yahweh.</p>
<a href="#1SA.8"><h3 id="1SA.8" class="usx-c">8</h3></a>
<p id="s1-1SA.8" class="usx-s1" >The Israelis asked for a king</p>

    <a href="#1SA.8.1"><sup id="1SA.8.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
When Samuel became old, he appointed his two sons, Joel and Abijah, to lead/rule the people of Israel. <a href="#1SA.8.2"><sup id="1SA.8.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
They judged people’s disputes/cases in Beersheba <span id="add-1SA.8.2" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">town</span>. <a href="#1SA.8.3"><sup id="1SA.8.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
But they were not like their father. They wanted only to get a lot of money. They accepted bribes, and they did not make honest decisions about people’s disputes/cases.</p>
<p id="p-1SA.8.3" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.8.4"><sup id="1SA.8.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
Finally, the Israeli leaders met at Ramah <span id="add-1SA.8.4" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">town to discuss the matter</span> with Samuel. <a href="#1SA.8.5"><sup id="1SA.8.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
They said to him, “Listen! You are now old, and your sons are not like you. Appoint a king to rule over us, like the kings that other countries have!”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.8.5" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.8.6"><sup id="1SA.8.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
Samuel was very unhappy with them for requesting that, so he prayed to Yahweh about it. <a href="#1SA.8.7"><sup id="1SA.8.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Yahweh replied, “Do what they have requested you to do. But ◄<span id="add-1SA.8.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">do not think/the truth is not</span>► that you are the one whom they are really rejecting.

Ever since I brought them out of Egypt, they have rejected me, and they have worshiped other gods. And now they are also rejecting you in the same way. <a href="#1SA.8.9"><sup id="1SA.8.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
Do what they are asking you to do. But warn/tell them about how their kings will act toward them!”</p>

    <a href="#1SA.8.10"><sup id="1SA.8.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
So Samuel told those people what Yahweh had said. <a href="#1SA.8.11"><sup id="1SA.8.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
He said, “If a king rules over you, this is what he will do to you: He will force many of your sons to join the army. He will make <span id="add-1SA.8.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">some of</span> them run in front of his chariots <span id="add-1SA.8.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to clear people out of his way</span>. <a href="#1SA.8.12"><sup id="1SA.8.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
<span id="add-1SA.8.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Some of</span> them will be commanders of his soldiers, but others will work for him like slaves. He will force some of them to plow his fields and <span id="add-1SA.8.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">then later</span> harvest his crops. He will force others to make his weapons and equipment for his chariots. <a href="#1SA.8.13"><sup id="1SA.8.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
The king will take <span id="add-1SA.8.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">some of</span> your daughters <span id="add-1SA.8.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">from you and force them</span> to make perfumes for him and cook food for him and bake <span id="add-1SA.8.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">bread for him</span>. <a href="#1SA.8.14"><sup id="1SA.8.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
He will take your best fields and vineyards and olive tree groves/orchards, and give them to his own officials. <a href="#1SA.8.15"><sup id="1SA.8.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
He will take a tenth of your harvests and distribute it among the officers and servants <span id="add-1SA.8.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">who work in</span> his <span id="add-1SA.8.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">palace</span>. <a href="#1SA.8.16"><sup id="1SA.8.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
He will take from you your male and female servants, your best cattle and donkeys, and force them to work for him. <a href="#1SA.8.17"><sup id="1SA.8.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
He will take one tenth of your sheep and goats. And you will become his slaves! <a href="#1SA.8.18"><sup id="1SA.8.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
When that time comes, you will complain loudly to the king, the king that you yourselves have chosen, but Yahweh will not ◄pay attention to/help► you.”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.8.18" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.8.19"><sup id="1SA.8.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
But the people refused to pay attention to what Samuel said. They said, “We do not <span id="add-1SA.8.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">care what you say</span>! We want a king! <a href="#1SA.8.20"><sup id="1SA.8.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
We want to be like the other nations. We want a king to rule us and to lead our soldiers when they go to fight.”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.8.20" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.8.21"><sup id="1SA.8.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
When Samuel told Yahweh what the people had said, <a href="#1SA.8.22"><sup id="1SA.8.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
Yahweh replied, “Do what they are telling you to do. Give them a king!” <span id="add-1SA.8.22" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">So Samuel agreed</span>, and then he sent the people home.</p>
<a href="#1SA.9"><h3 id="1SA.9" class="usx-c">9</h3></a>
<p id="s1-1SA.9" class="usx-s1" >Saul met Samuel</p>
<p id="p-1SA.9" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.9.1"><sup id="1SA.9.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
There was a rich and influential man whose name was Kish. He belonged to the tribe descended from Benjamin. Kish was the son of Abiel and the grandson of Zeror. He was from the family of Becorath and from the clan of Aphiah. <a href="#1SA.9.2"><sup id="1SA.9.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
Kish had a son whose name was Saul. He was more handsome than any of the other Israeli men, and he was a head/foot taller than any of the other Israeli men.</p>
<p id="p-1SA.9.2" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.9.3"><sup id="1SA.9.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
One day, some of Kish’s female donkeys wandered off. So Kish told Saul, “Take one of my servants with you, and go and search for the donkeys!” <a href="#1SA.9.4"><sup id="1SA.9.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
So Saul did that. He took a servant, and they walked through the hilly area where the descendants of Ephraim lived, and then they went through the areas named Shalishah and Shaalim, and then they went through all the area where the descendants of Benjamin lived, but they could not find the donkeys.</p>
<p id="p-1SA.9.4" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.9.5"><sup id="1SA.9.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
Finally, they came to the area of Zuph. Then Saul said to the servant, “Let’s go back home. If we do not do that, my father will stop worrying about the donkeys and start worrying about us.”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.9.5" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.9.6"><sup id="1SA.9.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
But the servant said, “I have another idea [IDM]. There is one of God’s prophets who lives in this town. People respect him very much, because everything he predicts comes true. Let’s go <span id="add-1SA.9.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">talk</span> to him. Perhaps he can tell us where we can go <span id="add-1SA.9.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to find the donkeys</span>.”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.9.6" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.9.7"><sup id="1SA.9.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Saul replied to the servant, “If we go talk with him, <span id="add-1SA.9.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">we should give a gift to him, but</span> what can we give to him? We have no more food in our sacks. Do we have anything else to give to him?”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.9.7" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.9.8"><sup id="1SA.9.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
The servant replied, “Look <span id="add-1SA.9.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">at this</span>! I have a small silver coin. I can give this to him, and then he will tell us where to go <span id="add-1SA.9.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to find the donkeys</span>.” <a href="#1SA.9.9-11"><sup id="1SA.9.9-11" class="usx-v">9-11</sup></a>
Saul said, “Okay, let’s go <span id="add-1SA.9.9-11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">talk to him.”</span> So they went to the town where the prophet lived. As they were going up the hill into the town, they met some young women who were coming out of the town to get some water <span id="add-1SA.9.9-11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">from a well</span>. One of them asked the women, “Is the seer in the town <span id="add-1SA.9.9-11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">today</span>?” <span id="add-1SA.9.9-11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">They said that because</span> previously, if people <span id="add-1SA.9.9-11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in Israel</span> wanted a message from God, they would say, “Let’s go to the seer,” and people who now are called prophets were at that time called ‘those who see <span id="add-1SA.9.9-11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">◄visions from God/all that God sees►</span>.’ <a href="#1SA.9.12"><sup id="1SA.9.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>

He has just arrived in the town, because the people are going to offer a sacrifice on the altar where the people gather <span id="add-1SA.9.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to worship God</span>. <a href="#1SA.9.13"><sup id="1SA.9.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
If you go quickly, you will <span id="add-1SA.9.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">have time to talk to him</span> before he goes there.

    <a href="#1SA.9.14"><sup id="1SA.9.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
So Saul and the servant entered the town. As they went through the gates, they saw Samuel as he was coming toward them, on the way to where people were going to offer sacrifices.</p>

Saul saw Samuel as he was sitting at the town gateway <span id="add-1SA.9.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">but he did not know that it was Samuel</span>.

Samuel replied, “I am that man. Go ahead of me with your servant to the place where the people make sacrifices. Both of you will eat with me today.

Saul replied, “I am from the tribe of Benjamin [RHQ]. That is the smallest tribe in Israel [RHQ]! And my family is the least important family in our tribe! So why are you talking to me like this, <span id="add-1SA.9.21" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">about the Israeli people wanting me and my family</span>?”</p>

Then Samuel brought Saul and the servant into the big dining room, and told them to sit at the head <span id="add-1SA.9.22" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">of the table, indicating that he was</span> honoring them more than he was honoring the 30 people who had been invited. <a href="#1SA.9.23"><sup id="1SA.9.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>

So the cook brought the leg and the meat that was on it, and set it in front of Saul, <span id="add-1SA.9.24" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">even though those portions were for only the priest to eat</span>.

When Saul and his servant arrived at Gibeah, they saw some prophets who were <span id="add-1SA.10.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">speaking messages that came directly from God.

    <a href="#1SA.10.12"><sup id="1SA.10.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
One of the men who lived there replied, “<span id="add-1SA.10.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Saul cannot be a prophet, because</span> all prophets receive their power to speak messages from God, not from their parents.” And that is why, <span id="add-1SA.10.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">when people hear about a report of someone prophesying, they think about what happened to Saul and</span> say, “<span id="add-1SA.10.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">We are surprised about that person becoming a prophet, like</span> we were surprised to hear that Saul had really become one of the prophets.” <a href="#1SA.10.13"><sup id="1SA.10.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>

    <span id="add-1SA.10.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Later</span> Samuel summoned the people of Israel to gather at Mizpah to <span id="add-1SA.10.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">hear a message from</span> Yahweh. <a href="#1SA.10.18"><sup id="1SA.10.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
After they arrived, he said to them, “This is what Yahweh, the God we Israeli people <span id="add-1SA.10.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">worship</span>, says: I brought you Israeli people out of Egypt.

I am the one who saves you from all your troubles and difficulties. But today you have rejected me, your God, and you have said, ‘We don’t care!

    <a href="#1SA.10.20"><sup id="1SA.10.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
When those representatives came near to Samuel, <span id="add-1SA.10.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">God indicated that</span> he had chosen someone from the tribe descended from Benjamin. <a href="#1SA.10.21"><sup id="1SA.10.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
Then Samuel told representatives of the tribe of Benjamin to come forward, and God indicated that <span id="add-1SA.10.21" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">from that tribe</span> he had chosen someone from the family of Matri, and then God indicated that <span id="add-1SA.10.21" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">from the family of Matri</span> he had chosen Saul, the son of Kish. But when they looked for Saul, they could not find him. <a href="#1SA.10.22"><sup id="1SA.10.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
So they asked Yahweh, “Where is Saul?” Yahweh replied, “He is hiding among the army equipment.”</p>

So they quickly went there <span id="add-1SA.10.23" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and found him,</span> and brought him <span id="add-1SA.10.23" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in front of all the people</span>.

Then Samuel said to all the people there, “This is the man whom Yahweh has chosen to be your king. Among all us Israeli people, there is no one like him!” Then all the people shouted, “We hope that this king will live a long time!”</p>

    <a href="#1SA.10.25"><sup id="1SA.10.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
Then Samuel told the people what things the king would force them to do, and all the things the king was required to do. He wrote all those things on a scroll, and then he put it in a sacred place in the temple. Then Samuel sent all the people home.</p>

Jonathan <span id="add-1SA.13.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and the men who were with him</span> attacked the Philistine soldiers who were camped at Geba. The <span id="add-1SA.13.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">other</span> Philistines heard about that. <span id="add-1SA.13.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">So Saul realized that the army of Philistia would probably come to fight the Israelis again</span>.

The Philistines attacked the Israelis very strongly, and the Israeli soldiers realized that they were in a very bad situation.

Some of them crossed the Jordan River at a place where it was very shallow.

Saul <span id="add-1SA.14.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">realized that some of his soldiers must have attacked the Philistia army. So he </span> said to the soldiers who were with him, “Check to see if any of our men are not here.” So they checked, and they found out that Jonathan and the man who carried his weapons were gone.</p>
<p id="p-1SA.14.17" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.14.18"><sup id="1SA.14.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
So Saul said to Ahijah <span id="add-1SA.14.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the Supreme Priest</span>, “Bring the sacred vest here <span id="add-1SA.14.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and find out what we should do</span>.” On that day Ahijah was wearing the sacred vest, going in front of the Israelis. <a href="#1SA.14.19"><sup id="1SA.14.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
But while Saul was talking to the priest, <span id="add-1SA.14.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">he saw that</span> the Philistia soldiers were becoming more panicked/confused. So Saul said to Ahijah, “Take your hand down <span id="add-1SA.14.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">from the sacred vest. Do not waste any more time using the marked stones in the vest to find out what Yahweh wants us to do.”</span></p>
<p id="p-1SA.14.19" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.14.20"><sup id="1SA.14.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
Then Saul gathered his men and they went toward the battle. They found that the Philistia soldiers were so confused that they were striking each other with their swords. <a href="#1SA.14.21"><sup id="1SA.14.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
Before that, some of the Hebrew men had deserted their army and gone to join with the Philistia army. But now those men <span id="add-1SA.14.21" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">revolted and</span> joined with Saul and Jonathan and the other Israeli soldiers. <a href="#1SA.14.22"><sup id="1SA.14.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
Some of the Israeli soldiers had previously run away and hidden in the mountains where the tribe of Ephraim lived. But when they heard that the Philistia soldiers were running away, they <span id="add-1SA.14.22" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">came down and</span> joined the other Israeli soldiers and pursued the Philistia soldiers. <a href="#1SA.14.23"><sup id="1SA.14.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
So Yahweh rescued the Israelis on that day. The Israeli soldiers continued to pursue their enemies beyond Beth-Aven <span id="add-1SA.14.23" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">town</span>.</p>
<p id="s1-1SA.14.23" class="usx-s1" >The dispute about Jonathan eating honey</p>

    <a href="#1SA.14.24"><sup id="1SA.14.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
Before Saul’s soldiers went to the battle, Saul declared to them solemnly, “I do not want any of you to eat any food before this evening, before we have defeated all our enemies. If anyone eats anything, <span id="add-1SA.14.24" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Yahweh</span> will curse/punish him.” So none of the Israeli soldiers ate any food, and they became faint/weak because they were very hungry.</p>
<p id="p-1SA.14.24" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.14.25"><sup id="1SA.14.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
The Israeli army went into the forest, and they found honeycombs on the ground, but they did not eat any honey. <a href="#1SA.14.26"><sup id="1SA.14.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
They were afraid to eat any, because they had solemnly promised that they would not eat any food. <a href="#1SA.14.27"><sup id="1SA.14.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
But Jonathan did not hear what his father commanded <span id="add-1SA.14.27" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">because he had left the camp very early in the morning</span>. So <span id="add-1SA.14.27" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">when he saw</span> a honeycomb, he dipped the end of his walking stick into it and ate some honey.

<p id="p-1SA.14.27" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.14.28"><sup id="1SA.14.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
But one of the Israeli soldiers saw him and said to him, “Your father solemnly declared to us that <span id="add-1SA.14.28" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Yahweh</span> would curse/punish anyone who ate any food today. So now we are <span id="add-1SA.14.28" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">very tired and</span> weak from being hungry <span id="add-1SA.14.28" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">because we obeyed him</span>.” <a href="#1SA.14.29"><sup id="1SA.14.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>
Jonathan exclaimed, “My father has caused trouble for all of us! See how refreshed/strong I am after eating a little honey! <a href="#1SA.14.30"><sup id="1SA.14.30" class="usx-v">30</sup></a>
If he had permitted all of us to eat from the food we took from our enemies while we were pursuing them, we would have been able to kill many more of their soldiers!”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.14.30" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.14.31"><sup id="1SA.14.31" class="usx-v">31</sup></a>
The Israelis pursued and killed Philistia soldiers all that day, from Micmash <span id="add-1SA.14.31" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">town west</span> to Aijalon. But they continued to become weaker from being hungry. <a href="#1SA.14.32"><sup id="1SA.14.32" class="usx-v">32</sup></a>
They had taken <span id="add-1SA.14.32" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">many</span> sheep and cattle that the Philistia soldiers had abandoned. Now, because they were extremely hungry, they butchered some of those animals and ate the meat without draining the blood from the animals. <a href="#1SA.14.33"><sup id="1SA.14.33" class="usx-v">33</sup></a>
One of the soldiers told Saul, “Look! The men are sinning against Yahweh by eating meat that still has blood in it!”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.14.33" class="usx-p" >Saul replied <span id="add-1SA.14.33" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to the men who were near him</span>, “They have disobeyed Yahweh! Roll a large stone over here!”</p>

    <a href="#1SA.14.34"><sup id="1SA.14.34" class="usx-v">34</sup></a>
After they did that, he said to those men, “Go and tell all the soldiers that each of them must bring an ox or a sheep to me, and kill it here on this stone, <span id="add-1SA.14.34" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and drain the blood</span> before he eats any of the meat. They should not sin against Yahweh by eating meat <span id="add-1SA.14.34" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">from some animal</span> without draining its blood.” So that night all the soldiers brought animals and slaughtered them there. Then Saul built an altar to <span id="add-1SA.14.34" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">worship</span> Yahweh. <a href="#1SA.14.35"><sup id="1SA.14.35" class="usx-v">35</sup></a>
That was the first <span id="add-1SA.14.35" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">time that he built an</span> altar for Yahweh.</p>

Then Saul said <span id="add-1SA.14.36" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to the Israeli soldiers</span>, “Let’s pursue the Philistia soldiers tonight. We can attack them all night. We will not allow any of them to escape alive.”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.14.36" class="usx-p" >The Israeli soldiers answered, “We will do whatever you think is the best thing for us to do.”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.14.36" class="usx-p" >But the priest said, “We should ask Yahweh <span id="add-1SA.14.36" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">what he thinks we should do</span>.” <a href="#1SA.14.37"><sup id="1SA.14.37" class="usx-v">37</sup></a>
So Saul asked God, “Should we pursue the Philistine soldiers? Will you enable us to defeat them?” But God did not answer Saul that day.</p>
<p id="p-1SA.14.37" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.14.38"><sup id="1SA.14.38" class="usx-v">38</sup></a>
Then Saul summoned all the leaders of his army. He said to them, “<span id="add-1SA.14.38" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">I am sure that God has not answered me because</span> someone has sinned.

Yahweh has rescued us <span id="add-1SA.14.39" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">from the Philistia army</span>. Just as certain as Yahweh lives, whoever has sinned must be executed. Even if it is my son Jonathan who has sinned, he must be executed.”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.14.39" class="usx-p" >
    <span id="add-1SA.14.39" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">His men knew who was guilty</span>, but none of them said anything <span id="add-1SA.14.39" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to Saul</span>. <a href="#1SA.14.40"><sup id="1SA.14.40" class="usx-v">40</sup></a>
Then Saul said to all the Israeli soldiers, “You stand on one side. My son Jonathan and I will stand on the other side.”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.14.40" class="usx-p" >His men replied, “Do whatever you think is best.” <a href="#1SA.14.41"><sup id="1SA.14.41" class="usx-v">41</sup></a>
Then Saul prayed to Yahweh, the Israelis’ God, “Tell me who is guilty and who is not guilty.” Then the priest ◄cast lots/threw the stones that were marked►, and they indicated that it was <span id="add-1SA.14.41" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">either</span> Jonathan or Saul who was the guilty one, and that the other men were not guilty. <a href="#1SA.14.42"><sup id="1SA.14.42" class="usx-v">42</sup></a>
Then Saul said to the priest, “Throw the stones again to indicate which of us two is guilty.” So he did, and the stones indicated that Jonathan was the guilty one.</p>

    <a href="#1SA.14.43"><sup id="1SA.14.43" class="usx-v">43</sup></a>
Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done <span id="add-1SA.14.43" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that was wrong</span>.”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.14.43" class="usx-p" >Jonathan replied, “I ate a little bit of honey. It was only a little bit that was on the end of my stick.

    <a href="#1SA.14.45"><sup id="1SA.14.45" class="usx-v">45</sup></a>
But the Israeli soldiers said to Saul, “Jonathan has won a great victory for all us Israelis. Should he be executed for eating some honey [RHQ]? Certainly not! Just as surely as Yahweh lives, we will not allow you to injure him in any manner [IDM], <span id="add-1SA.14.45" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">because</span> today God helped Jonathan <span id="add-1SA.14.45" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to kill many soldiers of the Philistia army</span>!”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.14.45" class="usx-p" >So <span id="add-1SA.14.45" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">by saying that</span> the Israeli soldiers rescued Jonathan, and he was not executed. <a href="#1SA.14.46"><sup id="1SA.14.46" class="usx-v">46</sup></a>

Saul’s army fought bravely and defeated the <span id="add-1SA.14.48" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">very tall</span> descendants of Amalek. His army rescued the Israelis from those who had ◄plundered/forcefully taken things from► them.</p>

Samuel said, “Previously you did not think that you were important. But now you have become [RHQ] the leader of the tribes of Israel. Yahweh appointed you to be their king. <a href="#1SA.15.18"><sup id="1SA.15.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>

My men brought back only the best sheep and cattle and other things, in order to sacrifice them to Yahweh your God here at Gilgal.”</p>

To rebel <span id="add-1SA.15.23" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">against God</span> is as sinful as doing sorcery/black magic,</p>

    <a href="#1SA.15.24"><sup id="1SA.15.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
Then Saul said to Samuel, “<span id="add-1SA.15.24" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Yes</span>, I have sinned.

But Samuel replied, “No, I will not go back with you. You have rejected/disobeyed what Yahweh commanded you to do.

As Samuel turned to leave, Saul tried to stop him by grabbing the edge of Samuel’s robe, and it tore. <a href="#1SA.15.28"><sup id="1SA.15.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
Samuel said to him, “<span id="add-1SA.15.28" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">You tore my robe!

And since the one who is the glorious <span id="add-1SA.15.29" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">God</span> of the Israeli people does not lie, he will not change ◄his mind/what he has said►.

    <a href="#1SA.15.30"><sup id="1SA.15.30" class="usx-v">30</sup></a>
Then Saul <span id="add-1SA.15.30" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">pleaded again. He</span> said, “I know that I have sinned.

So Samuel finally agreed to do that, and they went together back <span id="add-1SA.15.31" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to where the people were</span>, and Saul worshiped Yahweh there.</p>

Then Samuel said, “Bring King Agag to me.” So they brought Agag to him. Agag was confidently expecting that they would spare him/not kill him. He was thinking, “Surely I will not have to endure an agonizing death!”</p>

    <a href="#1SA.15.34"><sup id="1SA.15.34" class="usx-v">34</sup></a>
Then Samuel left there and returned to his home in Ramah, and Saul went to his home in Gibeah. <a href="#1SA.15.35"><sup id="1SA.15.35" class="usx-v">35</sup></a>
Samuel never saw Saul again, but he was very sad about <span id="add-1SA.15.35" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">what</span> Saul <span id="add-1SA.15.35" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">had done</span>.

Finally, Yahweh said to Samuel, “I have decided that I will not allow Saul to continue to be the king.

But Samuel said, “I am afraid [RHQ] to do that!

“Invite Jesse to come to the sacrifice. <span id="add-1SA.16.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">When he comes,</span> I will show you what you should do.

<p id="p-1SA.16.3" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.16.4"><sup id="1SA.16.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
Samuel did what Yahweh told him to do. He went to Bethlehem. When the town leaders came to him, they trembled, <span id="add-1SA.16.4" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">because they were worried that Samuel had come to rebuke them about something</span>. One of them asked him, “Have you come <span id="add-1SA.16.4" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to speak</span> peacefully <span id="add-1SA.16.4" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to us</span>?”</p>

When they arrived there, Samuel looked at <span id="add-1SA.16.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Jesse’s oldest son</span> Eliab, and thought, “Surely this is the one whom Yahweh has appointed <span id="add-1SA.16.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to be king</span>!”</p>

    <a href="#1SA.16.7"><sup id="1SA.16.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
But Yahweh said to Samuel, “No, he is not the one whom I have chosen. Don’t pay attention to his being handsome and very tall, because I have not chosen him. I do not evaluate people as people do.

    <a href="#1SA.16.8"><sup id="1SA.16.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
Then Jesse told <span id="add-1SA.16.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">his next oldest son</span> Abinadab to step forward and walk in front of Samuel. <span id="add-1SA.16.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">But when he did that</span>, Samuel said, “Yahweh has not chosen this one, either.” <a href="#1SA.16.9"><sup id="1SA.16.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
Then Jesse told <span id="add-1SA.16.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">his next oldest son</span> Shammah to step forward.

Similarly, Jesse told his other four sons to walk in front of Samuel. But Samuel said to Jesse, “Yahweh has not chosen any of these sons of yours.” <a href="#1SA.16.11"><sup id="1SA.16.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
Then Samuel asked Jesse, “Do you have any other sons?” Jesse replied, “My youngest son <span id="add-1SA.16.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">is not here</span>; he is out <span id="add-1SA.16.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in the fields</span> taking care of the sheep.” Samuel said, “Send someone to bring him here!

    <a href="#1SA.16.12"><sup id="1SA.16.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
So Jesse sent <span id="add-1SA.16.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">someone</span> to bring <span id="add-1SA.16.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">David there. And when David arrived, Samuel saw that</span> he was handsome and healthy, and had bright eyes. Then Yahweh said, “This is the one <span id="add-1SA.16.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">whom I have chosen</span>; anoint him <span id="add-1SA.16.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to be king</span>.”</p>

    <a href="#1SA.16.13"><sup id="1SA.16.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
So as David <span id="add-1SA.16.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">stood there</span> in front of his older brothers, Samuel took the container of oil that he had brought and poured some of it on David’s head <span id="add-1SA.16.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to set him apart to serve God. After they all ate, Samuel left </span> and returned to Ramah. But Yahweh’s Spirit came on David powerfully, and stayed with David for the rest of his life.</p>

But Yahweh’s Spirit left Saul.

    <a href="#1SA.16.15"><sup id="1SA.16.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>

So <span id="add-1SA.16.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">we suggest that you</span> allow us, your servants here, to search for a man who plays the harp well.

One of his servants said to him, “A man named Jesse, in Bethlehem <span id="add-1SA.16.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">town</span>, has a son who plays the harp very well.

    <a href="#1SA.16.19"><sup id="1SA.16.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>

Then David went to Saul and started to work for him.

He wore a helmet made of bronze <span id="add-1SA.17.5" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to protect his head</span>, and he wore a coat made of metal plates <span id="add-1SA.17.5" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to protect his body</span>.

He wore bronze guards/protectors on his legs. He had a long bronze dagger fastened on his back. <a href="#1SA.17.7"><sup id="1SA.17.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
He also had a big spear. It had a cord on it to enable him to throw it better (OR, which was as thick as a weaver’s beam). The tip of the spear was made of iron and weighed ◄15 pounds/almost 7 kg.►. A soldier carrying a huge shield walked in front of him.</p>

Goliath stood there and shouted to the Israeli army, “Why are you all lined up for battle?

David was the son of Jesse. Jesse was from the clan of Ephrath. He lived in Bethlehem, in the area where the descendants of Judah lived. Jesse had eight sons. When Saul <span id="add-1SA.17.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">was king</span>, Jesse had already become a very old man [DOU]. <a href="#1SA.17.13"><sup id="1SA.17.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Jesse’s three oldest sons, Eliab and Abinadab and Shammah, had gone with Saul to fight <span id="add-1SA.17.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the Philistines</span>. <a href="#1SA.17.14"><sup id="1SA.17.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
David was Jesse’s youngest son. While his three oldest brothers were with Saul, <a href="#1SA.17.15"><sup id="1SA.17.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
David went back and forth: Sometimes he went to Saul’s camp, and sometimes he stayed in Bethlehem to take care of his father’s sheep.</p>

For 40 days Goliath came out from the Philistine camp and stood there <span id="add-1SA.17.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">taunting the Israeli army/telling the Israelis to choose one man to fight with him</span>.

    <span id="add-1SA.17.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">One day</span>, Jesse said to David, “Here is a sack of roasted grain and ten loaves of bread.

His brothers were with Saul and all the other Israeli soldiers, camped alongside Elah Valley, <span id="add-1SA.17.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">preparing to</span> fight the Philistines. <a href="#1SA.17.20"><sup id="1SA.17.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
So David arranged for another shepherd to take care of the sheep. Early the next morning he took the food and went to the Israeli camp, as Jesse told him to do. He arrived there just as the Israeli soldiers were forming their ranks and going out to the battlefield. As they went, they were shouting a war cry. <a href="#1SA.17.21"><sup id="1SA.17.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
The Philistine army and the Israeli army stood <span id="add-1SA.17.21" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">on the hillsides</span>, facing each other, ready for the battle. <a href="#1SA.17.22"><sup id="1SA.17.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
David gave the food to the man who was taking care of the war equipment. <span id="add-1SA.17.22" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">He told him to take care of the food that he brought</span>, and then he went and greeted his older brothers. <a href="#1SA.17.23"><sup id="1SA.17.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
While he was talking with them, he saw Goliath coming out from among the Philistine soldiers, shouting <span id="add-1SA.17.23" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to the Israelis</span>, challenging them <span id="add-1SA.17.23" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to send a man to fight him</span>. David heard what Goliath was saying. <a href="#1SA.17.24"><sup id="1SA.17.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
When all the Israeli soldiers saw Goliath, they were terrified and started to ran away. <a href="#1SA.17.25"><sup id="1SA.17.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
They were saying to each other, “Look at him coming up toward us! And listen to him as he defies us Israelis! The king says that he will give a big reward to whoever kills this man. He also says that he will give his daughter to that man for him to marry her, and that he will no longer require that man’s family to pay taxes.”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.17.25" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.17.26"><sup id="1SA.17.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
David talked to some of the men who were standing near him. He said, “What will be given to whoever kills this Philistine and frees us Israelis from this shame/disgrace? And who <span id="add-1SA.17.26" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">does </span> this heathen Philistine <span id="add-1SA.17.26" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">think he</span> is, defying/ridiculing the army that serves the all-powerful God?”</p>

    <a href="#1SA.17.27"><sup id="1SA.17.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
They told him the same thing that the other men had said, about what the king would do for anyone who killed Goliath.</p>
<p id="p-1SA.17.27" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.17.28"><sup id="1SA.17.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
But when David’s oldest brother Eliab heard David talking to the men, he was angry. He said to David, “Why have you come down here? Is someone taking care of those few sheep that you left in the desert? I know you are just a ◄smart-aleck/brat►! You just want to watch the battle!”</p>

    <a href="#1SA.17.29"><sup id="1SA.17.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>
David replied, “Have I done something wrong? I was merely asking a question!” <a href="#1SA.17.30"><sup id="1SA.17.30" class="usx-v">30</sup></a>
Then he walked over to another man and asked him the same question, but the man gave him the same answer. Each time he asked someone, he received the same answer. <a href="#1SA.17.31"><sup id="1SA.17.31" class="usx-v">31</sup></a>
Finally, someone told king Saul what David had asked, and Saul sent someone to bring David to him.</p>

    <a href="#1SA.17.32"><sup id="1SA.17.32" class="usx-v">32</sup></a>
David told king Saul, “No one should ◄worry/become a coward► because of that Philistine man. I will go and fight with him!”</p>

    <a href="#1SA.17.33"><sup id="1SA.17.33" class="usx-v">33</sup></a>
Saul said to David, “You are only a young man, and he has been a very capable soldier all his life. So you are not able to go and fight with him!”</p>

    <a href="#1SA.17.34"><sup id="1SA.17.34" class="usx-v">34</sup></a>
David replied, “I have been taking care of my father’s sheep <span id="add-1SA.17.34" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">for many years</span>. Whenever a lion or a bear came and carried away a lamb, <a href="#1SA.17.35"><sup id="1SA.17.35" class="usx-v">35</sup></a>
I went after the lion or the bear and attacked it and rescued the lamb from the wild animal’s mouth. Then I grabbed the animal by its jaw/throat and struck it and killed it. <a href="#1SA.17.36"><sup id="1SA.17.36" class="usx-v">36</sup></a>
I have killed both lions and bears.

Yahweh has rescued me from paws of lions and bears, and he will rescue me from this Philistine!” Then Saul said to David, “All right, go <span id="add-1SA.17.37" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and fight him</span>, and <span id="add-1SA.17.37" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">I hope/desire</span> that Yahweh will help you!”</p>

    <a href="#1SA.17.38"><sup id="1SA.17.38" class="usx-v">38</sup></a>
Then Saul gave to David his own clothes that he always wore in battles, and he gave him a bronze helmet and a coat made of metal plates. <a href="#1SA.17.39"><sup id="1SA.17.39" class="usx-v">39</sup></a>
David <span id="add-1SA.17.39" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">put these things on. Then he</span> fastened his sword over them, and tried to walk. But he could not walk, because he was not accustomed to wearing those things. So David said to Saul, “I cannot fight wearing all these things, because I am not accustomed to <span id="add-1SA.17.39" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">wearing</span> them!” So he took them off.</p>

Then he took his walking/shepherd’s stick, and he picked up five smooth stones from the brook/stream. He put them in the pouch of his shoulder-bag. Then he put his sling in his hand and started walking toward Goliath.</p>

Goliath walked toward David, with the soldier who was carrying his shield walking in front of him. When he got near David, <a href="#1SA.17.42"><sup id="1SA.17.42" class="usx-v">42</sup></a>
he looked at David closely. He saw that David had a handsome face and healthy body, but that he was only a young man. So he sneered at David. <a href="#1SA.17.43"><sup id="1SA.17.43" class="usx-v">43</sup></a>

    <a href="#1SA.17.45"><sup id="1SA.17.45" class="usx-v">45</sup></a>
David replied, “You are coming to me with a sword and a dagger and a spear. But I am coming to you ◄in the name/with the authority► of almighty Yahweh.

As Goliath came closer to attack David, David ran quickly toward him. <a href="#1SA.17.49"><sup id="1SA.17.49" class="usx-v">49</sup></a>
He put his hand into his shoulder-bag and took out one stone.

Then David ran and stood over Goliath. He pulled Goliath’s sword from its sheath and killed him with it, and then cut off his head.

David later took the head of Goliath to Jerusalem, but he kept Goliath’s weapons in his own tent.</p>

From that time, Saul watched David very closely because he was suspicious <span id="add-1SA.18.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that David would try to become king</span>.</p>
<p id="p-1SA.18.9" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.18.10"><sup id="1SA.18.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
The next day, an evil spirit sent by God suddenly took control of Saul. He began to act like a madman, inside his house. David was playing the lyre for him, as he did every day. Saul was holding a spear in his hand, <a href="#1SA.18.11"><sup id="1SA.18.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
and he hurled it <span id="add-1SA.18.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">at David</span>, saying to himself, “I will fasten David to the wall with the spear!” He did that two times, but David jumped aside <span id="add-1SA.18.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">both times</span>.</p>
<p id="p-1SA.18.11" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.18.12"><sup id="1SA.18.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
Because <span id="add-1SA.18.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">it became evident that</span> Yahweh had abandoned Saul but <span id="add-1SA.18.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that</span> he was helping David, Saul was afraid of David. <a href="#1SA.18.13"><sup id="1SA.18.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
So he appointed David as a commander of 1,000 soldiers and sent David away from him, <span id="add-1SA.18.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">hoping that David would be killed in a battle</span>. But when David led his soldiers <span id="add-1SA.18.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in their battles</span>, <a href="#1SA.18.14"><sup id="1SA.18.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
he always had great success, because Yahweh was helping him. <a href="#1SA.18.15"><sup id="1SA.18.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
When Saul heard that David <span id="add-1SA.18.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and his soldiers were</span> very successful, he became more afraid of David. <a href="#1SA.18.16"><sup id="1SA.18.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
But all the people of Israel and of Judah loved David, because he led the soldiers very successfully <span id="add-1SA.18.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in the battles</span>.</p>
<p id="s1-1SA.18.16" class="usx-s1" >David married Saul’s daughter</p>

    <a href="#1SA.18.17"><sup id="1SA.18.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
One day Saul said to David, “I am ready to give you my oldest daughter, Merab, to be your wife. I will do that if you serve me bravely by fighting battles for Yahweh <span id="add-1SA.18.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">against the Philistines</span>”. He said that because he thought, “I will not try to get rid of David by myself. I will allow the Philistines to do that.”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.18.17" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.18.18"><sup id="1SA.18.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
But David said to Saul, “I am not [RHQ] a very important person, and my family is not very important, and my clan is not a very important Israeli clan. So I do not deserve to become your son-in-law.” [RHQ] <a href="#1SA.18.19"><sup id="1SA.18.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
So, when it was time for Merab to be given to David to become his wife, instead, Saul gave her to a man named Adriel, from Meholah <span id="add-1SA.18.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">town</span>.</p>
<p id="p-1SA.18.19" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.18.20"><sup id="1SA.18.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
But Saul’s other daughter, Michal, fell in love with David. When they told Saul about that, he was pleased. <a href="#1SA.18.21"><sup id="1SA.18.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
He thought, “I will let Michal marry him, in order that she may trap him, and the Philistines will be able to kill him.” So he said to David, <span id="add-1SA.18.21" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">“You can marry Michal</span>,” and by saying that, he indicated for the second time that David would become his son-in-law.</p>
<p id="p-1SA.18.21" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.18.22"><sup id="1SA.18.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
Saul told his servants, “Talk to David privately, and say to him, ‘Listen, the king is pleased with you, and all of us his servants love you. So now <span id="add-1SA.18.22" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">we think that</span> you should <span id="add-1SA.18.22" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">marry Michal and</span> become the king’s son-in-law.’&#160;”</p>

    <a href="#1SA.18.23"><sup id="1SA.18.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
So they told that to David. But David said, “It would be a great honor [RHQ] to become the king’s son-in-law. But <span id="add-1SA.18.23" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">I do not think that I should do that, because</span> I am only a poor and insignificant man.”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.18.23" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.18.24"><sup id="1SA.18.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
When the servants told Saul what David had said, <a href="#1SA.18.25"><sup id="1SA.18.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
Saul replied, “Go and say to David, ‘<span id="add-1SA.18.25" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">In order for </span> the king <span id="add-1SA.18.25" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to allow you to marry Michal, he</span> wants <span id="add-1SA.18.25" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">you to kill</span> 100 Philistines <span id="add-1SA.18.25" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and cut off</span> their foreskins <span id="add-1SA.18.25" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and bring the foreskins to him to prove that you have killed them</span>. In that way he will get revenge on his enemies.’&#160;” But what Saul wanted was that the Philistines would kill David <span id="add-1SA.18.25" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">while David was trying to kill them</span>.</p>
<p id="p-1SA.18.25" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.18.26"><sup id="1SA.18.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
When the servants told that to David, he was very pleased that he could become the king’s son-in-law <span id="add-1SA.18.26" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">by doing that. The king had said how many days he would allow for David to do that</span>. But before that time ended, <a href="#1SA.18.27"><sup id="1SA.18.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
David and his men went and killed, <span id="add-1SA.18.27" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">not 100, but</span> 200 Philistines! He brought their foreskins to Saul, and counted them <span id="add-1SA.18.27" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">while Saul was watching</span>, in order to prove that he had <span id="add-1SA.18.27" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">done what the king required so that he could become Saul’s son-in-law. So then Saul was obligated</span> to allow David to marry his daughter Michal.</p>
<p id="p-1SA.18.27" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.18.28"><sup id="1SA.18.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
But when Saul realized that Yahweh was helping David, and that his daughter loved David, <a href="#1SA.18.29"><sup id="1SA.18.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>
he became more afraid of David. So, as long as Saul lived, he was David’s enemy.</p>

    <a href="#1SA.18.30"><sup id="1SA.18.30" class="usx-v">30</sup></a>
The Philistine armies repeatedly came to fight the Israelis, but every time they fought, David and his soldiers were more successful than any of Saul’s other army commanders. As a result, David became very famous.</p>

Then Saul urged all his servants and his son Jonathan to kill David. But Jonathan liked David very much. <a href="#1SA.19.2"><sup id="1SA.19.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
So he warned David, “My father Saul is seeking for a way to kill you. So be careful.

    <span id="add-1SA.19.4" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">The next morning</span>, Jonathan spoke with his father, saying many good things about David.

Saul listened to what Jonathan said. Then Saul said, “I solemnly promise that just as certain as Yahweh lives, I will not kill David.”</p>

David replied, “Tomorrow we will celebrate the Festival of the New Moon. I always eat with the king at that festival. But tomorrow I will hide in the field, and I will stay there for one night. I will stay there until the evening of the day after tomorrow. <a href="#1SA.20.6"><sup id="1SA.20.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
If your father asks why I am not there at the festival, say to him, ‘David requested me to allow him to go to his home in Bethlehem, where his family will offer the sacrifice that they offer <span id="add-1SA.20.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">during this festival</span> every year.’ <a href="#1SA.20.7"><sup id="1SA.20.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
If your father says ‘That is okay’, then I know I will be safe. But if he becomes extremely angry, you will know that he is determined to harm me. <a href="#1SA.20.8"><sup id="1SA.20.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
Please be kind to me. Yahweh heard you when you made a solemn agreement with me <span id="add-1SA.20.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that you and I will always be loyal friends</span>. If I deserve to be punished [MTY], kill me yourself. I do not want [RHQ] you to allow your father to punish [IDM] me.”</p>

    <a href="#1SA.20.9"><sup id="1SA.20.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
Jonathan replied, “I will never do that! But if I find out that my father is determined to harm/kill you, I will certainly warn you.” [RHQ]</p>

    <a href="#1SA.20.10"><sup id="1SA.20.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
David asked him, “How will I find out if your father answers you harshly?” <a href="#1SA.20.11"><sup id="1SA.20.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
Jonathan replied, “Come with me. We will go out into the field.” So they went together out into the field.</p>
<p id="p-1SA.20.11" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.20.12"><sup id="1SA.20.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
There Jonathan said to David, “I promise this while Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis <span id="add-1SA.20.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">worship</span>, is listening: At this time the day after tomorrow, I will find out what my father <span id="add-1SA.20.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">is thinking about you</span>. If he is saying good things about you, I will certainly send a message to you to tell that to you [RHQ]. <a href="#1SA.20.13"><sup id="1SA.20.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
But if he is planning to hurt/kill you, I will enable you to know [IDM] that, and enable you to go away safely. I desire that Yahweh will punish me severely if I do not do that <span id="add-1SA.20.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">for you</span>. I desire/hope that Yahweh will be with you <span id="add-1SA.20.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and help you</span> like he has helped my father. <a href="#1SA.20.14"><sup id="1SA.20.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
But while I am still alive, please be kind to me in the same way that Yahweh is kind to me, and do not kill me <span id="add-1SA.20.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">when you become king</span>. <a href="#1SA.20.15"><sup id="1SA.20.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>

    <a href="#1SA.20.16"><sup id="1SA.20.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>

    <span id="add-1SA.20.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">David agreed</span>. So Jonathan made a solemn agreement with David. And he said, “I hope/desire that Yahweh will get rid of all your enemies.” <a href="#1SA.20.17"><sup id="1SA.20.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
And Jonathan requested David to repeat his solemn promise to be his close friend, because Jonathan loved David as much as he loved himself.</p>
<p id="p-1SA.20.17" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.20.18"><sup id="1SA.20.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
Then Jonathan said, “Tomorrow we will celebrate the Festival of the New Moon. When you are not sitting at your place when we eat, my father will ◄miss you/see that you are not there►. <a href="#1SA.20.19"><sup id="1SA.20.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
The day after tomorrow, in the evening, go to the place where you hid before. Wait by the pile of stones. <a href="#1SA.20.20"><sup id="1SA.20.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
I will come out and shoot three arrows as though I were trying to shoot at a target. <span id="add-1SA.20.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">The arrows will hit the ground</span> close to the pile of stones. <a href="#1SA.20.21"><sup id="1SA.20.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
Then I will send a boy to bring the arrows back to me. If you hear me say to him, ‘They are closer to me’, then as surely as Yahweh lives, you will know that everything is fine, <span id="add-1SA.20.21" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and that Saul will not kill you</span>. <a href="#1SA.20.22"><sup id="1SA.20.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
But if I tell him, ‘The arrows are farther away’, you will know that you must leave immediately, because Yahweh wants you to run away. <a href="#1SA.20.23"><sup id="1SA.20.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
I hope/desire that Yahweh will watch you and me and enable us to never forget what we have promised each other.”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.20.23" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.20.24"><sup id="1SA.20.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
So David went and hid in the field. When the Festival of the New Moon started, the king sat down to eat. <a href="#1SA.20.25"><sup id="1SA.20.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
He sat where he usually sat, close to the wall. Jonathan sat across from him, and Abner <span id="add-1SA.20.25" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the army commander</span> sat next to Saul. But no one was sitting in the place where David <span id="add-1SA.20.25" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">usually sat</span>. <a href="#1SA.20.26"><sup id="1SA.20.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
On that day, Saul did not say anything about David, because he was thinking, “Something must have happened that caused David to become unacceptable <span id="add-1SA.20.26" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to worship God</span>.” <a href="#1SA.20.27"><sup id="1SA.20.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
But the next day, when David was not sitting at the place where he usually sat, Saul asked Jonathan, “Why has that son of Jesse not been here to eat with us yesterday and today?”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.20.27" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.20.28"><sup id="1SA.20.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
Jonathan replied, “David earnestly requested me that I permit him to go to Bethlehem. <a href="#1SA.20.29"><sup id="1SA.20.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>
He said, ‘Please allow me to go, because our family is going to offer a sacrifice. My <span id="add-1SA.20.29" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">older</span> brother insisted that I be there. So please allow me to go to be with my <span id="add-1SA.20.29" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">older</span> brothers.’ <span id="add-1SA.20.29" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">I allowed David to go</span>, and that is the reason that he is not here eating with you.”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.20.29" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.20.30"><sup id="1SA.20.30" class="usx-v">30</sup></a>
Saul was ◄furious/very angry► with Jonathan. He yelled at him, “You stupid bastard [EUP]! I know that you are being loyal to that son of Jesse. By doing that, you will bring shame to yourself and to your mother. <a href="#1SA.20.31"><sup id="1SA.20.31" class="usx-v">31</sup></a>
As long as Jesse’s son is living, you will never become the king, and you will never rule over a kingdom! So now, summon David, and bring him to me. He must be executed!”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.20.31" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.20.32"><sup id="1SA.20.32" class="usx-v">32</sup></a>
Jonathan asked his father, “Why should David be executed? What wrong has he done?” <a href="#1SA.20.33"><sup id="1SA.20.33" class="usx-v">33</sup></a>
Then Saul threw his spear at Jonathan in order to kill him, <span id="add-1SA.20.33" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">but the spear did not hit him</span>. So Jonathan knew that his father really wanted to kill David.</p>
<p id="p-1SA.20.33" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.20.34"><sup id="1SA.20.34" class="usx-v">34</sup></a>
Jonathan was very angry, and he left the room. On that second day of the festival, he refused to eat anything. He was disgusted about what his father had done, and he was worried about David.</p>
<p id="p-1SA.20.34" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.20.35"><sup id="1SA.20.35" class="usx-v">35</sup></a>
The following morning Jonathan went out to the field to give a message to David, like he had agreed that he would do. He took a young boy with him. <a href="#1SA.20.36"><sup id="1SA.20.36" class="usx-v">36</sup></a>
Jonathan said to the boy, “Run and find the arrows that I shoot.” The boy started running, and Jonathan shot an arrow ahead of the boy. <a href="#1SA.20.37"><sup id="1SA.20.37" class="usx-v">37</sup></a>
When the boy ran to the place where the arrow hit the ground, Jonathan called out, “The arrow is further away!” [RHQ] <a href="#1SA.20.38"><sup id="1SA.20.38" class="usx-v">38</sup></a>
Then he shouted to the boy, “Act quickly; do not wait! Do not stop!” The boy picked up the arrow and brought it back to Jonathan. <a href="#1SA.20.39"><sup id="1SA.20.39" class="usx-v">39</sup></a>
But the boy did not understand the meaning of what Jonathan had said; only Jonathan and David knew. <a href="#1SA.20.40"><sup id="1SA.20.40" class="usx-v">40</sup></a>
Then Jonathan gave his bow and arrows to the boy and told him, “Go back to the town.”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.20.40" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.20.41"><sup id="1SA.20.41" class="usx-v">41</sup></a>
When the boy left, David came out from the south side of the pile of stones behind which he had been hiding. He went to Jonathan and bowed <span id="add-1SA.20.41" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in front of Jonathan</span> three times, with his face touching the ground. Then David and Jonathan kissed each other <span id="add-1SA.20.41" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">on the cheek/neck</span>, and they cried together. But David cried more than Jonathan.</p>
<p id="p-1SA.20.41" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.20.42"><sup id="1SA.20.42" class="usx-v">42</sup></a>
Jonathan said to David, “May things go well for you as you go. Yahweh has heard what we solemnly promised to always do for each other, and what we said that our descendants must do for each other.” Then David left, and Jonathan went back to the town.</p>
<a href="#1SA.21"><h3 id="1SA.21" class="usx-c">21</h3></a>

David fled from there and went to Nob <span id="add-1SA.21.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">city to see</span> Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech trembled when he saw David <span id="add-1SA.21.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">because he was afraid that something bad had happened</span>.

David <span id="add-1SA.21.2" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">deceived Ahimelech</span> by replying, “The king sent me.

The priest answered David, “There is no ordinary bread here, but I have some of the sacred bread <span id="add-1SA.21.4" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that was placed before Yahweh</span>. Your men may eat it if they have not slept with [EUP] women <span id="add-1SA.21.4" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">recently</span>.”</p>

    <a href="#1SA.21.5"><sup id="1SA.21.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
David replied, “They have not been near women for many days. I do not allow my men to defile themselves by sleeping with women while they are preparing to fight in battles. They must continue to keep themselves acceptable to God when they are on ordinary trips, and <span id="add-1SA.21.5" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">today they have kept themselves acceptable to God</span> because now we are doing something very special/important.” <a href="#1SA.21.6"><sup id="1SA.21.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
The only bread that the priest had was the sacred bread that had been placed in Yahweh’s presence <span id="add-1SA.21.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in the Sacred tent</span>. So the priest gave David some of that bread. On that day the priest had taken those loaves from the table and replaced them with ◄fresh/newly baked► loaves.</p>

One day <span id="add-1SA.26.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">some of</span> the people of Ziph <span id="add-1SA.26.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">town</span> went to Saul while he was at Gibeah, and they said to him, “David is hiding in a cave on Hakilah hill, across from Jeshimon <span id="add-1SA.26.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">town</span>.”</p>

    <a href="#1SA.26.2"><sup id="1SA.26.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
So Saul chose 3,000 of the best Israeli soldiers and went with them to Ziph Desert to search for David. <a href="#1SA.26.3"><sup id="1SA.26.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
Saul and his men set up their tents close to the road on Hakilah hill, east of Jeshimon <span id="add-1SA.26.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">town</span>, but David <span id="add-1SA.26.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and his men</span> stayed in the desert. When David heard that Saul was searching for him, <a href="#1SA.26.4"><sup id="1SA.26.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
he sent some spies to find out for certain that Saul had come to Hakilah.</p>
<p id="p-1SA.26.4" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.26.5"><sup id="1SA.26.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
Then <span id="add-1SA.26.5" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that evening</span> David went to the place where Saul had set up his tent. <span id="add-1SA.26.5" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">From a distance</span> he saw where Saul and his army commander, Abner, were sleeping. Saul was sleeping with all his army <span id="add-1SA.26.5" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">sleeping</span> around him.</p>
<p id="p-1SA.26.5" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.26.6"><sup id="1SA.26.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
David <span id="add-1SA.26.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">went back to where his men were and</span> talked to Ahimelech, who was from the Heth people-group, and Joab’s brother Abishai, whose mother was <span id="add-1SA.26.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">David’s older sister</span> Zeruiah. He asked them, “Who will go with me down into the camp where Saul is?”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.26.6" class="usx-p" >Abishai replied, “I will go with you.” <a href="#1SA.26.7"><sup id="1SA.26.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
So that night David and Abishai crept into Saul’s camp. They saw that Saul was asleep. His spear was stuck in the ground near his head. Saul was asleep in the middle of the camp. Abner <span id="add-1SA.26.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the army commander</span> and the other soldiers were sleeping around Saul.</p>
<p id="p-1SA.26.7" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.26.8"><sup id="1SA.26.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
Abishai whispered to David, “Today Yahweh has enabled us to kill your enemy! Allow me to fasten Saul to the ground <span id="add-1SA.26.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">by thrusting</span> my spear into him. It will be necessary for me to strike him only once. I will not <span id="add-1SA.26.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">need to</span> strike him twice.”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.26.8" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.26.9"><sup id="1SA.26.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
But David whispered to Abishai, “No, do not kill Saul. Yahweh has appointed him to be king, so Yahweh will surely [RHQ] punish anyone who kills him. <a href="#1SA.26.10"><sup id="1SA.26.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
Just as surely as Yahweh lives, he himself will punish Saul. Perhaps Yahweh will strike him when it is Saul’s time to die, or perhaps Saul will be killed in a battle. <a href="#1SA.26.11"><sup id="1SA.26.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
But I hope/desire that Yahweh will prevent me from harming the king whom he has appointed. Let’s take Saul’s spear and water jug that are near his head. Then let’s get out of here!”</p>
<p id="s1-1SA.26.11" class="usx-s1" >David taunted Abner and Saul</p>

    <a href="#1SA.26.12"><sup id="1SA.26.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
So David took the spear and the jug, and he and Abishai left. No one saw them or knew what they were doing, and no one woke up, because Yahweh had caused them to be sound asleep.</p>
<p id="p-1SA.26.12" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.26.13"><sup id="1SA.26.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
David and Abishai went across the valley and climbed to the top of the hill, a long way from Saul’s camp.</p>

    <a href="#1SA.26.14"><sup id="1SA.26.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
Then David shouted to Abner, “Abner, can you hear me?”</p>

David replied, “<span id="add-1SA.26.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">I am sure that</span> you are the greatest man in Israel [IRO, RHQ]!

You have done a very poor <span id="add-1SA.26.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">job of guarding Saul</span>. So just as surely as Yahweh lives, you and your men should be executed! You have not guarded your master whom Yahweh appointed to be the king. Where are the king’s spear and the water jug that were close to his head?”</p>

    <a href="#1SA.26.17"><sup id="1SA.26.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>

    <span id="add-1SA.26.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">The shouting woke </span> Saul <span id="add-1SA.26.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">up and he</span> recognized that it was David’s voice. He called out, saying, “My son David, is that your voice?”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.26.17" class="usx-p" >David replied, “Yes, your majesty it is my voice.”</p>

    <a href="#1SA.26.18"><sup id="1SA.26.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
Then David added, “Sir, why are you pursuing me [RHQ]? What wrong have I done [RHQ]? <a href="#1SA.26.19"><sup id="1SA.26.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
Your majesty, listen to me! If Yahweh has caused you to be angry with me, I should offer a sacrifice <span id="add-1SA.26.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in order to appease him</span>. But if it is people who have caused you to be angry with me, I hope/desire that Yahweh will curse them. They have forced me to leave the land that Yahweh gave to me. They have told me, ‘Go somewhere else and worship other gods!’ <a href="#1SA.26.20"><sup id="1SA.26.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
Now do not force me to die [MTY] far from <span id="add-1SA.26.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">where we worship</span> Yahweh. You, the king of Israel, have come here searching for me. <span id="add-1SA.26.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">But I do not want to harm you</span>! I am <span id="add-1SA.26.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">as harmless as</span> a flea [MET].

    <a href="#1SA.26.21"><sup id="1SA.26.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
Then Saul said, “David, my son. I have sinned <span id="add-1SA.26.21" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">by trying to kill you</span>. So come back home. Today you have considered my life to be very valuable <span id="add-1SA.26.21" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and so you have not killed me</span>.

    <a href="#1SA.26.22"><sup id="1SA.26.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
David replied, <span id="add-1SA.26.22" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">“ will leave</span> your spear here. Send one of your young men here to get it. <a href="#1SA.26.23"><sup id="1SA.26.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
Yahweh rewards us for the things that we do that are right and for being loyal <span id="add-1SA.26.23" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to him</span>. Even when Yahweh placed me where I could easily have killed you, I refused to do that, because you are the one whom Yahweh has appointed [MTY] to be the king. <a href="#1SA.26.24"><sup id="1SA.26.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
Just like I considered your life to be valuable <span id="add-1SA.26.24" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and spared your life</span> today, I hope/desire that Yahweh will consider my life to be valuable and <span id="add-1SA.26.24" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">spare my life and</span> save me from all my troubles.”</p>

    <a href="#1SA.26.25"><sup id="1SA.26.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
Then Saul said to David, “My son David, I pray that Yahweh will bless you. You will do great things very successfully.”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.26.25" class="usx-p" >Then David returned to his men, and Saul went back home.</p>
<a href="#1SA.27"><h3 id="1SA.27" class="usx-c">27</h3></a>
<p id="s1-1SA.27" class="usx-s1" >David stayed among the Philistia people-group</p>

But David thought, “Some day Saul will capture me <span id="add-1SA.27.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">if I stay around here</span>. So the best thing that I can do is to escape and go to the Philistia area. If I do that, Saul will stop searching for me here in Israel, and I will be safe.”</p>

    <a href="#1SA.27.2"><sup id="1SA.27.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
So David and his 600 men left Israel and went to see Maoch’s son Achish, who was king of Gath <span id="add-1SA.27.2" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">city in the Philistia area</span>. <a href="#1SA.27.3"><sup id="1SA.27.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
David and his men and their families started to live there in Gath, the city where king Achish lived. David’s two wives were with him—Ahinoam from Jezreel, and Nabal’s widow Abigail, from Carmel. <a href="#1SA.27.4"><sup id="1SA.27.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
When someone told Saul that David had run away <span id="add-1SA.27.4" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and was living</span> in Gath, he stopped searching for David.</p>
<p id="p-1SA.27.4" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1SA.27.5"><sup id="1SA.27.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>

    <span id="add-1SA.27.5" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">One day</span> David said to Achish, “If you are pleased with us, give us a place in one of the small villages where we can stay. There is no need [RHQ] for us to stay in the city where you are the king.”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.27.5" class="usx-p" >

    <span id="add-1SA.27.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Achish liked what David suggested</span>. So that day Achish gave to David Ziklag <span id="add-1SA.27.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">town</span>. As a result, Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah since that time.</p>

David <span id="add-1SA.27.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and his men</span> lived in the Philistia area for 16 months. <a href="#1SA.27.8"><sup id="1SA.27.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
<span id="add-1SA.27.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">During that time</span> David and his men raided the people who lived <span id="add-1SA.27.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in the areas</span> where the Geshur, Girzi, and Amalek people-groups lived. Those people had lived there a long time.

Whenever David’s men attacked them, they killed all the men and women, and they took all the people’s sheep and cattle and donkeys and camels, and even their clothes. Then they would bring those things back home, <span id="add-1SA.27.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and David would go to talk</span> to Achish.</p>

    <a href="#1SA.27.10"><sup id="1SA.27.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
Each time Achish would ask David, “Where did you go raiding today?” David <span id="add-1SA.27.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">would lie to him</span>. Sometimes he would reply that they had gone to the southern part of Judah, and sometimes he would say that they had gone to Jerahmeel, or to the area where the Ken people-group lived. <a href="#1SA.27.11"><sup id="1SA.27.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
David’s men never brought back to Gath any man or woman who was left alive. David thought, “If <span id="add-1SA.27.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">we do not kill everyone, some of</span> them <span id="add-1SA.27.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">who are still alive</span> will go and tell Achish <span id="add-1SA.27.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the truth</span> about what we really did.” David did that all the time that he <span id="add-1SA.27.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and his men</span> lived in the Philistia area. <a href="#1SA.27.12"><sup id="1SA.27.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
So Achish believed <span id="add-1SA.27.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">what</span> David <span id="add-1SA.27.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">told him</span>, and said to himself, “<span id="add-1SA.27.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Because of what David has done,</span> his own people, the Israelis, must now hate him very much.

Some time later, the people of Philistia gathered their army to attack the Israelis <span id="add-1SA.28.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">again</span>.

Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you bothered/disturbed me by causing me to appear?”</p>

Later, the Philistines again fought against the Israelis. The Israelis ran away from them, and ◄many Israelis were killed/the Philistines killed many Israelis► on Gilboa Mountain. <a href="#1SA.31.2"><sup id="1SA.31.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
The Philistines caught up with Saul and his three sons, and they killed <span id="add-1SA.31.2" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">all three of</span> his sons, Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchishua. <a href="#1SA.31.3"><sup id="1SA.31.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
The fighting was very fierce around Saul. When the Philistine ◄archers/men with bows and arrows► caught up with Saul, they wounded him badly <span id="add-1SA.31.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">with their arrows</span>.</p>

Saul said to the man who was carrying his weapons, “Take out your sword and kill me with it, in order that these heathen Philistines will not be able to thrust their swords into me and make fun of me <span id="add-1SA.31.4" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">while I am dying</span>.”</p>
<p id="p-1SA.31.4" class="usx-p" >But the man who was carrying Saul’s weapons was terrified, and refused to do that.

When the man carrying his weapons saw that Saul was dead, he also threw himself on his own sword and died. <a href="#1SA.31.6"><sup id="1SA.31.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
So Saul, three of his sons, and the man who carried Saul’s weapons, all died on that same day.</p>

They cut off Saul’s head and took his weapons.

They put Saul’s weapons in the temple of <span id="add-1SA.31.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">their goddess</span> Astarte. They also fastened the bodies of Saul <span id="add-1SA.31.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and his sons</span> to the wall <span id="add-1SA.31.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that surrounded</span> Beth-Shan <span id="add-1SA.31.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">city</span>.</p>

all their bravest soldiers walked all night to Beth-Shan. They took the corpses of Saul and his sons down from the city wall, and they took them back to Jabesh and burned the corpses there. <a href="#1SA.31.13"><sup id="1SA.31.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
They took the bones and buried them under a <span id="add-1SA.31.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">big</span> tamarisk tree. Then they ◄fasted/abstained from eating food► for seven days.</p>
