    <sup>1</sup>
    I am Nahum, from Elkosh village. This is a message about Nineveh city, the capital of Assyria that was given to me in a vision by Yahweh.</p><p>Yahweh is angry with the people of Nineveh</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Yahweh our God ◄is jealous/does not want people to worship any other god►.</p><p>He is very angry with those who worship other gods,</p><p>and he gets revenge [DOU] on all those who oppose him [DOU].</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Yahweh does not quickly become angry;</p><p>but he is very powerful,</p><p>and he will certainly punish [LIT] those who have done evil things [MTY].</p><p>He shows his power by sending whirlwinds and storms,</p><p>and clouds are like [MET] the dust stirred up by his feet.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>When he commands oceans and rivers to become dry,</p><p>they dry up.</p><p>
    He causes the grass in the fields in the Bashan region and on the slopes of Carmel Mountain to wither,</p><p>
    and causes the flowers in Lebanon to fade.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>When he appears, it is as though the mountains shake and the hills melt;</p><p>the earth quakes and the people on the earth tremble.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>There is no one [RHQ] who can resist him when he becomes extremely angry;</p><p>there is no one [RHQ] who can survive when his anger is very hot.</p><p>When he is very angry, it is as though his anger is like [SIM] a blazing fire,</p><p>and it is as though mountains are shattered into pieces.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>But he is good;</p><p>he protects us his people when we experience troubles.</p><p>He takes care of those who trust in him.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>But he will get rid of his enemies;</p><p>he will be to them like [MET] a flood that destroys everything.</p><p>He will chase his enemies</p><p>into the darkness of the place where the dead are.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    So, it is useless [RHQ] for you people of Nineveh to plot against Yahweh.</p><p>He will not need to strike you two times to destroy you;</p><p>he will destroy you by striking you only once.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    It will be as though his enemies are tangled in thorns,</p><p>and they will stagger like people who have drunk a lot of wine.</p><p>They will be burned up like [SIM] a fire completely burns up stubble/straw.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>In Nineveh city there was a man who advised people to do very wicked things to Yahweh.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>But this is what Yahweh says about you Israeli people:</p><p>“Although the people of Assyria have very many people and their army is very powerful,</p><p>they will be destroyed and will disappear.</p><p>
    I say to my people in Judah,</p><p>‘ have already punished you,</p><p>but I will not punish you again.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Now I will cause the people of Assyria to no longer control/oppress you [MET];</p><p>
    it will be as though I will tear off the shackles/chains on your hands and feet.”</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    And this is what Yahweh also declares about you people of Nineveh:</p><p>“You will not have any descendants who will continue to have your family names.</p><p>And I will destroy all the statues of your gods</p><p>that were carved or formed in molds.</p><p>I will cause you to be killed and sent to your graves,</p><p>because you are vile/despicable!”</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    You people of Judah, look! A messenger will be coming across the mountains,</p><p>and he [SYN] will be bringing good news to you.</p><p>He will be declaring that you will now have peace because Assyria will have been conquered.</p><p>
    So, celebrate your festivals,</p><p>and do what you solemnly promised to do when your enemies were threatening to attack you,</p><p>because your wicked enemies will not invade your country again,</p><p>
    because they will be completely destroyed.</p><a href="#NAHUM-c-2"><h3 id="NAHUM-c-2">2</h3></a>
<p>Nineveh will be destroyed</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    You people of [APO] Nineveh,</p><p>your enemies are coming to attack you.</p><p>
    So place guards on the tops of the walls around the city!</p><p>Guard the roads into the city!</p><p>Get ready to fight!</p><p>Gather your troops/soldiers [MTY] together!</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Even though enemy soldiers have destroyed the descendants of [MTY] Jacob,</p><p>Yahweh will cause them to be honored again.</p><p>Israel is like a grapevine that has been ruined,</p><p>but Israel will prosper again.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>The shields of the enemy soldiers who are coming to attack you will shine red as the sun shines on them,</p><p>and they will wear bright red uniforms.</p><p>The metal of their chariot wheels will flash when they line up before the battle,</p><p>and their soldiers will lift up their cypress/pine spears and wave them.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Their chariots will dash through the streets of Nineveh</p><p>and rush furiously through the plazas.</p><p>Going as quick as lightning,</p><p>they will resemble flaming torches.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Meanwhile, your king will summon his officers</p><p>who will stumble as they try to come quickly.</p><p>They will dash to the city wall,</p><p>holding their shields to protect themselves.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>But, the gates of the dams on the rivers will be thrown open by enemy soldiers,</p><p>and the flood will cause the palace to collapse.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>The queen will have her clothes stripped off her by enemy soldiers,</p><p>and her slave girls will moan like doves</p><p>and beat their breasts to show that they are very sad.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    The people will rush from Nineveh</p><p>like [SIM] water rushes from a broken dam.</p><p>
    The officials will shout, “Stop! Stop!”</p><p>but the people will not even look back as they run away.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    The enemy attackers say to each other, “Seize the silver!</p><p>Grab the gold!</p><p>There is a huge amount of very valuable things in this city,</p><p>more valuable things than anyone can count!”</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    Soon everything valuable in the city will be seized or ruined.</p><p>People will be trembling, with the result that they will not be able to fight.</p><p>Their faces will all become pale.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    After that happens, people will say,</p><p>“What happened to [RHQ] that great city of Nineveh?</p><p>
    It was like [MET] a den full of young lions,</p><p>where the male and female lions lived and fed the young ones.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    The soldiers in Nineveh were like [MET] lions that killed or strangled other animals</p><p>
    and brought the meat to their dens.”</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>The Commander of the armies of angels says to the people of Nineveh,</p><p>“I am opposed to you;</p><p>I will cause your chariots to be burned in fires and go up in smoke.</p><p>Your young men will be killed with swords.</p><p>
    Your soldiers will never again conquer other nations</p><p>and seize their valuable possessions.</p><p>Your messengers will never again take messages to other nations, demanding that their armies surrender to them.”</p><a href="#NAHUM-c-3"><h3 id="NAHUM-c-3">3</h3></a>
<p>Nineveh will be punished</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Terrible things will happen to Nineveh,</p><p>that city that is full of people who murder [MTY] and lie.</p><p>
    The city is full of things that were seized from other countries by their soldiers;</p><p>
    their armies continually [LIT] have acted brutally towards people whom they conquered.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>But now listen to the enemy soldiers coming to attack Nineveh;</p><p>
    listen to them cracking their whips,</p><p>and listen to the rattle of their chariot wheels!</p><p>
    Listen to their galloping horses</p><p>and their chariots as they bounce along!</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    Look at their flashing swords and glittering spears</p><p>as the horsemen race forward!</p><p>Many people of Nineveh will be killed;</p><p>
    there will be piles of corpses,</p><p>
    with the result that people will stumble over them.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>All that will happen because Nineveh is like [MET] a beautiful prostitute</p><p>
    who lures men to where they will be ruined;</p><p>
    Nineveh is a beautiful city</p><p>which has attracted/enticed people of other nations to come there.</p><p>
    The people of Nineveh taught those people of other nations rituals of magic,</p><p>and caused them to become their slaves.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    So the Commander of the armies of angels says to the people of Nineveh:</p><p>“I am your enemy,</p><p>and I will cause the people in other nations to see you completely humiliated</p><p>like [MET] women who have committed adultery are humiliated by having their skirts lifted high,</p><p>
    with the result that people can see their naked bodies.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>I will cause rubbish/garbage to be thrown at you;</p><p>I will show others that I despise you very much,</p><p>and I will cause you to be publicly ridiculed.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>All those who see you will turn their backs to you and say,</p><p>‘Nineveh is ruined,</p><p>but absolutely no one [RHQ] will mourn for it.’</p><p>No one will regret Nineveh being destroyed!”</p><p>The people of Nineveh will not be able to defend themselves</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Your city is certainly [RHQ] no safer than Thebes city was.</p><p>
    Thebes was an important city beside the Nile River;</p><p>the river was like [SIM] a wall that protected the city [DOU].</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    The rulers of Ethiopia and Egypt helped Thebes;</p><p>there was no limit to their power.</p><p>
    The governments of the nearby countries of Put and Libya were also allies of Thebes.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>But Thebes was captured,</p><p>and its people were ◄exiled/forced to go to other countries►.</p><p>Their babies were dashed to pieces in the streets of the city.</p><p>
    Enemy soldiers ◄cast lots/threw small marked stones► to decide who would get each official in Thebes to become his slave.</p><p>All the leaders of Thebes were fastened/tied by chains.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>You people of Nineveh will similarly become dazed and drunk,</p><p>and you will search for places to hide</p><p>
    to escape from your enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    Your enemies will cause the walls around your city to fall down</p><p>like [SIM] the first figs that fall from fig trees each year.</p><p>
    Your city will be captured easily, like [MET] figs that fall into the mouths [HYP] of those who shake the fig trees.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Look at your soldiers!</p><p>They will be as weak/helpless as [MET] women!</p><p>The gates of your city will be opened wide</p><p>
    to allow your enemies to enter them,</p><p>
    and then the bars of those gates will be burned.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>Store up water now to use when your enemies surround the city!</p><p>Repair the forts!</p><p>Dig up clay and trample it to make it soft,</p><p>and put it into molds to make bricks to repair the walls!</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    Nevertheless, your enemies will burn your city;</p><p>they will kill you with their swords;</p><p>they will kill you like [SIM] locusts destroy crops.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>In your city there are now very many merchants;</p><p>
    it seems that there are more of them than there are stars.</p><p>But when your city is being destroyed, those merchants will take the valuable things and disappear</p><p>
    like [SIM] locusts that strip the leaves from plants and then fly away.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Your leaders are also like a swarm of [SIM] locusts [DOU]</p><p>that crowd together on the stone fences/walls on a cold day,</p><p>and then fly away when the sun comes up,</p><p>and no one knows where they have gone.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>O King of Assyria, your officials will all be dead [EUP];</p><p>your important people will lie down and rest forever.</p><p>Your people will be scattered over the mountains,</p><p>and there will no one to gather them together.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>You are like someone who has a wound that cannot be healed;</p><p>
    it will be a wound that causes him to die.</p><p>And all those who hear about what has happened to you will clap their hands joyfully.</p><p>
    They will say, “Everyone has [RHQ] suffered because he continually was very cruel to us.”</p><a href="#NAHUM-h">^</a> <a href="#NAHUM-c-1">[1]</a> <a href="#NAHUM-c-2">[2]</a> <a href="#NAHUM-c-3">[3]</a>
