I told this message to Shealtiel’s son Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah, and to Jehozadak’s son Jeshua, the Supreme Priest.</p>

    <a href="#HAG.1.2"><sup id="HAG.1.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>

    <a href="#HAG.1.3"><sup id="HAG.1.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>

You eat <span id="add-HAG.1.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">food</span>, but you never get enough. You drink <span id="add-HAG.1.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">wine</span>, but you are still thirsty. You wear clothes, but you do not stay warm. You earn money, <span id="add-HAG.1.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">but things are very expensive</span>, with the result that <span id="add-HAG.1.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">it is as though</span> [MET] <span id="add-HAG.1.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">your money disappears because</span> you are putting it in purses/pockets that have <span id="add-HAG.1.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">big</span> holes in them.”</p>

    <span id="add-HAG.1.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">So</span> this is what Yahweh, the Commander of the armies of heaven, says: “Think about what is happening to you. <a href="#HAG.1.8"><sup id="HAG.1.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
<span id="add-HAG.1.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Then</span> go up into the hills, <span id="add-HAG.1.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">cut down trees,</span> and bring timber <span id="add-HAG.1.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">down here</span>, and rebuild my temple. When you do that, I will be pleased, and I will be honored. <a href="#HAG.1.9"><sup id="HAG.1.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
You expected <span id="add-HAG.1.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to harvest</span> plenty <span id="add-HAG.1.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">of crops</span>, but there were few <span id="add-HAG.1.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">crops to harvest</span>. And when you brought the crops home, I caused them to spoil [IDM] quickly. The reason <span id="add-HAG.1.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that happened is that</span> my temple is a ruins, while each of you are busy building your own <span id="add-HAG.1.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">beautiful</span> houses. <a href="#HAG.1.10"><sup id="HAG.1.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
It is because of what you <span id="add-HAG.1.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">are doing</span> that rain does not fall from the sky, and <span id="add-HAG.1.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">as a result</span> there are no crops. <a href="#HAG.1.11"><sup id="HAG.1.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
I have caused a ◄drought/severe lack of rain► on the hills and on your fields. The result has been that your grain <span id="add-HAG.1.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">has withered</span>, and your grapevines [MTY] and olive trees [MTY] and all your <span id="add-HAG.1.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">other</span> crops have dried up. <span id="add-HAG.1.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Because of that,</span> you and your cattle <span id="add-HAG.1.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">do not have enough food</span>, and the hard work that you have done will be for nothing.”</p>
<p id="p-HAG.1.11" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#HAG.1.12"><sup id="HAG.1.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
Then Zerubbabel and Jeshua and all the others of God’s people who were still alive obeyed the message that Yahweh our God had said, and they heeded the message that I had given them, because <span id="add-HAG.1.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">they knew that</span> Yahweh our God had sent/appointed me. And the people revered Yahweh.</p>
<p id="p-HAG.1.12" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#HAG.1.13"><sup id="HAG.1.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Then <span id="add-HAG.1.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">I</span>, Haggai, who was Yahweh’s messenger, gave this message from Yahweh to the people: “I, Yahweh, declare that I am with you.” <a href="#HAG.1.14"><sup id="HAG.1.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
<span id="add-HAG.1.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">So</span> Yahweh motivated Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the other people to want to rebuild the temple of our God, the Commander of the armies of angels.

<span id="add-HAG.1.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">They started work</span> on September 21st, during the second year that Darius was the king.</p>

On December 18 of that year, Yahweh gave <span id="add-HAG.2.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">another</span> message to <span id="add-HAG.2.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">me</span>, the prophet Haggai. <a href="#HAG.2.11"><sup id="HAG.2.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
