    <a href="#HAG.1.1"><sup id="HAG.1.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>

    <span id="add-HAG.1.1" class="usx-add">I am</span>, Haggai, a prophet. I received a message from Yahweh on August 29th, during the second year that Darius was the king <span id="add-HAG.1.1" class="usx-add">of Persia</span>. I told this message to Shealtiel’s son Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah, and to Jehozadak’s son Jeshua, the Supreme Priest.</p>
<p id="p-HAG.1.1" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#HAG.1.2"><sup id="HAG.1.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
Yahweh, the Commander of the armies of heaven, told <span id="add-HAG.1.2" class="usx-add">me</span> that the people were saying that it was not yet time for them to rebuild Yahweh’s temple.</p>
<p id="p-HAG.1.2" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#HAG.1.3"><sup id="HAG.1.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
Then Yahweh gave me this message <span id="add-HAG.1.3" class="usx-add">to tell to the people of Jerusalem</span>: <a href="#HAG.1.4"><sup id="HAG.1.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
“It is not right [RHQ] for you to be living in luxurious houses while my temple is only ruins! <a href="#HAG.1.5"><sup id="HAG.1.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
<span id="add-HAG.1.5" class="usx-add">I,</span> Yahweh, the Commander of the armies of heaven, say this: Think about what is happening to you. <a href="#HAG.1.6"><sup id="HAG.1.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
You have planted a lot <span id="add-HAG.1.6" class="usx-add">of seeds</span>, but you are not getting many <span id="add-HAG.1.6" class="usx-add">crops</span> to harvest. You eat <span id="add-HAG.1.6" class="usx-add">food</span>, but you never get enough. You drink <span id="add-HAG.1.6" class="usx-add">wine</span>, but you are still thirsty. You wear clothes, but you do not stay warm. You earn money, <span id="add-HAG.1.6" class="usx-add">but things are very expensive</span>, with the result that <span id="add-HAG.1.6" class="usx-add">it is as though</span> [MET] <span id="add-HAG.1.6" class="usx-add">your money disappears because</span> you are putting it in purses/pockets that have <span id="add-HAG.1.6" class="usx-add">big</span> holes in them.”</p>
<p id="p-HAG.1.6" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#HAG.1.7"><sup id="HAG.1.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>

    <span id="add-HAG.1.7" class="usx-add">So</span> this is what Yahweh, the Commander of the armies of heaven, says: “Think about what is happening to you. <a href="#HAG.1.8"><sup id="HAG.1.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
<span id="add-HAG.1.8" class="usx-add">Then</span> go up into the hills, <span id="add-HAG.1.8" class="usx-add">cut down trees,</span> and bring timber <span id="add-HAG.1.8" class="usx-add">down here</span>, and rebuild my temple. When you do that, I will be pleased, and I will be honored. <a href="#HAG.1.9"><sup id="HAG.1.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
You expected <span id="add-HAG.1.9" class="usx-add">to harvest</span> plenty <span id="add-HAG.1.9" class="usx-add">of crops</span>, but there were few <span id="add-HAG.1.9" class="usx-add">crops to harvest</span>. And when you brought the crops home, I caused them to spoil [IDM] quickly. The reason <span id="add-HAG.1.9" class="usx-add">that happened is that</span> my temple is a ruins, while each of you are busy building your own <span id="add-HAG.1.9" class="usx-add">beautiful</span> houses. <a href="#HAG.1.10"><sup id="HAG.1.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
It is because of what you <span id="add-HAG.1.10" class="usx-add">are doing</span> that rain does not fall from the sky, and <span id="add-HAG.1.10" class="usx-add">as a result</span> there are no crops. <a href="#HAG.1.11"><sup id="HAG.1.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
I have caused a ◄drought/severe lack of rain► on the hills and on your fields. The result has been that your grain <span id="add-HAG.1.11" class="usx-add">has withered</span>, and your grapevines [MTY] and olive trees [MTY] and all your <span id="add-HAG.1.11" class="usx-add">other</span> crops have dried up. <span id="add-HAG.1.11" class="usx-add">Because of that,</span> you and your cattle <span id="add-HAG.1.11" class="usx-add">do not have enough food</span>, and the hard work that you have done will be for nothing.”</p>
<p id="p-HAG.1.11" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#HAG.1.12"><sup id="HAG.1.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
Then Zerubbabel and Jeshua and all the others of God’s people who were still alive obeyed the message that Yahweh our God had said, and they heeded the message that I had given them, because <span id="add-HAG.1.12" class="usx-add">they knew that</span> Yahweh our God had sent/appointed me. And the people revered Yahweh.</p>
<p id="p-HAG.1.12" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#HAG.1.13"><sup id="HAG.1.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Then <span id="add-HAG.1.13" class="usx-add">I</span>, Haggai, who was Yahweh’s messenger, gave this message from Yahweh to the people: “I, Yahweh, declare that I am with you.” <a href="#HAG.1.14"><sup id="HAG.1.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
<span id="add-HAG.1.14" class="usx-add">So</span> Yahweh motivated Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the other people to want to rebuild the temple of our God, the Commander of the armies of angels. They gathered together and started to work to rebuild it. <a href="#HAG.1.15"><sup id="HAG.1.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
<span id="add-HAG.1.15" class="usx-add">They started work</span> on September 21st, during the second year that Darius was the king.</p>
<a href="#HAG.2"><h3 id="HAG.2" class="usx-c">2</h3></a>
<p id="s1-HAG.2" class="usx-s1" >The new temple</p>
<p id="p-HAG.2" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#HAG.2.1"><sup id="HAG.2.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
On October 17 <span id="add-HAG.2.1" class="usx-add">of that year</span>, Yahweh gave <span id="add-HAG.2.1" class="usx-add">me</span>, the prophet Haggai, <span id="add-HAG.2.1" class="usx-add">another</span> message. <a href="#HAG.2.2"><sup id="HAG.2.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
<span id="add-HAG.2.2" class="usx-add">The message was that I should</span> say this to Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and to the other people who were still alive <span id="add-HAG.2.2" class="usx-add">in Jerusalem</span>: <a href="#HAG.2.3"><sup id="HAG.2.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
“Do any of you remember how glorious our former temple was? <span id="add-HAG.2.3" class="usx-add">If you do,</span> what does it look like to you now? It must seem like nothing at all. <a href="#HAG.2.4"><sup id="HAG.2.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
But now the Commander of the armies of angels says to <span id="add-HAG.2.4" class="usx-add">all of you</span>, to Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of you people who live in this nation, ‘<span id="add-HAG.2.4" class="usx-add">Do not be discouraged;</span> be strong [DOU], and work <span id="add-HAG.2.4" class="usx-add">to build this new temple</span>, because I will ◄be with/help► you. <a href="#HAG.2.5"><sup id="HAG.2.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
My Spirit remains among you, like I promised your <span id="add-HAG.2.5" class="usx-add">ancestors</span> when they left Egypt. <span id="add-HAG.2.5" class="usx-add">So</span> do not be afraid!’&#160;”</p>
<p id="p-HAG.2.5" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#HAG.2.6"><sup id="HAG.2.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
This is what the Commander of the armies of angels says: “Soon I will shake the sky and the earth, the oceans and the land again. <a href="#HAG.2.7"><sup id="HAG.2.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
I will shake <span id="add-HAG.2.7" class="usx-add">again the people of </span> all the nations, and as a result they will bring their treasures <span id="add-HAG.2.7" class="usx-add">to this temple</span>. I will fill this temple with <span id="add-HAG.2.7" class="usx-add">my</span> glory. <a href="#HAG.2.8"><sup id="HAG.2.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
The silver and the gold <span id="add-HAG.2.8" class="usx-add">that they own</span> are <span id="add-HAG.2.8" class="usx-add">really</span> mine, <span id="add-HAG.2.8" class="usx-add">so they will bring them to me</span>. <a href="#HAG.2.9"><sup id="HAG.2.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
<span id="add-HAG.2.9" class="usx-add">Then</span> this temple will be more glorious than the former/previous <span id="add-HAG.2.9" class="usx-add">temple was</span>. And I will cause things to go well for you all. <span id="add-HAG.2.9" class="usx-add">That will surely happen because I,</span> the Commander of the armies of angels, have said it.”</p>
<p id="s1-HAG.2.9" class="usx-s1" >What they do now will be acceptable to Yahweh</p>
<p id="p-HAG.2.9" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#HAG.2.10"><sup id="HAG.2.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
On December 18 of that year, Yahweh gave <span id="add-HAG.2.10" class="usx-add">another</span> message to <span id="add-HAG.2.10" class="usx-add">me</span>, the prophet Haggai. <a href="#HAG.2.11"><sup id="HAG.2.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
This is what the Commander of the armies of angels said to me: “Ask the priests <span id="add-HAG.2.11" class="usx-add">this question</span> about what is written in the laws <span id="add-HAG.2.11" class="usx-add">of Moses about sacrifices</span>: <a href="#HAG.2.12"><sup id="HAG.2.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
‘If one <span id="add-HAG.2.12" class="usx-add">of you priests takes from the altar some</span> meat that was sacrificed and is carrying it in his robes, if his robe touches <span id="add-HAG.2.12" class="usx-add">some</span> bread or stew or wine or <span id="add-HAG.2.12" class="usx-add">olive</span> oil or some other food, does that food also become ◄holy/acceptable for a sacrifice►?’”</p>
<p id="p-HAG.2.12" class="usx-p" >
    <span id="add-HAG.2.12" class="usx-add">When he said that to</span> the priests, they replied, “No.”</p>
<p id="p-HAG.2.12" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#HAG.2.13"><sup id="HAG.2.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Then Haggai asked them, “If someone becomes unacceptable to God by touching a corpse, and <span id="add-HAG.2.13" class="usx-add">then he</span> touches any of those foods, will the food <span id="add-HAG.2.13" class="usx-add">also</span> become unacceptable to God?”</p>
<p id="p-HAG.2.13" class="usx-p" >The priests replied, “Yes.”</p>
<p id="p-HAG.2.13" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#HAG.2.14"><sup id="HAG.2.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
Then Haggai replied, “Yahweh says <span id="add-HAG.2.14" class="usx-add">this</span>: ‘It is the same with you people and with this nation. Everything that you do and <span id="add-HAG.2.14" class="usx-add">all the sacrifices</span> that you all offer are unacceptable to me <span id="add-HAG.2.14" class="usx-add">because of the sins that you have committed</span>.</p>
<p id="p-HAG.2.14" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#HAG.2.15"><sup id="HAG.2.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
Think about what has been happening to you before you began to lay the foundation of my temple. <a href="#HAG.2.16"><sup id="HAG.2.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
When you expected <span id="add-HAG.2.16" class="usx-add">to harvest</span> 20 bushels <span id="add-HAG.2.16" class="usx-add">of grain, you harvested</span> only ten bushels. When someone went to a <span id="add-HAG.2.16" class="usx-add">big</span> wine vat to get 50 gallons <span id="add-HAG.2.16" class="usx-add">of wine</span>, there were only 20 <span id="add-HAG.2.16" class="usx-add">gallons in the vat</span>. <a href="#HAG.2.17"><sup id="HAG.2.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
I sent ◄blight/hot winds► and mildew and hail to destroy all your crops. But still you did not return to me.</p>
<p id="p-HAG.2.17" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#HAG.2.18"><sup id="HAG.2.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
Starting from this day, December 18, the day when <span id="add-HAG.2.18" class="usx-add">you</span> have laid the foundation of my <span id="add-HAG.2.18" class="usx-add">new</span> temple, continue to think carefully <span id="add-HAG.2.18" class="usx-add">about your situation</span>. <a href="#HAG.2.19"><sup id="HAG.2.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>

<p id="p-HAG.2.19" class="usx-p" >But, from now on, I will bless you!’&#160;”</p>
