“Go throughout the camp and tell the people this: ‘Prepare all the food that you will take with you, because the day after tomorrow you will cross this Jordan <span id="add-JOS.1.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">River</span>, in order to possess the land that Yahweh, our God, is about to give you.’&#160;”</p>

“Do not forget what Moses, the servant of Yahweh, commanded you: ‘Yahweh, your God, has given you this land in order that you can <span id="add-JOS.1.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">live here</span> safely/peacefully.’ <a href="#JOS.1.14"><sup id="JOS.1.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>

until they are able to live there safely/peacefully, as Yahweh has enabled you to do. You must help them until after they have conquered all the people in the land that Yahweh, your God, is giving them.

<p id="p-JOS.2" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JOS.2.1"><sup id="JOS.2.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
Then Joshua <span id="add-JOS.2.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">chose</span> two men from <span id="add-JOS.2.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">their camp at</span> Acacia. He told them, “Go <span id="add-JOS.2.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">across the Jordan River</span> and secretly find out all that you can about the land on that side of the river, especially about Jericho <span id="add-JOS.2.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">city</span>.” So the two men crossed <span id="add-JOS.2.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the river and entered Jericho</span>. They entered the house of a prostitute, whose name was Rahab. They stayed in her house <span id="add-JOS.2.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that night</span>. <a href="#JOS.2.2"><sup id="JOS.2.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
But someone <span id="add-JOS.2.2" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">saw them and</span> told the king of Jericho, “Some Israeli men have come here tonight to spy out the land!” <a href="#JOS.2.3"><sup id="JOS.2.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
So the king sent some messengers to tell Rahab, “Bring out the men who came and entered your house, <span id="add-JOS.2.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">so that we can kill them</span>, because they have come <span id="add-JOS.2.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">here</span> to ◄spy out/find out all they can about► this land!” <a href="#JOS.2.4"><sup id="JOS.2.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
She told them that the two men had gone to her house. But she had hidden the two men there. So when the messengers came to her house, she told them, “Two men came here, but I did not know where they had come from. <a href="#JOS.2.5"><sup id="JOS.2.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
At dusk, just before ◄guards closed the city gate/the city gates were closed►, the two men left. I do not know where they went. So, go quickly and search for them! Perhaps you may catch them!” <a href="#JOS.2.6"><sup id="JOS.2.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
But <span id="add-JOS.2.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">she was lying,</span> she had taken the two men up to the <span id="add-JOS.2.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">flat</span> roof of her house and had hidden them under the piles of flax that she had laid on the roof. <a href="#JOS.2.7"><sup id="JOS.2.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
The messengers went out of the city to search for the two men. Immediately, the guards shut the city gate. The messengers went along the road that leads down to the place where people can walk across the Jordan <span id="add-JOS.2.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">River</span>, <span id="add-JOS.2.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">but they did not find the two men</span>.</p>
<p id="p-JOS.2.7" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JOS.2.8"><sup id="JOS.2.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
Before the two men lay down <span id="add-JOS.2.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to sleep</span> that night, Rahab went up to the roof <a href="#JOS.2.9"><sup id="JOS.2.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
and said to them, “We know that Yahweh <span id="add-JOS.2.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">is about to</span> give this land to you Israelis, and as a result all the people living in this land are terrified because of you. <a href="#JOS.2.10"><sup id="JOS.2.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
We have heard about how Yahweh dried up the water of the Red Sea for you to cross it when you left Egypt. And we have heard how you killed Sihon and Og, the two kings of the tribe of Amor who lived east of the Jordan <span id="add-JOS.2.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">River</span>. You <span id="add-JOS.2.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Israelis</span> totally destroyed everyone <span id="add-JOS.2.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and everything in their kingdom</span>. <a href="#JOS.2.11"><sup id="JOS.2.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
When we heard about those things, we were very dismayed. We no longer have enough courage to fight against you, because we know that Yahweh, the God whom you <span id="add-JOS.2.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">worship</span>, is helping you. <span id="add-JOS.2.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">And we know that</span> he rules everything in heaven and here on earth. <a href="#JOS.2.12"><sup id="JOS.2.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
So now <span id="add-JOS.2.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">I want you to</span> solemnly promise me, and ask Yahweh to punish you if you do not do what you promise. Solemnly promise me that you will act kindly to me and my family, because I have acted kindly to you. <a href="#JOS.2.13"><sup id="JOS.2.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Do something to prove that you will ◄spare the lives of/not kill► my father and my mother, my brothers and sisters, and all of their families. Promise me that you <span id="add-JOS.2.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Israelis</span> will not kill us <span id="add-JOS.2.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">when you destroy this city</span>.” <a href="#JOS.2.14"><sup id="JOS.2.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
The two men replied, “We desire that God will cause us to die if we do not do as we say! If you do not tell others what we <span id="add-JOS.2.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">are planning to</span> do, we will act kindly toward you all when Yahweh enables us to possess the land.” <a href="#JOS.2.15"><sup id="JOS.2.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
<span id="add-JOS.2.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">One of</span> the outside walls of the house where Rahab lived was part of the wall <span id="add-JOS.2.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that was around</span> the city. So she fastened a rope outside the window <span id="add-JOS.2.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that was in that wall</span>, by which the men could climb down the wall. <a href="#JOS.2.16"><sup id="JOS.2.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
Then she said to them, “When you leave the city, go up into the hills so that the men who are searching for you will not find you. Hide in caves in the hills for three days, until the men who are searching for you return to the city. Then you can return safely to your camp.” <a href="#JOS.2.17"><sup id="JOS.2.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
The two men <span id="add-JOS.2.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">gave her a red cord, and</span> said to her, “This is what you must do; if you do not do this, we will not be required to do what we have vowed to do. <a href="#JOS.2.18"><sup id="JOS.2.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
You must tie this red cord in the window that has the rope by which we will climb down. You must let the cord hang there. And you must bring your father and your mother and your brothers and all the others in your family inside the house. Then, when our army enters your land, we will see the cord, and we will not kill the people in your house. <a href="#JOS.2.19"><sup id="JOS.2.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
If anyone in your family goes outside this house into the street, <span id="add-JOS.2.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">our soldiers</span> will kill them, and we will not be guilty [MTY] for doing that. But if anyone who is in this house with you is injured, we will be guilty for causing that. <a href="#JOS.2.20"><sup id="JOS.2.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
But if you tell anyone what we <span id="add-JOS.2.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">are planning to</span> do, we are not required to do what we have vowed to do.” <a href="#JOS.2.21"><sup id="JOS.2.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
Rahab said, “I agree to do what you say.” So they climbed down the rope and left. And she left the red cord tied in the window. <a href="#JOS.2.22"><sup id="JOS.2.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
When the two men left the city, they went up into the hills. They stayed there for three days, while the men <span id="add-JOS.2.22" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">who had been sent by the king</span> continued to search for them. They searched all along the road, but they did not find the two men. So they returned to the city. <a href="#JOS.2.23"><sup id="JOS.2.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
Then the two men started back toward their camp. They went down from the hills, went down to the river, crossed it at the place where people can walk across it, and returned to their camp. They told Joshua everything that had happened to them. <a href="#JOS.2.24"><sup id="JOS.2.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
They said to Joshua, “We are sure that Yahweh is going to enable us to possess everything that is in that land. The people there are terrified [IDM] because of us.”</p>

And Joshua told the soldiers, “Start marching! March around the city, with several soldiers with weapons marching in front.

<p id="p-JOS.6.7" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JOS.6.8"><sup id="JOS.6.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
After Joshua told that to the army, the seven priests, each carrying a sacred trumpet, started marching, blowing their trumpets. The four priests who were carrying Yahweh’s sacred chest followed them. <a href="#JOS.6.9"><sup id="JOS.6.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
The group of soldiers carrying weapons marched in front of the priests who were blowing their trumpets, and the rest of the soldiers followed <span id="add-JOS.6.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the four men carrying</span> the chest. While <span id="add-JOS.6.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">they were all marching</span>, <span id="add-JOS.6.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the seven priests</span> were blowing their trumpets. <a href="#JOS.6.10"><sup id="JOS.6.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
But <span id="add-JOS.6.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the rest of</span> the people <span id="add-JOS.6.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">were silent, because</span> Joshua had commanded them, “Do not make a war cry. Do not yell or say anything until the day when I tell you to shout. On that day, you must shout <span id="add-JOS.6.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">loudly</span>!” <a href="#JOS.6.11"><sup id="JOS.6.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
So the men carrying Yahweh’s sacred chest and all the others did what Joshua told them to do. They marched around the city once. Then they all returned to their camp and stayed there that night.</p>
<p id="p-JOS.6.11" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JOS.6.12"><sup id="JOS.6.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
The next morning, Joshua and the priests got up early, and the four priests carried Yahweh’s sacred chest <span id="add-JOS.6.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">again</span>. <a href="#JOS.6.13"><sup id="JOS.6.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
The seven priests who were carrying trumpets went in front of <span id="add-JOS.6.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the men carrying</span> the chest. The seven priests were blowing their trumpets as they marched. The group of soldiers carrying weapons went in front of all the others, and the rest of the army followed all the others. All the time, the seven priests were blowing their trumpets. <a href="#JOS.6.14"><sup id="JOS.6.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
So on that second day they again marched around the city once and then returned to their camp. They did the same thing for six days.</p>
<p id="p-JOS.6.14" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JOS.6.15"><sup id="JOS.6.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
On the seventh day, they got up at dawn, and they all marched around the city the same way that they had done before, but this time they marched around the city seven times. <a href="#JOS.6.16"><sup id="JOS.6.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
As they were marching around the seventh time, when the priests were about to blow the long/loud blast on their trumpets, Joshua commanded the people, “Shout, because Yahweh will enable you to capture the city! <a href="#JOS.6.17"><sup id="JOS.6.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
Yahweh has declared that you must destroy [IDM] the city and everything in it <span id="add-JOS.6.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to show that it belongs to him</span>. You must spare only Rahab the prostitute and the others who are in her house, because she hid the spies whom we sent there. <a href="#JOS.6.18"><sup id="JOS.6.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
And because Yahweh has declared that everything must be destroyed [IDM], you must not take [EUP] any of the things in the city. If you take anything, you will cause Yahweh to destroy our own camp and cause terrible things to happen to us. <a href="#JOS.6.19"><sup id="JOS.6.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
But all the silver and gold and articles made from iron and bronze that you find, you must set apart for Yahweh. You must put those things in his treasury.”</p>
<p id="p-JOS.6.19" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JOS.6.20"><sup id="JOS.6.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
So they did what Joshua told them to do. When the priests blew a long blast on their trumpets, the people/army shouted loudly, and the wall of the city collapsed! Then the Israeli soldiers rushed in and captured the city. <a href="#JOS.6.21"><sup id="JOS.6.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
They killed [IDM] every living thing in the city—men and women, young people and old people, even cattle and sheep and donkeys.</p>
<p id="p-JOS.6.21" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JOS.6.22"><sup id="JOS.6.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
Then Joshua said to the two men ◄who had spied on/whom he had sent to learn all they could about► the land, “Go to the prostitute’s house. Bring her out, along with all her family, just as you promised to her.” <a href="#JOS.6.23-25"><sup id="JOS.6.23-25" class="usx-v">23-25</sup></a>
So those two spies/men went into Rahab’s house and brought her out. They also brought out her father and mother and her brothers, and all the rest of her family. Joshua’s men spared Rahab the prostitute. They also did not kill all her relatives, because she had hidden and protected the spies/men whom Joshua had sent to Jericho. The two men brought them all out and put them in a place outside the camp of the Israelis. Rahab still lives among us Israeli people. Then the soldiers gathered the articles made from silver, gold, bronze, and iron that they found and they put them all into Yahweh’s treasury. But they burned everything else that was in the city.</p>
<p id="p-JOS.6.23-25" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JOS.6.26"><sup id="JOS.6.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
At that time, Joshua warned the people, “Yahweh will curse/punish anyone who tries to rebuild this city, Jericho. When that person lays/builds its foundation, his oldest son will die. And when he finishes building the city wall and sets up its gates, his youngest son will die.”</p>
<p id="p-JOS.6.26" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JOS.6.27"><sup id="JOS.6.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
Because of what happened that day, it was clear that Yahweh was with/helped Joshua, and Joshua became famous throughout the land.</p>

Yahweh had commanded that all the things <span id="add-JOS.7.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that they had captured in Jericho</span> should be <span id="add-JOS.7.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">destroyed to show that they belong</span> to him. But there was a man from the tribe of Judah named Achan. He was the son of Carmi and grandson of Zabdi and great-grandson of Zerah.

So about 3,000 Israeli men went <span id="add-JOS.7.4" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to attack Ai</span>. But the men of Ai defeated them badly. <a href="#JOS.7.5"><sup id="JOS.7.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
They killed about 36 Israelis and chased the rest of Israeli men from the city gate to the bottom of the hill. When the other Israelis saw that this had happened, they became very discouraged.</p>

Joshua and the other Israeli leaders tore their clothes <span id="add-JOS.7.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">because they were very sad about being defeated</span>.

Joshua and the Israeli soldiers <span id="add-JOS.8.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">who were with him</span> allowed the army of Ai to push them back. They ran toward the desert. <a href="#JOS.8.16"><sup id="JOS.8.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
The men in Ai were ordered to chase after Joshua and his men. So they left the city and started to pursue the Israelis. <a href="#JOS.8.17"><sup id="JOS.8.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
All the men of Ai and the men of Bethel pursued the Israeli army. They did not leave even one man in Ai to defend it. The <span id="add-JOS.8.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">gates of the</span> city were left wide open.</p>

    <a href="#JOS.8.18"><sup id="JOS.8.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
Then Yahweh said to Joshua, “<span id="add-JOS.8.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Lift up</span> your spear <span id="add-JOS.8.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and </span> point it toward Ai, because I am going to enable your soldiers to capture it!” So Joshua pointed <span id="add-JOS.8.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">his spear</span> toward Ai. <a href="#JOS.8.19"><sup id="JOS.8.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
When the Israeli men who were hiding saw that, they rushed out from the places where they were hiding and ran into the city. They quickly captured it and set it on fire.</p>

Joshua and his men saw that the men who had been hiding had captured the city and were burning it, and they saw the smoke rising. So they turned around and started to attack the men of Ai. <a href="#JOS.8.22"><sup id="JOS.8.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
Meanwhile, the soldiers who had captured the city came out <span id="add-JOS.8.22" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and attacked them from the rear</span>. So the men of Ai were caught between the two groups of Israeli soldiers. None of the men of Ai escaped. The Israelis fought until they killed all of them. Only the king of Ai was still alive. <a href="#JOS.8.23"><sup id="JOS.8.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
Then they seized the king of Ai and brought him to Joshua.</p>

While they were fighting, the Israeli army pursued the men of Ai into the fields and into the desert, and killed all of them. Then they went to Ai and killed everyone who was there. <a href="#JOS.8.25"><sup id="JOS.8.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
They killed 12,000 men and women. <a href="#JOS.8.26"><sup id="JOS.8.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
Joshua continued to point his spear [LIT] toward Ai, until all the people in Ai had been killed. <a href="#JOS.8.27"><sup id="JOS.8.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
The Israeli soldiers took for themselves the animals and the other things that had belonged to the people of Ai, just like Yahweh had told Joshua that they should do.</p>

Joshua and his soldiers burned Ai city and caused it to become a pile of ruins. It is still like that today. <a href="#JOS.8.29"><sup id="JOS.8.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>
Joshua hanged the king of Ai on a tree and left his corpse hanging there until the evening. At sunset Joshua told his men to take the king’s corpse down from the tree and to throw it on the ground at the city gate. <span id="add-JOS.8.29" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">After they did that</span>, they piled a lot of rocks on top of the corpse, and that pile of rocks is still there.</p>

Joshua <span id="add-JOS.8.30" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">told his men to</span> build on Ebal Mountain an altar for Yahweh, the God <span id="add-JOS.8.30" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">who is worshiped by</span> the Israeli people. <a href="#JOS.8.31"><sup id="JOS.8.31" class="usx-v">31</sup></a>
They built it just like Moses, the man who served God <span id="add-JOS.8.31" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">well</span>, had written previously in the laws <span id="add-JOS.8.31" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that God had given to him</span>.

They also offered sacrifices to restore fellowship with Yahweh. <a href="#JOS.8.32"><sup id="JOS.8.32" class="usx-v">32</sup></a>
As the Israelis watched, Joshua wrote on stones the laws that <span id="add-JOS.8.32" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Yahweh had given</span> to Moses previously. <a href="#JOS.8.33"><sup id="JOS.8.33" class="usx-v">33</sup></a>
The Israeli leaders, the officials, the judges, and other Israelis were there, standing nearby. Many people who were not Israelis were also there.

The sacred chest was <span id="add-JOS.8.33" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in the valley</span> between the two groups. That was what Moses had previously commanded that the people should do when <span id="add-JOS.8.33" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Yahweh was about to</span> bless them.</p>

All the Israelis gathered together <span id="add-JOS.8.35" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to listen</span>—the men, the women, and the children. The ◄foreigners/people who were not Israelis► who were living among them also listened, while Joshua read all the commands that Moses had written.</p>

There were several kings <span id="add-JOS.9.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">who ruled in lands that are</span> on the west side of the Jordan River. They were the kings of the Heth people-group, the Amor people-group, the Canaan people-group, the Periz people-group, the Hiv people-group, and the Jebus people-group.

They put on old sandals that had been patched, and wore old ragged clothes. And they took along bread that was dry and moldy. <a href="#JOS.9.6"><sup id="JOS.9.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>

On the day that Yahweh enabled the Israeli army to defeat the groups who were descendants of Amor, Joshua said to Yahweh while the Israeli people were listening, “Yahweh, cause the sun to stand still over Gibeon, and cause the moon to not move when it is over Aijalon Valley.” <a href="#JOS.10.13"><sup id="JOS.10.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
And that is what happened. The sun stood still, and the moon did not move, until the Israeli army defeated their enemies. That is what has been written in the book that Jashar wrote.

On that day Yahweh did a great miracle that someone asked him to do. There was never a day like that previously, and there has never been a day like that since. Yahweh was certainly fighting for the Israeli people!</p>
