After King Artaxerxes <span id="add-NEH.2.1" class="usx-add">had been ruling the Persian Empire</span> for almost 20 years, ◄during the spring/before the hot season► of that year, when it was time to serve wine to him <span id="add-NEH.2.1" class="usx-add">during a feast</span>, I took the wine and gave it to him.

So he asked me, “Why are you sad? <span id="add-NEH.2.2" class="usx-add">I know that</span> you are not sick. It must be that you are troubled about something.” Then I was very afraid, <span id="add-NEH.2.2" class="usx-add">because it was not proper to be sad when I came to the king</span> (OR, <span id="add-NEH.2.2" class="usx-add">because I was worried what the king would do to me if he refused to do what I was about to request him to do</span>).</p>
<p id="p-NEH.2.2" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#NEH.2.3"><sup id="NEH.2.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
I replied, “Your majesty, I hope you will live a very long time!

<p id="p-NEH.2.4" class="usx-p" >I prayed <span id="add-NEH.2.4" class="usx-add">silently</span> to our God <span id="add-NEH.2.4" class="usx-add">who is/rules</span> in heaven. <a href="#NEH.2.5"><sup id="NEH.2.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
Then I replied, “If you are willing <span id="add-NEH.2.5" class="usx-add">to do it</span>, and if I have pleased you, send me to the city <span id="add-NEH.2.5" class="usx-add">of Jerusalem</span> in Judah <span id="add-NEH.2.5" class="usx-add">province</span> where my ancestors are buried, in order that I may <span id="add-NEH.2.5" class="usx-add">help people to</span> rebuild the city.”</p>

    <a href="#NEH.2.6"><sup id="NEH.2.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
While the queen was sitting beside the king, he asked, <span id="add-NEH.2.6" class="usx-add">“If I allow you to go,</span> how long will you be gone?

<p id="p-NEH.2.6" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#NEH.2.7"><sup id="NEH.2.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
I also said to the king, “If you are willing to do it, write letters for me to take to the governors of the province west of the <span id="add-NEH.2.7" class="usx-add">Euphrates</span> River. Tell them to allow me to travel safely <span id="add-NEH.2.7" class="usx-add">through their province</span> until I arrive in Judah. <a href="#NEH.2.8"><sup id="NEH.2.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
Also, <span id="add-NEH.2.8" class="usx-add">please write</span> a letter to Asaph, the man who takes care of your forest <span id="add-NEH.2.8" class="usx-add">in that area</span>, telling him to give me timber to make the beams to support the gates of the fortress that is near the temple, and timber for making the walls of the city, and for building the house in which I <span id="add-NEH.2.8" class="usx-add">will live</span>.” The king did what I requested him to do, because my God was graciously/kindly ◄helping/acting for► me.</p>
<p id="p-NEH.2.8" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#NEH.2.9"><sup id="NEH.2.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>

    <span id="add-NEH.2.9" class="usx-add">After I got ready, I left to travel to Judah</span>. The king sent some army officers and soldiers riding on horses to accompany me, <span id="add-NEH.2.9" class="usx-add">to protect me</span>. When I came to where the governors of the provinces west of the <span id="add-NEH.2.9" class="usx-add">Euphrates</span> River lived, I gave them the letters that the king had written.</p>

<p id="s1-NEH.2.10" class="usx-s1" >Nehemiah inspected the walls of Jerusalem</p>

    <a href="#NEH.2.11-12"><sup id="NEH.2.11-12" class="usx-v">11-12</sup></a>
When I arrived in Jerusalem, I did not tell anyone what thoughts God had given to me about what I should do there. Three days after I arrived in Jerusalem, I went out of the city in the evening, taking a few other men with me. I was riding a donkey; we had no other animals with us.</p>
<p id="p-NEH.2.11-12" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#NEH.2.13"><sup id="NEH.2.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
We left the city, going out through the Valley Gate, then past the well called the Jackal (OR, Dragon’s) Well, and then past the gate called the Rubbish/Garbage Gate. We inspected all the walls that had been broken down and all the gates that had been burned down. <a href="#NEH.2.14"><sup id="NEH.2.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
Then we went to the Fountain Gate and to the pool called the King’s Pool, but my donkey could not get through <span id="add-NEH.2.14" class="usx-add">the narrow opening</span> (OR, <span id="add-NEH.2.14" class="usx-add">the rubble</span>). <a href="#NEH.2.15"><sup id="NEH.2.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
So we turned back and went along the <span id="add-NEH.2.15" class="usx-add">Kidron</span> Valley. We inspected the wall there before we turned back/around and entered the city again at the Valley Gate. <a href="#NEH.2.16"><sup id="NEH.2.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
The <span id="add-NEH.2.16" class="usx-add">city</span> officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, because I had not told anyone about what I planned to do. I had not said anything about it to the Jewish leaders or the officials or the priests or any of the others who would be helping me in the work <span id="add-NEH.2.16" class="usx-add">that I wanted to do</span>.</p>
<p id="p-NEH.2.16" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#NEH.2.17"><sup id="NEH.2.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
But now I said to them, “You all know very well the terrible things <span id="add-NEH.2.17" class="usx-add">that have happened to</span> our city. The city is ruined; even the gates are burned down. So we should rebuild the city wall. If we do that, we will no longer feel humiliated/disgraced.” <a href="#NEH.2.18"><sup id="NEH.2.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
Then I told them about how God had kindly/graciously helped me <span id="add-NEH.2.18" class="usx-add">when I talked to the king</span>, and what the king had said to me.</p>
<p id="p-NEH.2.18" class="usx-p" >They immediately replied, “Let’s start rebuilding!” So they started to do this good work.</p>

    <a href="#NEH.2.19"><sup id="NEH.2.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
But when Sanballat, Tobiah, and Gershom the Arab <span id="add-NEH.2.19" class="usx-add">king of the Kedar region</span> heard about what we planned to do, they made fun of us and ridiculed us. They said, “What is this work that you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king <span id="add-NEH.2.19" class="usx-add">again</span>?” [RHQ]</p>
<p id="p-NEH.2.19" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#NEH.2.20"><sup id="NEH.2.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
But I replied, “Our God <span id="add-NEH.2.20" class="usx-add">who is/rules</span> in heaven will help our plans to succeed. But as for you, you have no right to decide anything about this city, because you have not participated in what has happened in this city in previous years.”</p>

So I put guards at the places where the wall was not very high yet and at places where there were gaps in the wall. I put guards to protect each of their family groups.

Those who carried <span id="add-NEH.4.17" class="usx-add">baskets of supplies on their heads/shoulders</span> and those who built the wall did their work with one hand, and held a weapon with the other hand. <a href="#NEH.4.18"><sup id="NEH.4.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
All those who were building <span id="add-NEH.4.18" class="usx-add">the wall</span> had a dagger fastened to their side. The man who would blow the trumpet <span id="add-NEH.4.18" class="usx-add">if our enemies attacked</span> was standing at my side.</p>

Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem, and our other enemies heard <span id="add-NEH.6.1" class="usx-add">a report</span> that we had finished rebuilding the wall, and that now there were no more ◄gaps/places where the wall was not finished► (although we had not yet put the doors in the gates). <a href="#NEH.6.2"><sup id="NEH.6.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
So Sanballat and Geshem sent <span id="add-NEH.6.2" class="usx-add">a message</span> to me, in which they said “Come and talk with us at a place in Ono Plain <span id="add-NEH.6.2" class="usx-add">north of Jerusalem</span>.” But <span id="add-NEH.6.2" class="usx-add">I knew that</span> really they wanted to harm me <span id="add-NEH.6.2" class="usx-add">if I went there</span>.</p>
<p id="p-NEH.6.2" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#NEH.6.3"><sup id="NEH.6.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
So I sent messengers to them, to tell them, “I am doing an important work, and I cannot go down <span id="add-NEH.6.3" class="usx-add">there</span>. ◄Why should I stop doing this work just to go down to <span id="add-NEH.6.3" class="usx-add">talk with</span> you?/I do not want to stop doing this work just to go down to <span id="add-NEH.6.3" class="usx-add">talk with</span> you.►” [RHQ] <a href="#NEH.6.4"><sup id="NEH.6.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
They sent me the same message four times, and each time when I replied to them I said the same thing.</p>
<p id="p-NEH.6.4" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#NEH.6.5"><sup id="NEH.6.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
Then Sanballat sent one of his servants to me, bringing a fifth message. This one was written, but it was not sealed. <span id="add-NEH.6.5" class="usx-add">He did that in order that others would read the message that the servant was carrying</span> in his hand. <a href="#NEH.6.6"><sup id="NEH.6.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
This is what was written in the message:</p>
<p id="pi1-NEH.6.6" class="usx-pi1" >“Some people in the nearby countries have heard a report that you and the other Jews are rebuilding the wall <span id="add-NEH.6.6" class="usx-add">in order to be able to resist attacks</span>, because you are planning to revolt <span id="add-NEH.6.6" class="usx-add">against the king of Babylon</span>. And the report also says that you are planning to become the king <span id="add-NEH.6.6" class="usx-add">of the Israelis</span>. Geshem says that what they have reported is true. <a href="#NEH.6.7"><sup id="NEH.6.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
<span id="add-NEH.6.7" class="usx-add">People are also saying that</span> you have appointed some prophets to proclaim in Jerusalem that you, <span id="add-NEH.6.7" class="usx-add">Nehemiah,</span> are now the king in Judea. King <span id="add-NEH.6.7" class="usx-add">Artaxerxes</span> will certainly hear these reports, <span id="add-NEH.6.7" class="usx-add">and then you will be in big trouble</span>. So I suggest that we should meet together to talk about this matter.”</p>
<p id="p-NEH.6.7" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#NEH.6.8"><sup id="NEH.6.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>

    <span id="add-NEH.6.8" class="usx-add">When I read that message,</span> I sent <span id="add-NEH.6.8" class="usx-add">the messenger</span> back to Sanballat to say, “None of what you are saying is true. You have ◄made this up/concocted this► in your own head/mind.” <a href="#NEH.6.9"><sup id="NEH.6.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
<span id="add-NEH.6.9" class="usx-add">I said that because I knew that</span> they were trying to cause us to be afraid, with the result that we would stop working <span id="add-NEH.6.9" class="usx-add">on the wall</span>. So I actually became more determined (OR, I prayed to God to help me) <span id="add-NEH.6.9" class="usx-add">to continue the work</span>.</p>
<p id="p-NEH.6.9" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#NEH.6.10"><sup id="NEH.6.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>

    <span id="add-NEH.6.10" class="usx-add">One day</span> I went to talk with Shemaiah, son of Delaiah and grandson of Mehetabel. I went to talk with him in his house, because he was not able (OR, allowed) to leave his house. He said to me, “You and I must enter the very sacred place in the temple and lock the doors, because people are going to come to kill you at night.”</p>
<p id="p-NEH.6.10" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#NEH.6.11"><sup id="NEH.6.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
I replied, “I ◄am not that kind of person/do not do things like that► [RHQ]! I would not run and hide in the temple to save my life! No, I will not do that!” <a href="#NEH.6.12"><sup id="NEH.6.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
When I thought <span id="add-NEH.6.12" class="usx-add">about what he had said</span>, I realized that God had not told Shemaiah to say that to me. I realized that Tobiah and Sanballat had bribed him <span id="add-NEH.6.12" class="usx-add">to say that to me</span>. <a href="#NEH.6.13"><sup id="NEH.6.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
They had bribed him to cause me to be afraid. They wanted me to <span id="add-NEH.6.13" class="usx-add">disobey God’s commands and</span> sin <span id="add-NEH.6.13" class="usx-add">by hiding in the temple</span>. If I did that, they would be able to ruin my reputation [MTY] and discredit me.</p>
<p id="p-NEH.6.13" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#NEH.6.14"><sup id="NEH.6.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>

    <span id="add-NEH.6.14" class="usx-add">So I prayed,</span> “My God, do not forget what Tobiah and Sanballat have done. Punish them. And do not forget that the female prophet Noadiah and some of the other prophets have also tried to cause me to be afraid.”</p>
<p id="s1-NEH.6.14" class="usx-s1" >They finished building the wall</p>
<p id="p-NEH.6.14" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#NEH.6.15"><sup id="NEH.6.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
On October 2 we finished rebuilding the wall. We did it all in 52 days. <a href="#NEH.6.16"><sup id="NEH.6.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
When our enemies in the nearby countries heard about that, they realized that they had been humiliated, because everyone knew that it was because God helped us that we had been able to do this work <span id="add-NEH.6.16" class="usx-add">and that they had not been able to force us to quit</span>.</p>
<p id="p-NEH.6.16" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#NEH.6.17"><sup id="NEH.6.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
During this time, the Jewish leaders had been sending many messages/letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah had been sending messages back to them. <a href="#NEH.6.18"><sup id="NEH.6.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
Many people in Judea were closely associated with Tobiah, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah. Furthermore, Tobiah’s son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berekiah. <a href="#NEH.6.19"><sup id="NEH.6.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
People often talked in my presence about all the good things that Tobiah had done, and then they would tell him everything that I said. So Tobiah sent many letters to me to try to cause me to become afraid.</p>
<a href="#NEH.7"><h3 id="NEH.7" class="usx-c">7</h3></a>
<p id="p-NEH.7" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#NEH.7.1"><sup id="NEH.7.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
After the wall had been finished and we had put the gates in their places, we assigned to the temple guards and to the members of the <span id="add-NEH.7.1" class="usx-add">sacred</span> choir and the other descendants of Levi the work that they were to do. <a href="#NEH.7.2"><sup id="NEH.7.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
I appointed two men to <span id="add-NEH.7.2" class="usx-add">help me to</span> govern Jerusalem, my brother Hanani and Hananiah who was the commander of the fortress <span id="add-NEH.7.2" class="usx-add">in Jerusalem</span>. Hananiah always did his work reliably, and he revered God more than most other people do. <a href="#NEH.7.3"><sup id="NEH.7.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
I said to them, “Do not open the gates of Jerusalem until late each morning. And close the gates and put the bars across the doors <span id="add-NEH.7.3" class="usx-add">◄late in each afternoon/before sunset►</span> while the gatekeepers are still guarding the gates.” I also told them to appoint some people who lived in Jerusalem to be guards <span id="add-NEH.7.3" class="usx-add">on the wall</span>, and to assign some of them to be guards at certain other places and to assign others to guard the area close to their own houses.</p>
<p id="s1-NEH.7.3" class="usx-s1" >A list of those who returned to Jerusalem</p>
<p id="p-NEH.7.3" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#NEH.7.4"><sup id="NEH.7.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
The city <span id="add-NEH.7.4" class="usx-add">of Jerusalem</span> covered a large area, but <span id="add-NEH.7.4" class="usx-add">at that time</span> not many people lived in the city, and they had not built many new houses yet [HYP]. <a href="#NEH.7.5"><sup id="NEH.7.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
<span id="add-NEH.7.5" class="usx-add">To defend the city, we needed more people there.</span> Then God gave me the idea to summon the leaders and officials and <span id="add-NEH.7.5" class="usx-add">other</span> people, and to look in the books <span id="add-NEH.7.5" class="usx-add">in which were written the names</span> of all the people and their clans. So I found the records of the people who had first returned from Babylonia. This is what I found written in those records:</p>

Ezra, who taught people the laws of Moses, <span id="add-NEH.8.1-2" class="usx-add">had a scroll on which</span> the laws of Moses were written.

They also read from scrolls that contained the laws that God <span id="add-NEH.8.8" class="usx-add">gave to Moses</span>, and they interpreted <span id="add-NEH.8.8" class="usx-add">into the Aramaic language</span> what they read, making the meaning clear so that the people could understand the meaning.</p>

All of the Israeli people who had returned from Babylon built shelters and lived in them <span id="add-NEH.8.17" class="usx-add">for one week</span>. The Israeli people had not celebrated that festival like that since the time that Joshua lived. And they were very joyful.</p>

    <span id="add-NEH.12.30" class="usx-add">When they came to Jerusalem</span>, the priests and <span id="add-NEH.12.30" class="usx-add">other</span> descendants of Levi <span id="add-NEH.12.30" class="usx-add">who help the priests</span> performed rituals to cause themselves to be acceptable to God, and then they performed similar rituals to purify the <span id="add-NEH.12.30" class="usx-add">other</span> people, the gates, and the wall. <a href="#NEH.12.31"><sup id="NEH.12.31" class="usx-v">31</sup></a>
Then I gathered together the leaders of Judah on top of the wall, and I appointed them to lead two large groups to march around the city <span id="add-NEH.12.31" class="usx-add">on top of the wall</span>, thanking God. <span id="add-NEH.12.31" class="usx-add">As they faced the city,</span> one group walked to the right toward the Dung Gate. <a href="#NEH.12.32"><sup id="NEH.12.32" class="usx-v">32</sup></a>
Behind their leaders marched Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah. <a href="#NEH.12.33-35"><sup id="NEH.12.33-35" class="usx-v">33-35</sup></a>
Behind them marched a group of priests who were blowing trumpets. They were Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, and Jeremiah. Next came Zechariah, the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, a descendant of Asaph. <a href="#NEH.12.36"><sup id="NEH.12.36" class="usx-v">36</sup></a>
Behind them marched other members of Zechariah’s clan: Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani. They all were playing the same kinds of musical instruments that King David had played <span id="add-NEH.12.36" class="usx-add">many years previously</span>. Ezra, the man who knew the Jewish laws very well, marched in front of this group. <a href="#NEH.12.37"><sup id="NEH.12.37" class="usx-v">37</sup></a>
When they reached the Fountain Gate, they went up the steps to David’s City, past his palace, and then to the wall at the Water Gate, on the east side <span id="add-NEH.12.37" class="usx-add">of the city</span>.</p>
<p id="p-NEH.12.37" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#NEH.12.38"><sup id="NEH.12.38" class="usx-v">38</sup></a>
The other group of those who were thanking <span id="add-NEH.12.38" class="usx-add">Yahweh</span> marched to the left on top of the wall. I followed them with half of the people. <span id="add-NEH.12.38" class="usx-add">We marched</span> past the Tower of the Ovens to the Broad Wall. <a href="#NEH.12.39"><sup id="NEH.12.39" class="usx-v">39</sup></a>
<span id="add-NEH.12.39" class="usx-add">From there we marched</span> past Ephraim Gate, Jeshanah Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel, the Tower of the Hundred Soldiers, to the Sheep Gate. We finished marching near the gate into the temple. <a href="#NEH.12.40"><sup id="NEH.12.40" class="usx-v">40</sup></a>
Both the groups reached the temple while they were thanking God. They stood in their places there. The leaders who were with me <span id="add-NEH.12.40" class="usx-add">also stood with me in our places</span>.</p>
<p id="p-NEH.12.40" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#NEH.12.41"><sup id="NEH.12.41" class="usx-v">41</sup></a>
My group included these priests who were <span id="add-NEH.12.41" class="usx-add">all blowing</span> trumpets: Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, Hananiah, <a href="#NEH.12.42"><sup id="NEH.12.42" class="usx-v">42</sup></a>
<span id="add-NEH.12.42" class="usx-add">another</span> Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. The singers, whose leader was Jezrahiah, sang loudly. <a href="#NEH.12.43"><sup id="NEH.12.43" class="usx-v">43</sup></a>
<span id="add-NEH.12.43" class="usx-add">After we went outside the temple,</span> we offered many sacrifices. We men all rejoiced because God had caused us to be very happy. The women and the children also rejoiced. People far away could hear the noise that we made there in Jerusalem.</p>

On that day, men were appointed {they appointed men} to be in charge of the storerooms where they kept the money that people contributed <span id="add-NEH.12.44" class="usx-add">for the temple</span>. They also kept there <span id="add-NEH.12.44" class="usx-add">the other things that the people contributed—</span> the tithes and the first part of the grain and fruit that was harvested each year. Those men collected those things from the fields/farms near the cities, and <span id="add-NEH.12.44" class="usx-add">took them to Jerusalem and</span> gave them to the priests and the <span id="add-NEH.12.44" class="usx-add">other</span> descendants of Levi, as <span id="add-NEH.12.44" class="usx-add">Moses had said in his</span> laws that they should do. All the Israeli people were happy about the work that the priests and the descendants of Levi did, <a href="#NEH.12.45"><sup id="NEH.12.45" class="usx-v">45</sup></a>
because they performed the rituals to purify things, and the other rituals that God had commanded. The musicians in the temple also did their work as King David and his son Solomon had declared that they should do. <a href="#NEH.12.46"><sup id="NEH.12.46" class="usx-v">46</sup></a>
Ever since the time that David had been the king and Asaph had been his chief musician, the musicians had led the people while they sang songs to praise and thank God. <a href="#NEH.12.47"><sup id="NEH.12.47" class="usx-v">47</sup></a>
During the years that Zerubbabel and I governed the Israeli people, they all contributed the food that the singers and temple gatekeepers needed each day. They gave ◄a tithe/10%► of their crops to the descendants of Levi <span id="add-NEH.12.47" class="usx-add">who helped the priests</span>, and those descendants of Levi gave ◄a tithe/10%► of that to <span id="add-NEH.12.47" class="usx-add">the priests, who were</span> descendants of Aaron <span id="add-NEH.12.47" class="usx-add">the first Supreme Priest</span>.</p>

    <a href="#NEH.13.1"><sup id="NEH.13.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
On that day, when someone read to the people parts of the laws <span id="add-NEH.13.1" class="usx-add">that God gave</span> to Moses, they read where it was written that no one from the Ammon people-group or the Moab people-group was ever to be allowed to be with God’s people while they were gathered together <span id="add-NEH.13.1" class="usx-add">to worship</span>. <a href="#NEH.13.2"><sup id="NEH.13.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
The reason for that was that the people of Ammon and the people of Moab did not give/sell any food or water to the Israelis <span id="add-NEH.13.2" class="usx-add">while the Israelis were going through their areas after they left Egypt</span>. Instead, the people of Ammon and Moab paid money to Balaam in order that he would curse the Israelis. But God commanded Balaam to bless the people, not to curse them. <a href="#NEH.13.3"><sup id="NEH.13.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
So when the people heard these laws <span id="add-NEH.13.3" class="usx-add">being read to them</span>, they sent away all the people whose ancestors had come from other countries.</p>

    <a href="#NEH.13.4"><sup id="NEH.13.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
Previously, Eliashib the priest had been appointed to be in charge of the storerooms in the temple. He was a relative of <span id="add-NEH.13.4" class="usx-add">our enemy</span> Tobiah. <a href="#NEH.13.5"><sup id="NEH.13.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
He allowed Tobiah to use a large room in which they had previously stored the grain offerings and the incense, the equipment that is used in the temple, the offerings <span id="add-NEH.13.5" class="usx-add">that the people had brought</span> for the priests, and the tithes of grain and wine and <span id="add-NEH.13.5" class="usx-add">olive</span> oil that <span id="add-NEH.13.5" class="usx-add">God</span> had commanded the people to bring to the <span id="add-NEH.13.5" class="usx-add">other</span> descendants of Levi, and to the temple musicians, and to the temple guards.</p>
<p id="p-NEH.13.5" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#NEH.13.6"><sup id="NEH.13.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
While <span id="add-NEH.13.6" class="usx-add">Tobias was using that room</span>, I was not in Jerusalem, because in the 32nd year that Artaxerxes was the king of Babylonia, I went back there to report to him. After a while I requested the king to allow me to return to Jerusalem, <span id="add-NEH.13.6" class="usx-add">and he allowed me to go</span>. <a href="#NEH.13.7"><sup id="NEH.13.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
When I arrived in Jerusalem, I found out that Eliashib had done an evil thing by allowing Tobiah to use a room in God’s temple. <a href="#NEH.13.8"><sup id="NEH.13.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
I became very angry, and I threw out of that room everything that belonged to Tobiah. <a href="#NEH.13.9"><sup id="NEH.13.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
Then I commanded <span id="add-NEH.13.9" class="usx-add">that they perform a ritual</span> to make the rooms ◄pure/acceptable to God► again. And I also ordered that all the equipment used in the temple and all the grain offerings and incense should be put in that room again.</p>
<p id="p-NEH.13.9" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#NEH.13.10"><sup id="NEH.13.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
I also found out that the temple musicians and <span id="add-NEH.13.10" class="usx-add">other</span> descendants of Levi had left Jerusalem and returned to their fields/farms, because the Israeli people had not been bringing to them the food <span id="add-NEH.13.10" class="usx-add">that they needed</span>. <a href="#NEH.13.11"><sup id="NEH.13.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
So I rebuked the officials, saying to them, “◄Why have you not taken care of the work in the temple?/It is disgraceful that you have not taken care of the work in the temple.►” [RHQ] So I brought the descendants of Levi and the musicians back to the temple, and told them to do their work there again.</p>
<p id="p-NEH.13.11" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#NEH.13.12"><sup id="NEH.13.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
Then all the people of Judah again started to bring to the temple storerooms their tithes of grain, wine, and <span id="add-NEH.13.12" class="usx-add">olive</span> oil. <a href="#NEH.13.13"><sup id="NEH.13.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
I appointed these men to be in charge of the storerooms: Shelemiah, who was a priest; Zadok, who knew the Jewish laws very well; and Pedaiah, a descendant of Levi. I appointed Hanan, who is the son of Zaccur and grandson of Mattaniah, to assist them. I knew that I could trust these men while they distributed those offerings to their fellow workers.</p>
<p id="p-NEH.13.13" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#NEH.13.14"><sup id="NEH.13.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>

    <a href="#NEH.13.15"><sup id="NEH.13.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
During that time, I saw some people in Judea <span id="add-NEH.13.15" class="usx-add">who were working </span> on the Sabbath day. <span id="add-NEH.13.15" class="usx-add">Some were</span> pressing grapes <span id="add-NEH.13.15" class="usx-add">to make wine</span>. Others were putting grain, <span id="add-NEH.13.15" class="usx-add">bags of</span> wine, <span id="add-NEH.13.15" class="usx-add">baskets of</span> grapes, figs, and many [HYP] other things, on their donkeys and taking them into Jerusalem. I warned them that they should not sell things to the people of Judea on Sabbath days. <a href="#NEH.13.16"><sup id="NEH.13.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
I also saw some people from Tyre <span id="add-NEH.13.16" class="usx-add">city</span> who were living there in Jerusalem who were bringing fish and other things <span id="add-NEH.13.16" class="usx-add">into Jerusalem</span> to sell to the people of Judea on the Sabbath day. <a href="#NEH.13.17"><sup id="NEH.13.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
So I rebuked the Jewish leaders and told them, “This is [RHQ] a very evil thing that you are doing! You are causing the Sabbath days to be unholy. <a href="#NEH.13.18"><sup id="NEH.13.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
Your ancestors did [RHQ] things like that, so God punished them, and as a result, this city was destroyed! And now by causing the Sabbath day to be unholy, you are going to cause God to be angry with us Israeli people <span id="add-NEH.13.18" class="usx-add">and punish us</span> more!”</p>
<p id="p-NEH.13.18" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#NEH.13.19"><sup id="NEH.13.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
So I ordered that at ◄the beginning of every Sabbath day/every Friday evening► they should shut the gates of the city before it became dark. I also ordered that they should not open the gates until ◄the Sabbath day was ended <span id="add-NEH.13.19" class="usx-add">the next day</span>/Saturday evening►. Then <span id="add-NEH.13.19" class="usx-add">each Sabbath day</span> I put some of my men at the gates, so they would make sure that nothing to sell was brought into the city on that day. <a href="#NEH.13.20"><sup id="NEH.13.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
One or two times merchants [DOU] stayed outside of the city on ◄Friday night/<span id="add-NEH.13.20" class="usx-add">the night before the Sabbath day</span>►. <a href="#NEH.13.21"><sup id="NEH.13.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
I warned them, “It is useless [RHQ] for you to stay here outside the walls <span id="add-NEH.13.21" class="usx-add">on Friday night</span>! If you do this again, I will tell my men to arrest you!” So after that, they did not come on Sabbath days. <a href="#NEH.13.22"><sup id="NEH.13.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
I also commanded the descendants of Levi to <span id="add-NEH.13.22" class="usx-add">perform the ritual to</span> purify themselves and to guard the city gates, to make sure that the Sabbath was kept holy <span id="add-NEH.13.22" class="usx-add">by not allowing merchants to enter it on Sabbath days</span>.</p>
<p id="p-NEH.13.22" class="usx-p" >My God, do not forget this also that I <span id="add-NEH.13.22" class="usx-add">have done for you</span>! And because of your faithfully loving me, allow me to continue to live <span id="add-NEH.13.22" class="usx-add">many more years</span>!</p>
<p id="p-NEH.13.22" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#NEH.13.23"><sup id="NEH.13.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
During that time, I also found out that many of the Jewish men had married women from Ashdod <span id="add-NEH.13.23" class="usx-add">city</span>, and from <span id="add-NEH.13.23" class="usx-add">the</span> Ammon and Moab <span id="add-NEH.13.23" class="usx-add">people-groups</span>. <a href="#NEH.13.24"><sup id="NEH.13.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
The result was that half of their children spoke the language that people in Ashdod speak or some other language, and they didn’t know how to speak our language. <a href="#NEH.13.25"><sup id="NEH.13.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
So I rebuked those men, and I <span id="add-NEH.13.25" class="usx-add">asked God to</span> curse them, and I beat them and pulled out <span id="add-NEH.13.25" class="usx-add">some of</span> their hair. Then I forced them to solemnly promise, knowing that God [MTY] was <span id="add-NEH.13.25" class="usx-add">listening</span>, that they would never again marry foreigners, and never allow their children to marry foreigners. <a href="#NEH.13.26"><sup id="NEH.13.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
<span id="add-NEH.13.26" class="usx-add">I said to them</span>, “Solomon, the king of Israel, sinned [RHQ] as a result of <span id="add-NEH.13.26" class="usx-add">marrying</span> foreign women.

    <a href="#NEH.13.29"><sup id="NEH.13.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>
My God, do not forget that those people <span id="add-NEH.13.29" class="usx-add">who have married foreign women</span> have caused it to be a shame/disgrace to be a priest, and have caused people to despise the agreement that you made with the priests and with the <span id="add-NEH.13.29" class="usx-add">other</span> descendants of Levi <span id="add-NEH.13.29" class="usx-add">who help the priests</span>►!</p>

    <a href="#NEH.13.30"><sup id="NEH.13.30" class="usx-v">30</sup></a>
I did all that to make sure that there were no more foreign people among the <span id="add-NEH.13.30" class="usx-add">Israeli</span> people <span id="add-NEH.13.30" class="usx-add">who would encourage them to worship idols</span>.
