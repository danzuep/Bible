After Saul died, David <span id="add-2SA.1.1" class="usx-add">and the men who were with him</span> returned to Ziklag <span id="add-2SA.1.1" class="usx-add">town</span> after defeating the descendants of Amalek.

On the third day, unexpectedly a man arrived there who had come from where Saul’s army was camped. He had torn his clothes and put dust on his head <span id="add-2SA.1.2" class="usx-add">to show that he was grieving</span>. He came to David, and prostrated himself on the ground <span id="add-2SA.1.2" class="usx-add">in front of David to show respect for him</span>.</p>
<p id="p-2SA.1.2" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2SA.1.3"><sup id="2SA.1.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
David asked him, “Where have you come from?” The man replied, “I escaped from where the Israeli army had been camped.”</p>
<p id="p-2SA.1.3" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2SA.1.4"><sup id="2SA.1.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
David asked him, “What happened? Tell me <span id="add-2SA.1.4" class="usx-add">about the battle</span>!” The man replied, “The Israeli soldiers ran away from the battle. Many of them were killed. And Saul and his son Jonathan ◄are dead/were also killed►.”</p>
<p id="p-2SA.1.4" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2SA.1.5"><sup id="2SA.1.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
David said to the young man, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?”</p>
<p id="p-2SA.1.5" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2SA.1.6"><sup id="2SA.1.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
The young man replied, “It happened that I was on Gilboa Mountain <span id="add-2SA.1.6" class="usx-add">where the battle occurred</span>, and I saw Saul, leaning on his spear. The <span id="add-2SA.1.6" class="usx-add">enemy</span> chariots and their drivers had come very close to Saul. <a href="#2SA.1.7"><sup id="2SA.1.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Saul turned around and saw me, and he called out to me. I answered him and said, ‘What do you want me to do?’</p>
<p id="p-2SA.1.7" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2SA.1.8"><sup id="2SA.1.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
He replied, ‘Who are you?’ I replied, ‘I am a descendant of Amalek.’</p>
<p id="p-2SA.1.8" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2SA.1.9"><sup id="2SA.1.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
Then he said to me, ‘Come over here and kill me. I am still alive, but I am enduring a lot of pain.’</p>
<p id="p-2SA.1.9" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2SA.1.10"><sup id="2SA.1.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
So I went to him and killed him, because I knew that he was wounded very badly and would ◄not continue to live/soon die►. I took the crown that was on his head and the band/bracelet that was on his arm, and I have brought them to you.”</p>
<p id="p-2SA.1.10" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2SA.1.11"><sup id="2SA.1.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
Then David and all the men who were with him tore their clothes <span id="add-2SA.1.11" class="usx-add">to show that they were very sad</span>. <a href="#2SA.1.12"><sup id="2SA.1.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
They mourned for Saul and his son Jonathan, and they cried and ◄fasted/abstained from eating food► until it was evening. They also mourned for all the army of Yahweh, and for all the Israeli people, because many of their soldiers had been killed in the battle [MTY].</p>
<p id="p-2SA.1.12" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2SA.1.13"><sup id="2SA.1.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Then David asked the young man who had told him <span id="add-2SA.1.13" class="usx-add">about the battle</span>, “Where are you from?” He replied, “My father is a descendant of Amalek, but we live in Israel.”</p>
<p id="p-2SA.1.13" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2SA.1.14"><sup id="2SA.1.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
David asked him, “◄Why were you not afraid <span id="add-2SA.1.14" class="usx-add">that you would be punished if you</span> killed Saul, whom Yahweh had appointed [MTY] <span id="add-2SA.1.14" class="usx-add">to be the king</span>?/You should have been afraid <span id="add-2SA.1.14" class="usx-add">that you would be punished if you</span> killed Saul, whom Yahweh had appointed [MTY] <span id="add-2SA.1.14" class="usx-add">to be the king</span>.► [RHQ] <a href="#2SA.1.15-16"><sup id="2SA.1.15-16" class="usx-v">15-16</sup></a>
You yourself said, ‘I killed the man whom Yahweh appointed to be the king.’ So you have caused yourself to be guilty [MTY] of causing your own death!” Then David summoned one of his soldiers and said to him, “Kill him!” So the soldier killed him by striking him <span id="add-2SA.1.15-16" class="usx-add">with a sword</span>.</p>

    <a href="#2SA.1.17"><sup id="2SA.1.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
Then David composed/wrote this sad song about Saul and Jonathan, <a href="#2SA.1.18"><sup id="2SA.1.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>

Some time after that, David asked Yahweh, “Should I go back to <span id="add-2SA.2.1" class="usx-add">live in</span> one of the towns in Judah?” Yahweh replied, “Yes, go up there.” Then David asked, “To which town should I go?” Yahweh replied, “To Hebron.”</p>

Ishbosheth was 40 years old when he started to rule over the people of Israel. He ruled them for two years. But the tribe of Judah ◄was loyal to David/wanted David to be their king►, <a href="#2SA.2.11"><sup id="2SA.2.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>

Joab, whose mother was Zeruiah, and some of David’s officials <span id="add-2SA.2.13" class="usx-add">went from Hebron to Gibeon, and</span> met at the pool there. They all sat down, the one group on one side of the pool and the other group on the other side.</p>

    <a href="#2SA.2.15"><sup id="2SA.2.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
So twelve men from the tribe of Benjamin fought for Ishbosheth, against twelve of David’s soldiers. <a href="#2SA.2.16"><sup id="2SA.2.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
Each of them grabbed the head of the man against whom he was fighting, and thrust his sword into that man’s side. The result was that all 24 of them fell down dead. So that area in Gibeon is now called ‘Field of Swords’.</p>

But Asahel refused to stop pursuing Abner. So Abner <span id="add-2SA.2.23" class="usx-add">suddenly turned and</span> thrust the butt end of his spear into Asahel’s stomach.

Afterwards, Abner said to David, “Sir/Your majesty, I will now go and encourage all the people of Israel to accept you to be their king, as you have desired.” Then Abner left, peacefully.</p>

So when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab met him at the city gate, and took him aside as though he wanted to speak with him privately.

    <span id="add-2SA.5.6" class="usx-add">One day</span> King David and his soldiers went to Jerusalem to fight against the Jebus people-group who lived there.

Even the blind and crippled people will be able to chase you away!” <a href="#2SA.5.7"><sup id="2SA.5.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
But David’s army captured the fortress on Zion <span id="add-2SA.5.7" class="usx-add">Hill</span>, <span id="add-2SA.5.7" class="usx-add">and later it was known as</span> David’s City. <a href="#2SA.5.8"><sup id="2SA.5.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>

His doing that caused David to realize that Yahweh truly had appointed him to be the king of Israel, and that Yahweh was going to cause his kingdom to prosper, because Yahweh loved the Israeli people, whom <span id="add-2SA.5.12" class="usx-add">he had chosen to</span> belong to him.</p>

When the Philistia people heard that David had been appointed to be the king of Israel, their army went up <span id="add-2SA.5.17" class="usx-add">toward Jerusalem</span> to try to capture David.

The <span id="add-2SA.5.18" class="usx-add">army of</span> Philistia arrived at Rephaim Valley <span id="add-2SA.5.18" class="usx-add">southwest of Jerusalem</span> and spread all over the valley. <a href="#2SA.5.19"><sup id="2SA.5.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
David asked Yahweh, “Should <span id="add-2SA.5.19" class="usx-add">my men and</span> I attack the Philistia army? Will you enable us to defeat them [IDM]?” Yahweh replied, “Yes, attack them, because I will certainly enable your army to defeat them. [IDM]”</p>

The Philistia men left their idols there; so David and his soldiers took them away.</p>

So again David asked Yahweh <span id="add-2SA.5.23" class="usx-add">if his army should attack them</span>.

When you hear something in the tops of the balsam trees that sounds like <span id="add-2SA.5.24" class="usx-add">an army</span> marching, attack them, because I will have gone ahead of you <span id="add-2SA.5.24" class="usx-add">to enable your army</span> to defeat their army.” <a href="#2SA.5.25"><sup id="2SA.5.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
So David did what Yahweh told him to do, and his <span id="add-2SA.5.25" class="usx-add">army</span> defeated the Philistia army from Geba <span id="add-2SA.5.25" class="usx-add">city</span> all the way <span id="add-2SA.5.25" class="usx-add">west</span> to Gezer <span id="add-2SA.5.25" class="usx-add">city</span>.</p>

Then David chose 30,000 Israeli men and gathered them together. <a href="#2SA.6.2"><sup id="2SA.6.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
He led them to the place in Judah <span id="add-2SA.6.2" class="usx-add">formerly</span> called Baalah, <span id="add-2SA.6.2" class="usx-add">now called Kiriath-Jearim</span>. They went in order to bring from there <span id="add-2SA.6.2" class="usx-add">to Jerusalem</span> the sacred chest, which had the name of Yahweh, the leader of the armies of <span id="add-2SA.6.2" class="usx-add">the angels in</span> heaven, written on it, and which had the <span id="add-2SA.6.2" class="usx-add">statues of the</span> winged creatures on top of it. Between those statues was where Yahweh spoke messages about ruling his people [MTY]. <a href="#2SA.6.3"><sup id="2SA.6.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
The sacred chest was in the house of Abinadab, on top of a hill. They went there, and they put the chest on a new cart. Uzzah and Ahio, the two sons of Abinadab, were guiding <span id="add-2SA.6.3" class="usx-add">the oxen that were pulling the cart</span>. <a href="#2SA.6.4"><sup id="2SA.6.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
Uzzah walked alongside the cart, and Ahio walked in front of it. <a href="#2SA.6.5"><sup id="2SA.6.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
David and all the Israeli men were celebrating in God’s presence, singing with all their strength and <span id="add-2SA.6.5" class="usx-add">playing</span> lyres and harps, and beating tambourines, and clashing castanets and cymbals.</p>

But when they came to the place where Nacon threshed grain, the oxen stumbled. So Uzzah put his hand on the sacred chest to ◄steady it/prevent it from falling <span id="add-2SA.6.6" class="usx-add">off the cart</span>►. <a href="#2SA.6.7"><sup id="2SA.6.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Yahweh immediately became very angry with Uzzah, and he killed him right there alongside the sacred chest, because he had touched the chest, <span id="add-2SA.6.7" class="usx-add">and Yahweh had commanded that only the descendants of Levi who help the priests should touch the sacred chest</span>.</p>
<p id="p-2SA.6.7" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2SA.6.8"><sup id="2SA.6.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
David was angry because Yahweh had punished Uzzah. So ever since that time, that place has been called ‘The Punishment of Uzzah’.</p>

    <a href="#2SA.6.9"><sup id="2SA.6.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
David was <span id="add-2SA.6.9" class="usx-add">also</span> afraid of <span id="add-2SA.6.9" class="usx-add">what else</span> Yahweh <span id="add-2SA.6.9" class="usx-add">would do to punish them</span>, so he said, “◄How can I take the sacred chest with me <span id="add-2SA.6.9" class="usx-add">to Jerusalem</span>?/I am afraid to take the sacred chest with me <span id="add-2SA.6.9" class="usx-add">to Jerusalem</span>.►” [RHQ] <a href="#2SA.6.10"><sup id="2SA.6.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
So he did not want to take the sacred chest to Jerusalem. Instead, they took it to another place; they took it to the house of Obed-Edom, from Gath <span id="add-2SA.6.10" class="usx-add">city</span>. <a href="#2SA.6.11"><sup id="2SA.6.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
They left the sacred chest in the house of Obed-Edom for three months, and <span id="add-2SA.6.11" class="usx-add">during that time</span> Yahweh blessed Obed-Edom and his family.</p>

    <a href="#2SA.6.12"><sup id="2SA.6.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
Later, people told David, “Yahweh has blessed Obed-Edom and his family because <span id="add-2SA.6.12" class="usx-add">he is taking care</span> of the sacred chest!” When David heard that, he <span id="add-2SA.6.12" class="usx-add">and some other men</span> went to Obed-Edom’s house, and very joyfully brought the sacred chest from there to Jerusalem. <a href="#2SA.6.13"><sup id="2SA.6.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
<span id="add-2SA.6.13" class="usx-add">This time, descendants of Levi</span> were carrying the sacred chest, but when they had walked only six steps, they stopped, and there David killed a bull and a fat calf, and offered them to Yahweh for a sacrifice. <a href="#2SA.6.14"><sup id="2SA.6.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
David was wearing <span id="add-2SA.6.14" class="usx-add">only</span> a linen cloth wrapped around his waist, and was dancing very energetically to honor Yahweh. <a href="#2SA.6.15"><sup id="2SA.6.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
David and the Israeli men took the sacred chest up <span id="add-2SA.6.15" class="usx-add">to Jerusalem</span>, shouting <span id="add-2SA.6.15" class="usx-add">loudly</span> and blowing trumpets.</p>

    <a href="#2SA.6.16"><sup id="2SA.6.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
While they were carrying the sacred chest into the city, <span id="add-2SA.6.16" class="usx-add">David’s wife</span> Michal, who was Saul’s daughter, looked out the window <span id="add-2SA.6.16" class="usx-add">of her house</span>.

    <a href="#2SA.6.17"><sup id="2SA.6.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
They brought the sacred chest into the tent that David had erected for it.

When David had finished offering those sacrifices, he asked Yahweh, the Commander of the armies <span id="add-2SA.6.18" class="usx-add">of the angels</span>, to bless the people. <a href="#2SA.6.19"><sup id="2SA.6.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
He also distributed food to all the people. To each Israeli man and woman he gave a loaf of bread, some meat, and a raisin cake. Then all the people returned to their homes.</p>

    <a href="#2SA.6.20"><sup id="2SA.6.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
When David went home to <span id="add-2SA.6.20" class="usx-add">ask Yahweh to</span> bless his family, his wife Michal came out to meet him.

It <span id="add-2SA.12.30" class="usx-add">was very heavy; it</span> weighed ◄75 pounds/34 kg.►, and it had many very valuable stones fastened to it. His soldiers also took many other valuable things from the city. <a href="#2SA.12.31"><sup id="2SA.12.31" class="usx-v">31</sup></a>
Then they brought the people of Rabbah out of the city and forced them to <span id="add-2SA.12.31" class="usx-add">work for them</span> using saws and iron picks and axes. David’s troops also forced them to make bricks. David’s soldiers did this in all the towns of the Ammon people-group. Then David and all of his army returned to Jerusalem.</p>

David’s son Absalom had a beautiful sister named Tamar. Another of David’s sons, Amnon, was attracted to Tamar. <a href="#2SA.13.2"><sup id="2SA.13.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
He wanted <span id="add-2SA.13.2" class="usx-add">to have sex with</span> [EUP] his half-sister very much, with the result that he made himself sick <span id="add-2SA.13.2" class="usx-add">thinking about her all the time</span>. But it was not possible for Amnon to get her, because she was a virgin, <span id="add-2SA.13.2" class="usx-add">so they kept men away from her</span>.</p>
<p id="p-2SA.13.2" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2SA.13.3"><sup id="2SA.13.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
But Amnon had a friend named Jonadab, who was the son of David’s brother Shimeah. Jonadab was a very crafty/shrewd man.</p>
<p id="p-2SA.13.3" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2SA.13.4"><sup id="2SA.13.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>

    <span id="add-2SA.13.4" class="usx-add">One day</span> Jonadab said to Amnon, “You are the king’s son, but every day I see that [RHQ] you seem very depressed/sad. What is your problem?” Amnon replied, “I ◄am in love/want to sleep► [EUP] with Tamar, my half-brother Absalom’s sister.”</p>
<p id="p-2SA.13.4" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2SA.13.5"><sup id="2SA.13.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
Jonadab said to him, “Lie down on your bed, and pretend that you are sick. When your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘Allow my half-sister Tamar to come and give me some food to eat. She can prepare the food while I am watching her. Then she can serve it to me herself.’”</p>
<p id="p-2SA.13.5" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2SA.13.6"><sup id="2SA.13.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
So Amnon lay down, and pretended that he was sick. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to him, “<span id="add-2SA.13.6" class="usx-add">I am sick;</span> please allow my half-sister Tamar to come and make a couple scones/dumplings for me while I am watching, and then she can serve them to me.”</p>

    <a href="#2SA.13.7"><sup id="2SA.13.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
So David sent a message to Tamar in the palace, saying “Amnon <span id="add-2SA.13.7" class="usx-add">is sick and he wants you to</span> go to his house and prepare some food for him.” <a href="#2SA.13.8"><sup id="2SA.13.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
So Tamar went to Amnon’s house, where he was lying in bed. She took some dough and kneaded it, and formed it into some scones/dumplings while he was watching her. Then she baked them. <a href="#2SA.13.9"><sup id="2SA.13.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
She took them out of the pan and put them <span id="add-2SA.13.9" class="usx-add">on a plate</span> in front of him, but he refused to eat them. Then he said to everyone else in the room, “All the rest of you, leave me now!” So all the others left his <span id="add-2SA.13.9" class="usx-add">room</span>.</p>

    <a href="#2SA.13.10"><sup id="2SA.13.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food into my room and serve it to me.” So Tamar took into his room the scones/dumplings that she had made. <a href="#2SA.13.11"><sup id="2SA.13.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
But when she brought them close for him to eat them, he grabbed her and said to her, “Come to bed with me!”</p>

As for me, if I did that, I would not be able to [RHQ] endure being disgraced by having done that. And as for you, everyone in Israel would condemn you for having done such a disgraceful deed. So I plead with you, talk to the king. I am sure that he will allow me to marry you.” <a href="#2SA.13.14"><sup id="2SA.13.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
But he would not listen to her. He was stronger than she was, so he forced her to have sex with him.</p>

    <a href="#2SA.13.15"><sup id="2SA.13.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
Then Amnon hated her very much. He hated her much more than he had desired her. He said to her, “Get up and get out of here!”</p>
<p id="p-2SA.13.15" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2SA.13.16"><sup id="2SA.13.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
But she said to him, “No! It would be very wrong for you to send me away. It would be worse than what you just did to me!” But he would not listen to her.</p>
<p id="p-2SA.13.16" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2SA.13.17"><sup id="2SA.13.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
He summoned his personal servant and said to him, “Take this woman outside, away from me, and lock the door <span id="add-2SA.13.17" class="usx-add">so that she cannot come in again</span>!” <a href="#2SA.13.18"><sup id="2SA.13.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
So the servant put her outside and locked the door.</p>
<p id="p-2SA.13.18" class="usx-p" >Tamar was wearing a long robe with long sleeves, which was the clothing that was usually worn by the unmarried daughters of the king at that time. <a href="#2SA.13.19"><sup id="2SA.13.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
But Tamar tore the long robe that she was wearing, and put ashes on her head <span id="add-2SA.13.19" class="usx-add">to show that she was very sad</span>. Then she put her hands on her head <span id="add-2SA.13.19" class="usx-add">to show that she was grieving</span>, and she went away, crying.</p>
<p id="p-2SA.13.19" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2SA.13.20"><sup id="2SA.13.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
Her brother Absalom <span id="add-2SA.13.20" class="usx-add">saw her and</span> said to her, “Has your half-brother Amnon [DOU] forced you to have sex with him [EUP]? Please, my sister, do not tell anyone, and do not become depressed/sad.” So Tamar went to live in Absalom’s house, and she was very sad and lonely.</p>
<p id="p-2SA.13.20" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2SA.13.21"><sup id="2SA.13.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
When King David heard about all that, he became very angry. <a href="#2SA.13.22"><sup id="2SA.13.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
And Absalom hated Amnon, because he had raped his sister, so he would not speak to Amnon about anything.</p>

    <a href="#2SA.13.23"><sup id="2SA.13.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
Two years later, Absalom’s servants were shearing sheep at Baal-Hazor, which is near <span id="add-2SA.13.23" class="usx-add">a town named</span> Ephraim. <span id="add-2SA.13.23" class="usx-add">When they finished shearing the sheep, they celebrated</span>, and Absalom invited all the king’s sons <span id="add-2SA.13.23" class="usx-add">to come and celebrate</span>. <a href="#2SA.13.24"><sup id="2SA.13.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
Absalom went to the king and said to him, “Sir, my servants have been shearing my sheep. Please come with your officials <span id="add-2SA.13.24" class="usx-add">to celebrate</span> with us!”</p>
<p id="p-2SA.13.24" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2SA.13.25"><sup id="2SA.13.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
But the king replied, “No, my son, it would not be good for all of us to go, because it would cause you to do a lot of work and spend a lot of money for food.” Absalom continued urging him, but the king would not go. Instead, he said that he hoped/desired that God would bless them <span id="add-2SA.13.25" class="usx-add">while they celebrated</span>.</p>
<p id="p-2SA.13.25" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2SA.13.26"><sup id="2SA.13.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
Then Absalom said, “If you will not go, please allow my half-brother Amnon to go with us.” But the king replied, “Why <span id="add-2SA.13.26" class="usx-add">do you want</span> him to go with you?”</p>
<p id="p-2SA.13.26" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2SA.13.27"><sup id="2SA.13.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
But Absalom continued to insist, so finally the king permitted Amnon and all David’s other sons to go with Absalom.</p>
<p id="p-2SA.13.27" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2SA.13.28"><sup id="2SA.13.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>

    <span id="add-2SA.13.28" class="usx-add">So they all went. And at the celebration</span>, Absalom commanded his servants, “Notice when Amnon has become a bit drunk from the wine. Then when I signal to you, kill him. Do not be afraid; you will be doing this <span id="add-2SA.13.28" class="usx-add">only</span> because I told you [RHQ] to do it. So be courageous and do it!” <a href="#2SA.13.29"><sup id="2SA.13.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>
So Absalom’s servants did what Absalom told them to do. <span id="add-2SA.13.29" class="usx-add">They killed Amnon</span>. All the rest of David’s sons <span id="add-2SA.13.29" class="usx-add">saw what happened and</span> fled, riding on their mules.</p>

    <a href="#2SA.13.30"><sup id="2SA.13.30" class="usx-v">30</sup></a>
While they were on their way home, someone <span id="add-2SA.13.30" class="usx-add">went quickly and</span> reported to David, “Absalom has killed all of your other sons; none of them is still alive!” <a href="#2SA.13.31"><sup id="2SA.13.31" class="usx-v">31</sup></a>
The king stood up, tore his clothes <span id="add-2SA.13.31" class="usx-add">because he was extremely sad</span>, and then he threw himself down on the ground. All the servants who were there also tore their clothes.</p>

    <a href="#2SA.13.32"><sup id="2SA.13.32" class="usx-v">32</sup></a>
But Jonadab, the son of David’s brother Shimeah, said, “Your Majesty, <span id="add-2SA.13.32" class="usx-add">I am sure that</span> they have not killed all your sons. <span id="add-2SA.13.32" class="usx-add">I am sure that</span> only Amnon is dead, because Absalom has determined to do this ever since the day that Amnon raped [EUP] his half-sister Tamar. <a href="#2SA.13.33"><sup id="2SA.13.33" class="usx-v">33</sup></a>
So, your majesty, do not believe the report that all your sons are dead. <span id="add-2SA.13.33" class="usx-add">I am sure that</span> only Amnon is dead.”</p>

In the meantime, Absalom ran away.</p>

Jonadab said to the king, “Aha! What I told you is true. Your other sons <span id="add-2SA.13.35" class="usx-add">are alive and</span> have come!”</p>

And as soon as he said that, David’s sons came in. They all started crying, and David and all his officials also cried very much.</p>

Joab realized that the king yearned [IDM] to see Absalom. <a href="#2SA.14.2"><sup id="2SA.14.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>

And go to the king, and tell him what I tell you to say.” Then Joab told her what to say [MTY] <span id="add-2SA.14.3" class="usx-add">to the king</span>.</p>

Now, all my family oppose me. They are insisting that I allow them to kill my son who is still alive [MTY], in order that they may get revenge for his killing his brother.

Then Joab got up and went to Geshur, and got Absalom and brought him back to Jerusalem. <a href="#2SA.14.24"><sup id="2SA.14.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
But the king said/commanded that Absalom would not be permitted to live in the palace. He said, “I do not want him to come to see me.” So Absalom lived in his own house, and did not go to <span id="add-2SA.14.24" class="usx-add">talk to</span> the king.</p>

Absalom was very handsome. He looked perfect, from the bottom of his feet to the top of his head. In all of Israel there was no one whom people admired more than Absalom. <a href="#2SA.14.26"><sup id="2SA.14.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
His hair was very thick, and he cut it only once each year, when it became too heavy for him. Using the standard weights, he would weigh the hair <span id="add-2SA.14.26" class="usx-add">that he cut off</span>, and it always weighed about five pounds. <a href="#2SA.14.27"><sup id="2SA.14.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
Absalom had three sons and one daughter named Tamar. She was a very beautiful woman.</p>

So he sent <span id="add-2SA.14.29" class="usx-add">a messenger</span> to Joab to ask him to come <span id="add-2SA.14.29" class="usx-add">and talk to him</span>, but Joab refused to come.

Then Absalom said to his servants, “You know that Joab’s field is next to mine, and that he has barley <span id="add-2SA.14.30" class="usx-add">growing</span> there.

Joab <span id="add-2SA.14.31" class="usx-add">knew who had done it, so he</span> went to Absalom’s house and said to him, “Why have your servants burned <span id="add-2SA.14.31" class="usx-add">the barley in</span> my field?” <a href="#2SA.14.32"><sup id="2SA.14.32" class="usx-v">32</sup></a>
Absalom replied, “Because <span id="add-2SA.14.32" class="usx-add">you did not come to me when</span> I sent messages to you <span id="add-2SA.14.32" class="usx-add">requesting that you come</span>.

So Joab went to the king, and told him <span id="add-2SA.14.33" class="usx-add">what Absalom had said</span>. Then the king <span id="add-2SA.14.33" class="usx-add">summoned Absalom</span>, and he came to the king and knelt down in front of him with his face touching the ground.

Some time later, Absalom acquired a chariot and horses <span id="add-2SA.15.1" class="usx-add">to pull it</span>. He <span id="add-2SA.15.1" class="usx-add">hired</span> 50 men to run in front of him <span id="add-2SA.15.1" class="usx-add">to honor him while he was riding around Jerusalem in the chariot</span>. <a href="#2SA.15.2"><sup id="2SA.15.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
Furthermore, he always rose early <span id="add-2SA.15.2" class="usx-add">each morning</span> and stood by the city gate.

Absalom would say to him, “Listen, <span id="add-2SA.15.3" class="usx-add">I am sure that</span> what you are saying/claiming is right.

Absalom would then add, “I wish that I were a judge in this land. If I were a judge, anyone who had a dispute could come to me, and I would decide it fairly/justly.”</p>

Absalom did this to everyone in Israel who came to the king because of having a dispute with someone. In that way, Absalom persuaded all the Israeli people to be more pleased with him [IDM] <span id="add-2SA.15.6" class="usx-add">than they were pleased with David</span>.</p>

Ahithophel was one of the king’s advisors. So the number of people who joined Absalom and who were ready to rebel <span id="add-2SA.15.12" class="usx-add">against David</span> became larger.</p>

While that was happening, Absalom and all the Israeli people who were with him had arrived in Jerusalem. Ahithophel had also arrived there. <a href="#2SA.16.16"><sup id="2SA.16.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
When David’s friend Hushai came to Absalom, he said to Absalom, “I desire/hope that the king will live a long time! May you live for many years!”</p>
<p id="p-2SA.16.16" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2SA.16.17"><sup id="2SA.16.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
Absalom said to Hushai, “You have been loyal [RHQ] to your friend <span id="add-2SA.16.17" class="usx-add">David for a long time</span>. So why did you not go with him <span id="add-2SA.16.17" class="usx-add">instead of coming to me</span>?”</p>
<p id="p-2SA.16.17" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2SA.16.18"><sup id="2SA.16.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
Hushai replied, “I will serve the one whom Yahweh and these people and all the other people of Israel have chosen <span id="add-2SA.16.18" class="usx-add">to be their king</span>. So I will stay with you. <a href="#2SA.16.19"><sup id="2SA.16.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
You are my master <span id="add-2SA.16.19" class="usx-add">King David’s</span> son; if I do not serve you, what other man should I serve [RHQ]? I will serve you as I served your father.”</p>
<p id="p-2SA.16.19" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2SA.16.20"><sup id="2SA.16.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “What do you advise that we should do?”</p>

    <a href="#2SA.16.21"><sup id="2SA.16.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
Ahithophel replied, “Your father left some of his slave wives in the palace to take care of it. Have sex [EUP] with them. When everyone in Israel hears that you have done that, they will realize that you are acting very contemptuously toward your father. Then all those who are with you will be very encouraged.” <a href="#2SA.16.22"><sup id="2SA.16.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
So they set up a tent for Absalom on the roof <span id="add-2SA.16.22" class="usx-add">of the palace</span>. And Absalom went into the tent and had sex [EUP] with his father’s slave wives, <span id="add-2SA.16.22" class="usx-add">one by one,</span> and everyone [HYP] could see <span id="add-2SA.16.22" class="usx-add">him going into the tent</span>.</p>

    <a href="#2SA.16.23"><sup id="2SA.16.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
In those days, people accepted what Ahithophel recommended as though he were speaking the words of God. So just as David had always accepted what Ahithophel said, now Absalom did also.</p>
<a href="#2SA.17"><h3 id="2SA.17" class="usx-c">17</h3></a>
<p id="p-2SA.17" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2SA.17.1"><sup id="2SA.17.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
Then Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Allow me to choose 12,000 men, and I will leave <span id="add-2SA.17.1" class="usx-add">with them</span> tonight to pursue David. <a href="#2SA.17.2"><sup id="2SA.17.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
We will attack him while he is tired and discouraged, and cause him to be very frightened. All the soldiers who are with him will run away. We will kill only the king. <a href="#2SA.17.3"><sup id="2SA.17.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
Then we will bring back all his soldiers to you, like [SIM] a ◄bride/woman comes to her husband when she is married►. You are wanting to kill only one man; so the other people will not be harmed.” <a href="#2SA.17.4"><sup id="2SA.17.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
Absalom and all the Israeli leaders <span id="add-2SA.17.4" class="usx-add">who were with him</span> thought that what Ahithophel said would be good to do.</p>

    <a href="#2SA.17.5"><sup id="2SA.17.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
But Absalom said, “Summon Hushai also, and we will hear what he suggests.” <a href="#2SA.17.6"><sup id="2SA.17.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
So when Hushai arrived, Absalom told him what Ahithophel had suggested. Then he asked Hushai, “What do you think we should do? If you do not think that we should do what Ahithophel suggests, tell us <span id="add-2SA.17.6" class="usx-add">what you think that we should do</span>.”</p>
<p id="p-2SA.17.6" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2SA.17.7"><sup id="2SA.17.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Hushai replied, “This time what Ahithophel has suggested is not good advice. <a href="#2SA.17.8"><sup id="2SA.17.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
You know that your father and the men who are with him are strong soldiers, and that now they are very angry, like [SIM] a mother bear whose cubs have been stolen from her. Furthermore, your father knows how to fight because he has fought in many battles. He will not stay with his troops during the night. <a href="#2SA.17.9"><sup id="2SA.17.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
Right now he is probably already hiding in one of the pits, or in some other place. <span id="add-2SA.17.9" class="usx-add">If his soldiers start to attack your soldiers, and</span> if they kill some of them, whoever hears about that will say ‘Many of the soldiers with Absalom have been killed!’ <a href="#2SA.17.10"><sup id="2SA.17.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
Then your other soldiers, even if they are as fearless [SIM, IDM] as lions, they will become very afraid. Do not forget that everyone in Israel knows that your father is a great/strong soldier, and that the soldiers who are with him are also very brave/courageous.</p>

    <a href="#2SA.17.11"><sup id="2SA.17.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
“So what I suggest is that you summon all the Israeli soldiers, from Dan <span id="add-2SA.17.11" class="usx-add">in the far north</span> to Beersheba <span id="add-2SA.17.11" class="usx-add">in the far south</span>.

If he escapes into some city, all our soldiers will bring ropes and pull that city down into the valley. As a result, not one stone will be left there <span id="add-2SA.17.13" class="usx-add">on top of the hill where that city was</span>!”</p>

    <a href="#2SA.17.14"><sup id="2SA.17.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
Absalom and all the other Israeli men <span id="add-2SA.17.14" class="usx-add">who were with him</span> said, “What Hushai suggests is better than what Ahithophel suggested.” The reason that happened was that Yahweh had determined that if they would accept the good advice that Ahithophel had given them, <span id="add-2SA.17.14" class="usx-add">they would have been able to defeat/kill David</span>. But <span id="add-2SA.17.14" class="usx-add">as a result of their doing what Hushai suggested</span>, Yahweh would cause a disaster to happen to Absalom.</p>

Then he said to them, “Send <span id="add-2SA.17.16" class="usx-add">a message</span> quickly to David. Tell him to not stay at the place where people walk across the river, near the desert. Instead, he and his soldiers must cross <span id="add-2SA.17.16" class="usx-add">the Jordan River</span> immediately, in order that they will not be killed/wiped out.”</p>

The man’s wife took a cloth/mat and covered the well, and scattered grain on top of it in order that no one would know <span id="add-2SA.17.19" class="usx-add">that two men were hiding inside it</span>.</p>

Then Ahimaaz said again to Joab, “Even though <span id="add-2SA.18.22" class="usx-add">that man from Ethiopia is running</span>, allow me to run behind him.” Joab replied, “My boy/son, why do you want to do that? You will not receive any reward for your news!”</p>

But Ahimaaz replied, “That does not matter, I want to go.” So Joab said, “Okay, go.” So Ahimaaz ran along <span id="add-2SA.18.23" class="usx-add">another</span> road through the Jordan Valley and arrived <span id="add-2SA.18.23" class="usx-add">where David was</span> before the man from Ethiopia arrived.</p>

David was sitting between the outer gate and the inner gate <span id="add-2SA.18.24" class="usx-add">of the city</span>.

The watchman called down and reported it to the king. The king said, “If he is alone, <span id="add-2SA.18.25" class="usx-add">that indicates/means that</span> he is bringing <span id="add-2SA.18.25" class="usx-add">good</span> news.” The man who was running continued to come closer.</p>

The watchman said, “I think the first man <span id="add-2SA.18.27" class="usx-add">must be Ahimaaz, because he</span> is running like Ahimaaz runs.” The king said, “He is a good man, and <span id="add-2SA.18.27" class="usx-add">I am sure</span> he is coming with good news.”</p>

The king covered his face <span id="add-2SA.19.4" class="usx-add">with his hands</span> and kept crying loudly, “O, my son Absalom! O, Absalom, my son! My son!”</p>

Then Joab entered the room where the king was, and said to the king, “Today you have caused your soldiers to be ashamed!

King David <span id="add-2SA.19.11" class="usx-add">found out what the people were saying.

<p id="p-2SA.23.8" class="usx-p" >The first was Esh-Baal, <span id="add-2SA.23.8" class="usx-add">whose other name was Jashobeam</span>, from the Hachmon clan (OR, the son of Hachmon). He was the leader of the three men. One time he fought against 800 enemies and killed them all with his spear.</p>

The second/next one of the three greatest warriors was Eleazar, who was the son of Dodo from the clan of Ahoh. One day he was with David when they defied/challenged the soldiers of Philistia who had gathered for the battle. The <span id="add-2SA.23.9" class="usx-add">other</span> Israeli soldiers retreated, <a href="#2SA.23.10"><sup id="2SA.23.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
but Eleazar stood there and fought the soldiers of Philistia until his arm became very tired, with the result that <span id="add-2SA.23.10" class="usx-add">his hand cramped and</span> he could not stop gripping his sword. Yahweh won a great victory on that day. And afterwards the <span id="add-2SA.23.10" class="usx-add">other</span> Israeli soldiers returned <span id="add-2SA.23.10" class="usx-add">to where Eleazar was</span>, and stripped off the <span id="add-2SA.23.10" class="usx-add">armor from the men whom he had</span> killed.</p>

    <a href="#2SA.23.11"><sup id="2SA.23.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
The third one of the greatest warriors was Shammah, the son of Agee from <span id="add-2SA.23.11" class="usx-add">the clan/town of</span> Harar. One time the Philistia soldiers gathered at Lehi <span id="add-2SA.23.11" class="usx-add">town</span>, where there was a field full of lentils/peas <span id="add-2SA.23.11" class="usx-add">that they wanted to steal</span>. The other Israeli soldiers ran away from the Philistia troops, <a href="#2SA.23.12"><sup id="2SA.23.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
but Shammah stood there in the field and did not let the Philistia soldiers <span id="add-2SA.23.12" class="usx-add">steal the crops</span>, and killed them. Yahweh won a great victory on that day.</p>

    <a href="#2SA.23.13"><sup id="2SA.23.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Altogether there were 30 special warriors among David’s soldiers. Once, when it was almost time to harvest <span id="add-2SA.23.13" class="usx-add">the crops</span>, three of those 30 men went down to Adullam Cave, where David was <span id="add-2SA.23.13" class="usx-add">staying</span>. A group of men from the Philistia army had set up their tents in Rephaim Valley <span id="add-2SA.23.13" class="usx-add">near Jerusalem</span>. <a href="#2SA.23.14"><sup id="2SA.23.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
David <span id="add-2SA.23.14" class="usx-add">and his soldiers</span> were in the cave <span id="add-2SA.23.14" class="usx-add">because it was safe there</span>, and <span id="add-2SA.23.14" class="usx-add">another</span> group of Philistia soldiers was occupying Bethlehem. <a href="#2SA.23.15"><sup id="2SA.23.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
<span id="add-2SA.23.15" class="usx-add">One day</span> David very much wanted <span id="add-2SA.23.15" class="usx-add">some water</span> to drink, and said “I wish that someone would bring me some water from the well near the gate at Bethlehem!” <a href="#2SA.23.16"><sup id="2SA.23.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
So his three greatest warriors forced their way through the camp of Philistia soldiers and drew some water from the well, and brought it to David. But he would not drink it. Instead, he poured it out <span id="add-2SA.23.16" class="usx-add">on the ground</span> as an offering to Yahweh. <a href="#2SA.23.17"><sup id="2SA.23.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
He said, “Yahweh, it would certainly not be right for me to drink this water! That would be like [RHQ] drinking the blood of these men who were willing/ready to die for me!” So he refused to drink it.</p>

Jehoiada’s son Benaiah, from Kabzeel <span id="add-2SA.23.20" class="usx-add">town</span>, also did great deeds. He killed two of the best warriors from the Moab people-group.

He also killed a huge soldier from Egypt who carried a spear. Benaiah <span id="add-2SA.23.21" class="usx-add">had only</span> his club, but he attacked the giant with it. Then he snatched the spear from the man’s hand and killed him with his own spear. <a href="#2SA.23.22"><sup id="2SA.23.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>

They have certainly not [RHQ] done anything <span id="add-2SA.24.17" class="usx-add">that is wrong</span>. So you should punish [IDM] me and my family, <span id="add-2SA.24.17" class="usx-add">not these people</span>!”</p>

That day Gad came to David and said to him, “Go up to the place where Araunah threshes grain, and build an altar to <span id="add-2SA.24.18" class="usx-add">worship</span> Yahweh there.” <a href="#2SA.24.19"><sup id="2SA.24.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
So David did what Gad told him to do, which was what Yahweh had commanded, <span id="add-2SA.24.19" class="usx-add">and he went up there</span>. <a href="#2SA.24.20"><sup id="2SA.24.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
When Araunah looked down and saw the king and his officials coming toward him, he prostrated himself on the ground in front of the king, with his face touching the ground.</p>
<p id="p-2SA.24.20" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2SA.24.21"><sup id="2SA.24.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
Araunah said, “Your Majesty, why have you come to me?” David replied, “<span id="add-2SA.24.21" class="usx-add">I have come</span> to buy this ground where you thresh grain, in order to build an altar to Yahweh <span id="add-2SA.24.21" class="usx-add">and offer sacrifices on it</span>, in order that he will stop the plague.”</p>
<p id="p-2SA.24.21" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2SA.24.22"><sup id="2SA.24.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
Araunah replied to David, “Your Majesty, offer to Yahweh whatever you wish/want. Here, take my oxen to use for the offering that will be completely burned on the altar. And here, take their yokes and the boards <span id="add-2SA.24.22" class="usx-add">that I use</span> for the threshing, <span id="add-2SA.24.22" class="usx-add">and use them</span> for the wood that you will burn. <a href="#2SA.24.23"><sup id="2SA.24.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
I, Araunah, am giving all this to you, the king.” Then he said, “I desire/hope that Yahweh our God will accept your offering.”</p>
<p id="p-2SA.24.23" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2SA.24.24"><sup id="2SA.24.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
But the king said to Araunah, “No, <span id="add-2SA.24.24" class="usx-add">I will not take these things as a gift.</span> I will pay you for it. I will not take sacrifices that have cost me nothing, and offer them to Yahweh to be completely burned on the altar.” So he paid 50 pieces of silver to Araunah for the oxen and the ground.</p>
<p id="p-2SA.24.24" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2SA.24.25"><sup id="2SA.24.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
Then David built an altar to Yahweh, and he offered <span id="add-2SA.24.25" class="usx-add">the oxen</span> to be completely burned on the altar, and he also offered sacrifices to maintain fellowship with Yahweh. Then, Yahweh answered David’s prayers, and he caused the plague in Israel to end.</p>
