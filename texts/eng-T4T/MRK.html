Having heard <span id="add-MRK.6.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">what the people were saying, King</span> Herod <span id="add-MRK.6.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Antipas</span> himself repeatedly said, “The man <span id="add-MRK.6.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">performing those miracles</span> must be John! I <span id="add-MRK.6.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">commanded my soldiers to</span> cut off his head, but he has come back to life again <span id="add-MRK.6.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to get revenge for my killing him</span>!” <a href="#MRK.6.17"><sup id="MRK.6.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
The reason <span id="add-MRK.6.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">King Herod concluded that John wanted revenge is as follows: Some time before this</span>, Herod married Herodias, while she was <span id="add-MRK.6.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">still</span> the wife of his <span id="add-MRK.6.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">younger</span> brother, Philip. <a href="#MRK.6.18"><sup id="MRK.6.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
John kept telling Herod, “<span id="add-MRK.6.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">God’s</span> law does not permit you to marry the wife of your brother <span id="add-MRK.6.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">while he is still alive</span>.” Then, because Herodias <span id="add-MRK.6.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">urged him to put John in prison</span>, Herod himself sent <span id="add-MRK.6.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">soldiers to John</span>. They seized John and put him in prison. <a href="#MRK.6.19"><sup id="MRK.6.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
But because Herodias wanted to get <span id="add-MRK.6.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">further</span> revenge on John, she wanted <span id="add-MRK.6.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">someone</span> to execute him. But she could not do that because <span id="add-MRK.6.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">while John was in prison</span>, Herod kept John safe <span id="add-MRK.6.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">from her</span>. <a href="#MRK.6.20"><sup id="MRK.6.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
Herod did this because he respected/feared John, because he knew that he was a righteous and holy man. The king did not know what he should do, but he liked to listen to him. <a href="#MRK.6.21"><sup id="MRK.6.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
But <span id="add-MRK.6.21" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Herodias was able to have someone execute John when they honored/celebrated</span> the day when Herod was born. On that day, he invited the <span id="add-MRK.6.21" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">most important</span> government officials, the <span id="add-MRK.6.21" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">most important</span> army leaders, and the most important men in Galilee <span id="add-MRK.6.21" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">district</span> in order that they might eat <span id="add-MRK.6.21" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and celebrate with him</span>. <a href="#MRK.6.22"><sup id="MRK.6.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
<span id="add-MRK.6.22" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">While they were eating</span>, Herodias’ daughter came into the room and danced, and that pleased <span id="add-MRK.6.22" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">King</span> Herod and his guests. So the king said to her, “Ask me for whatever you desire and I will give it to you!” <a href="#MRK.6.23"><sup id="MRK.6.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
He said to her, “Whatever you ask, I will give it to you! I will give you up to half of what I own and rule, if you ask for it. May God punish me <span id="add-MRK.6.23" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">if I do not do what I have promised</span>!” <a href="#MRK.6.24"><sup id="MRK.6.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
The girl immediately left the room and went to her mother. She <span id="add-MRK.6.24" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">told her what the king had said, and</span> asked her, “What shall I ask for?” Her mother replied, “<span id="add-MRK.6.24" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Ask the king to give you</span> the head of John the Baptizer!” <a href="#MRK.6.25"><sup id="MRK.6.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
The girl quickly entered the room again. She went to the king and she requested, “I want you to command someone to <span id="add-MRK.6.25" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">cut off</span> the head of John the Baptizer <span id="add-MRK.6.25" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and</span> give it to me at once on a platter, <span id="add-MRK.6.25" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">so that my mother can know he is dead</span>!” <a href="#MRK.6.26"><sup id="MRK.6.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
The king became very distressed <span id="add-MRK.6.26" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">when he heard what she asked for</span>, because he knew John was a very righteous man (OR, because he now knew that he should not have made that promise to her). But he could not refuse <span id="add-MRK.6.26" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">what she requested because</span> he had promised <span id="add-MRK.6.26" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that he would give her anything she asked for</span>, and because his guests <span id="add-MRK.6.26" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">had heard him promise that</span>. <a href="#MRK.6.27"><sup id="MRK.6.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
So the king at once ordered the man who executes prisoners to go and <span id="add-MRK.6.27" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">cut off</span> John’s head and bring it <span id="add-MRK.6.27" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to the girl</span>. That man went to the prison and cut off John’s head. <a href="#MRK.6.28"><sup id="MRK.6.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
He <span id="add-MRK.6.28" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">put it on</span> a platter, brought it back, and gave it to the girl. The girl took it to her mother. <a href="#MRK.6.29"><sup id="MRK.6.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>
After John’s disciples heard <span id="add-MRK.6.29" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">what happened</span>, they went <span id="add-MRK.6.29" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to the prison</span> and took John’s body and then they buried <span id="add-MRK.6.29" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">it in a burial cave</span>.</p>

He made a stone tank <span id="add-MRK.12.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to collect the juice that</span> they would press <span id="add-MRK.12.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">out of the grapes</span>. He also built a tower <span id="add-MRK.12.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">for someone to sit in to guard his vineyard</span>. Then he leased the vineyard to some men to care for it and <span id="add-MRK.12.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to</span> give him some of the <span id="add-MRK.12.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">grapes</span> in return.

When the time came to harvest the <span id="add-MRK.12.2" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">grapes</span>, he sent a servant to the men <span id="add-MRK.12.2" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">who were taking care of the vineyard</span> in order to receive from them his share of the grapes that the vineyard had produced. <a href="#MRK.12.3"><sup id="MRK.12.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
But <span id="add-MRK.12.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">after the servant arrived</span>, they grabbed him and beat him, and they did not give him any fruit. Then they sent him away. <a href="#MRK.12.4"><sup id="MRK.12.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>

So, finally he sent his son to them because he thought that they would respect him <span id="add-MRK.12.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and give him some of the grapes</span>. <a href="#MRK.12.7"><sup id="MRK.12.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>

The chief priests and all the rest of the Jewish council <span id="add-MRK.14.55" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">had already</span> tried to find people who would tell lies about Jesus <span id="add-MRK.14.55" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in order that they could convince the Roman authorities</span> to execute him.

But when she told them that Jesus was alive again and that she had seen him, they refused to believe it. <a href="#MRK.16.12"><sup id="MRK.16.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
Later <span id="add-MRK.16.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that day</span>, Jesus appeared to two of <span id="add-MRK.16.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">his disciples</span> while they were walking <span id="add-MRK.16.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">from Jerusalem to their homes in</span> the <span id="add-MRK.16.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">surrounding</span> area. <span id="add-MRK.16.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">But they did not recognize him quickly because</span> he looked very different. <a href="#MRK.16.13"><sup id="MRK.16.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
<span id="add-MRK.16.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">After they recognized him</span>, those two went back <span id="add-MRK.16.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to Jerusalem. They told his other followers what had happened</span>, but they did not believe it. <a href="#MRK.16.14"><sup id="MRK.16.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
Later he appeared to the eleven <span id="add-MRK.16.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">apostles</span> while they were eating. He rebuked them because they had stubbornly refused to believe <span id="add-MRK.16.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the reports of</span> those who saw him after he had become alive again.</p>
<p id="s1-MRK.16.14" class="usx-s1" >Miracles began to happen after Jesus instructed his disciples to preach the gospel everywhere and he told them that miracles would accompany their ministry.</p>

    <span id="add-MRK.16.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Later</span> he said to them, “Go into the whole world and preach the good message to everyone! <a href="#MRK.16.16"><sup id="MRK.16.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
Everyone who believes <span id="add-MRK.16.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">your message</span> and who is baptized will be saved {<span id="add-MRK.16.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">God</span> will save}. But everyone who does not believe it will be condemned {<span id="add-MRK.16.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">God</span> will condemn}. <a href="#MRK.16.17"><sup id="MRK.16.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
Those who believe <span id="add-MRK.16.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">my good message</span> will perform miracles.

If they pick up snakes <span id="add-MRK.16.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">accidentally</span> or if they drink any poisonous <span id="add-MRK.16.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">liquid accidentally</span>, they will not be hurt. <span id="add-MRK.16.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Whenever</span> they put their hands on sick <span id="add-MRK.16.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">people in order that God will heal them</span>, those sick people will become well.”</p>

After the Lord Jesus had said this to <span id="add-MRK.16.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the disciples, he was taken</span> {<span id="add-MRK.16.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">God</span> took him} up into heaven. Then he sat down on his throne beside God <span id="add-MRK.16.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to rule with him</span>. <a href="#MRK.16.20"><sup id="MRK.16.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
<span id="add-MRK.16.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">As for the disciples</span>, they went out <span id="add-MRK.16.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">from Jerusalem, and then they preached everywhere. Wherever they went</span>, the Lord enabled them to perform miracles. <span id="add-MRK.16.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">By doing that</span>, he showed people that God’s message is true.</p>
