<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    I am Zephaniah, the son of Cushi, the grandson of Gedaliah, and the great-grandson of Amariah, whose father was King Hezekiah. Yahweh gave this message to me during the time when King Amon’s son Josiah was the King of Judah.</p><p>The future destruction</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Yahweh says,</p><p>“I will ◄sweep away/destroy► everything [HYP] that is on the earth.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>I will sweep away people and animals.</p><p>I will sweep away birds and fish.</p><p>I will get rid of wicked people;</p><p>there will be no more wicked [HYP] people on the earth.”</p><p>Yahweh will punish Judah</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>“These are some of the things that I will do:</p><p>I will punish the people who live in Jerusalem and other places in Judah.</p><p>I will destroy everything that has been used in the worship of Baal.</p><p>I will cause people to no longer remember the names of the pagan priests</p><p>or the other priests who have turned away from me.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    I will get rid of those who go up on the roofs of their houses and worship the sun and moon and stars,</p><p>those who claim that they worship me but also worship their god Molech.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>I will get rid of all those who previously worshiped me but no longer do,</p><p>those who no longer seek my help or ask me to tell them what they should do.”</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Be silent in front of Yahweh the Lord,</p><p>because it will soon be the time/day when Yahweh will judge and punish people.</p><p>Yahweh has prepared to get rid of the people of Judah;</p><p>they will be like [MET] animals that are slaughtered for sacrifices,</p><p>and he has chosen their enemies to be the ones who will get rid of them.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Yahweh says, “On that day when I will get rid of the people of Judah,</p><p>
    I will punish their officials and the king’s sons,</p><p>and I will punish all those who worship foreign gods [MTY].</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>I will punish those who show that they revere their god Dagan by avoiding stepping on the threshold of his temple,</p><p>and those who do violent things and tell lies in the temples of their gods.”</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Yahweh also says,</p><p>“On that day, people will cry out at the Fish Gate of Jerusalem.</p><p>People will wail in the newer part of the city,</p><p>and people will hear a loud crash of buildings collapsing in the hills.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    So, all you people who live in the market area of Jerusalem should wail,</p><p>because all those who sell goods and weigh out silver will be slaughtered.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    It will be as though I will light lanterns to search in dark places in Jerusalem</p><p>for those who have become very satisfied with their behavior and complacent about their sins.</p><p>They think that I, Yahweh, will do nothing to them,</p><p>neither good things nor bad things.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    But I say that their valuable possessions will be plundered/stolen by their enemies,</p><p>and their houses will be destroyed.</p><p>They will build new homes,</p><p>but they will not live in them;</p><p>they will plant vineyards,</p><p>but they will never drink any wine made from grapes that grow there.”</p><p>The day of punishment</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>It will soon be the day/time when Yahweh will punish people.</p><p>It will be here quickly.</p><p>It will be a time when people cry bitterly,</p><p>a time when even brave soldiers will cry loudly.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>It will be a time when God shows that he is very angry,</p><p>a time when people experience much distress/suffering and trouble.</p><p>
    It will be a time when many things are ruined and destroyed [DOU].</p><p>It will be a time when it is very gloomy and dark [DOU],</p><p>when the clouds are very black.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>It will be a time when soldiers will blow trumpets to call other soldiers to battle.</p><p>
    Your enemies will tear down the walls around your cities</p><p>and the high towers at the corners of those walls.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Because you sinned against Yahweh,</p><p>he will cause you to experience great distress;</p><p>you will walk around groping like [SIM] blind people do.</p><p>Your blood will flow from your bodies like [SIM] water,</p><p>and your corpses will lie on the ground and rot [SIM].</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>At the time that Yahweh shows that he is very angry with you,</p><p>you will not be able to save yourselves</p><p>by giving silver or gold to your enemies.</p><p>Because Yahweh ◄is very jealous/does not want people to worship any other god►,</p><p>he will send a fire to burn up the entire world,</p><p>and he will suddenly get rid of all the wicked people who live on the earth.</p><a href="#ZEPHANIAH-c-2"><h3 id="ZEPHANIAH-c-2">2</h3></a>
<p>A call to repentance</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>You people of Judah who ought to be ashamed,</p><p>gather together [DOU].</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Yahweh is extremely angry with you,</p><p>
    so gather together now,</p><p>before it is time for him to punish [MTY] you</p><p>and blow you away like [SIM] the wind blows away chaff.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>All you people in Judah who are humble,</p><p>worship Yahweh, and obey what he has commanded.</p><p>Try to do what is right</p><p>and to be humble.</p><p>
    If you do that, perhaps Yahweh will protect/spare you</p><p>on the day when he punishes [MTY] people.</p><p>Yahweh will punish Philistia</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    When Yahweh punishes Philistia,</p><p>Gaza and Ashkelon cities will be deserted/abandoned.</p><p>Ashdod city will be attacked and the people expelled at noon when people are resting;</p><p>the people of Ekron city will also be driven out.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>And terrible things will happen to you people of Philistia who live near the sea,</p><p>because Yahweh has decided [MTY] that he will punish [MTY] you, also.</p><p>He will get rid of all of you;</p><p>not one person will ◄survive/remain alive►.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>The land of Philistia near the sea will become a pasture,</p><p>a place for shepherds and their sheep pens.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>The people of Judah who ◄survive/are still alive► will possess that land.</p><p>At night they will sleep in the deserted houses in Ashkelon.</p><p>Yahweh will take care of them;</p><p>he will enable them to prosper again.</p><p>Yahweh will punish Moab and Ammon</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>The Commander of the armies of angels, the God to whom we Israeli people belong, says this:</p><p>“I have heard the people of Moab and Ammon</p><p>when they insulted [DOU] my people,</p><p>and when they said that they would conquer my people’s country.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>So now, as surely as I live, I will destroy Moab and Ammon</p><p>like [SIM] I destroyed Gomorrah city.</p><p>Their land will be a place were there are nettles and salt pits;</p><p>it will be ruined forever.</p><p>My Israeli people who survive will take away all their valuable possessions</p><p>and also occupy their land.”</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>The people of Moab and Ammon will get what they deserve for being proud,</p><p>because they made fun of the people who belong to the Commander of the armies of angels.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Yahweh will cause them to be terrified</p><p>
    when he destroys all the gods of their countries.</p><p>Then even the people who live on islands throughout the world will worship Yahweh,</p><p>each in their own countries.</p><p>Yahweh will punish Ethiopia</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    Yahweh says that he will also slaughter the people of Ethiopia.</p><p>Yahweh will punish Assyria</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Yahweh will punish [IDM] and destroy Assyria,</p><p>
    that land northeast of us.</p><p>He will cause its capital Nineveh to become ruined and deserted,</p><p>a place that will be as dry as the desert.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    Flocks of sheep and herds of cattle and many kinds of wild animals will lie down there.</p><p>Owls and crows will sit on the columns/pillars of the destroyed buildings,</p><p>and they will ◄hoot/cry out► through the windows.</p><p>There will be rubble in the doorways,</p><p>and the valuable cedar boards will be taken from the ruined houses.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    The people of Nineveh were previously happy and proud,</p><p>thinking that they were very safe.</p><p>They were always saying,</p><p>“Our city is the greatest city;</p><p>there is no city as great as ours!”</p><p>But now it will become a ruins,</p><p>a place where wild animals make their dens.</p><p>And everyone who passes by there will hiss and scorn/ridicule that city,</p><p>and shake their fists to show that they detest that city very much.</p><a href="#ZEPHANIAH-c-3"><h3 id="ZEPHANIAH-c-3">3</h3></a>
<p>Yahweh will some day restore Jerusalem, whose people have rebelled against him</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Terrible things will also happen to Jerusalem,</p><p>that city whose people have rebelled against Yahweh</p><p>and who have become unacceptable to him because of the sins that they have committed.</p><p>
    They act violently toward others and they ◄oppress/treat cruelly► other people.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    The people there do not pay attention to people who tell them the wrong things that they are doing</p><p>and try to ◄correct them/cause them to quit doing those things►.</p><p>
    The people in Jerusalem do not trust in Yahweh</p><p>or draw near to ask help from their God.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Their leaders are like [MET] roaring lions;</p><p>they are like [MET] wolves that attack other animals during the evening,</p><p>
    and eat everything that they kill,</p><p>with the result that the next morning there is nothing left of those animals to eat.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>The prophets in Jerusalem are proud,</p><p>
    and they give messages that are not to be trusted.</p><p>Their priests cause the temple to be unholy</p><p>by doing things that are opposed to the laws of Moses.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>But Yahweh is also in the city;</p><p>and he never does what is wrong.</p><p>He treats people justly/fairly;</p><p>he does that every day,</p><p>but wicked people are never ashamed about their doing what is wrong.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    Yahweh says this:</p><p>“I have destroyed many nations;</p><p>I have destroyed their strong/high city walls and towers.</p><p>
    Now I have caused the streets in those cities to be completely deserted [DOU];</p><p>the cities are ruined.</p><p>There are no people still alive in the cities;</p><p>they are all dead [LIT].</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    So I thought to myself,</p><p>‘Because of what I have done to those other nations,</p><p>surely the people of Jerusalem will revere me now,</p><p>and they will accept ◄my correcting them/my telling them to quit doing what is wrong►.</p><p>
    If they do that, I will not destroy their houses;</p><p>I will not punish them like I said that I would do.’</p><p>But in spite of knowing how I punished those other nations,</p><p>they were still eager to get up early each morning</p><p>and continue to do evil things.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Therefore I, Yahweh, say,</p><p>‘Wait for the day in which I will testify in court about your evil things.’</p><p>I have decided to gather the people of the kingdoms of the earth [DOU]</p><p>and cause them to know that I am very angry with them.</p><p>All over the earth I will punish and destroy people;</p><p>my being angry with them because I ◄am jealous/want people to worship no other god► is like [MET] a ◄raging/very hot► fire.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>When that happens, I will cause all people [MTY] to be changed</p><p>and enable them to speak only what is ◄pure/pleasing to me►,</p><p>in order that everyone can worship me [MTY]</p><p>and unitedly/together serve me [MTY].</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    Then my people who were forced to go to other countries, those who live along the upper part of the Nile River in Ethiopia</p><p>will come to me and bring offerings to me.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>At that time, you people in Jerusalem will no longer be ashamed about what has happened to you,</p><p>because you no longer will be rebelling against me.</p><p>I will get rid of all the people among you who are very proud [DOU].</p><p>No one on Zion, my holy hill, will strut around proudly.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Those who are still alive in Israel will be poor and humble;</p><p>they will be people who trust in me [MTY].</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Those people who are still alive there in Israel will not do things that are wrong;</p><p>they will not tell lies or deceive [MTY] people.</p><p>They will eat and sleep safely,</p><p>
    because no one will cause them to be afraid.”</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>You people who live in Jerusalem [DOU] and other places in Israel,</p><p>sing and shout loudly!</p><p>Be glad, and rejoice [DOU] greatly,</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    because Yahweh will stop punishing [MTY] you,</p><p>and he will send away from you the armies of your enemies!</p><p>And Yahweh himself, the king of us Israeli people, will live among us,</p><p>and never again will we be afraid that others will harm us.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>At that time, other people will say to us people of Jerusalem,</p><p>“You people of [APO] Jerusalem, do not be afraid;</p><p>do not become afraid or discouraged,</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    because Yahweh your God is living among you.</p><p>He is mighty, and he will rescue/save you.</p><p>He will be very happy with you;</p><p>because he loves you, he will cause you to not be afraid;</p><p>he will sing loudly to rejoice over you.”</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    Yahweh says, “You people were sad and ashamed</p><p>because you were unable to attend your religious festivals;</p><p>but I will cause you to no longer be disgraced.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Truly, I will severely punish all those who ◄oppressed you/caused you to suffer►.</p><p>I will rescue those who are helpless</p><p>and those who were forced to go to other countries.</p><p>I will enable them to be praised and honored in every country to which they were ◄exiled/forced to go►,</p><p>places where they were disgraced.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>At that time, I will gather you together</p><p>and bring you back home to Israel.</p><p>I will cause you to ◄have a good reputation/be honored► and be greatly praised</p><p>among all the nations of the earth.</p><p>You [MTY] will see me causing you to prosper again.</p><p>
    That will surely happen because I, Yahweh, have said it.”</p><a href="#ZEPHANIAH-h">^</a> <a href="#ZEPHANIAH-c-1">[1]</a> <a href="#ZEPHANIAH-c-2">[2]</a> <a href="#ZEPHANIAH-c-3">[3]</a>
