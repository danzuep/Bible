    <a href="#DEU.1.1"><sup id="DEU.1.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
In this book is written what Moses/I said to the Israeli people. He/I told them these things when they/we were in the desert, on the east side of the Jordan <span id="add-DEU.1.1" class="usx-add">River</span>. They/We had set up our tents near <span id="add-DEU.1.1" class="usx-add">a place named</span> Suph, between Paran <span id="add-DEU.1.1" class="usx-add">town on the one side of the river</span> and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab <span id="add-DEU.1.1" class="usx-add">towns on the other side of the river</span>. <a href="#DEU.1.2"><sup id="DEU.1.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
To walk from Sinai <span id="add-DEU.1.2" class="usx-add">Mountain</span> to the Kadesh-Barnea <span id="add-DEU.1.2" class="usx-add">oasis</span>, people usually travel for only eleven days, going by way of the hilly area named Edom.</p>
<p id="p-DEU.1.2" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DEU.1.3"><sup id="DEU.1.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
Forty years after ◄the Israelis/we► left Egypt, in the middle of January, Moses/I told the Israeli people everything that Yahweh had commanded him/me to tell them. <a href="#DEU.1.4"><sup id="DEU.1.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
This was after they/we had defeated Sihon, the king of the Amor people-group, who lived in Heshbon <span id="add-DEU.1.4" class="usx-add">city</span>, and Og, the king of the Bashan <span id="add-DEU.1.4" class="usx-add">region</span> who lived in Ashtaroth and Edrei <span id="add-DEU.1.4" class="usx-add">towns</span>.</p>
<p id="p-DEU.1.4" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DEU.1.5"><sup id="DEU.1.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
Moses/I told them these things while the people were in the Moab region, on the east side of the Jordan <span id="add-DEU.1.5" class="usx-add">River</span>. He/I ◄explained to them/enabled them to understand► God’s laws. This is what he/I said to them:</p>
<p id="p-DEU.1.5" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DEU.1.6"><sup id="DEU.1.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
“Yahweh our God said to us when we were at Sinai <span id="add-DEU.1.6" class="usx-add">Mountain</span>, ‘You have stayed for a very long time at <span id="add-DEU.1.6" class="usx-add">the bottom of</span> this mountain. <a href="#DEU.1.7"><sup id="DEU.1.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
So now continue traveling. Go to the hilly area where the Amor people-group lives and to the nearby areas—to the Jordan <span id="add-DEU.1.7" class="usx-add">River</span> Valley, to the hilly region, to the western ◄foothills/hills at the bottom of the mountains►, to the desert area to the south, to the <span id="add-DEU.1.7" class="usx-add">Mediterranean</span> Seacoast, to all of Canaan land, to the Lebanon <span id="add-DEU.1.7" class="usx-add">Mountains</span>, and <span id="add-DEU.1.7" class="usx-add">northeast</span> to the great Euphrates River. <a href="#DEU.1.8"><sup id="DEU.1.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
Note that I will give that land to you. I, Yahweh, promised to your ancestors Abraham and Isaac and Jacob that I would give it to them and to their descendants. So now go and occupy it.’”</p>
<p id="s1-DEU.1.8" class="usx-s1" >Moses reminded them that he had appointed leaders</p>
<p id="p-DEU.1.8" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DEU.1.9"><sup id="DEU.1.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
Moses/I also said to the people, “When <span id="add-DEU.1.9" class="usx-add">we were still at Sinai Mountain</span>, I told your ancestors ‘It is a very big burden/responsibility for me to govern all of you. So I cannot do it by myself. <a href="#DEU.1.10"><sup id="DEU.1.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
Yahweh our God has caused us Israelis to now become as numerous as the stars in the sky. <a href="#DEU.1.11"><sup id="DEU.1.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
And I hope/desire that Yahweh, the God whom our ancestors <span id="add-DEU.1.11" class="usx-add">worshiped</span>, will cause us to become 1,000 times as numerous as we are now and that he will bless us just like he promised to do. <a href="#DEU.1.12"><sup id="DEU.1.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
But I certainly cannot [RHQ] ◄solve/deal with► all of your complaints/problems. <a href="#DEU.1.13"><sup id="DEU.1.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
So choose some men from your tribes who are wise and who have good sense and who are respected. Then I will appoint them to be your leaders.’</p>
<p id="p-DEU.1.13" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DEU.1.14"><sup id="DEU.1.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
Your ancestors replied, ‘What you have suggested is good for us to do.’</p>
<p id="p-DEU.1.14" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DEU.1.15"><sup id="DEU.1.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
So I took the wise and respected men <span id="add-DEU.1.15" class="usx-add">that your ancestors chose</span> from your tribes, and I appointed them to be your leaders. I appointed some to ◄rule/have authority► over 1,000 people, some to have authority over 100 people, some to have authority over 50 people, and some to have authority over ten people. I also appointed other officers from throughout your tribes. <a href="#DEU.1.16"><sup id="DEU.1.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
I instructed/told your leaders, ‘Listen to the disputes that occur among your people. Judge each dispute, including disputes between close relatives and quarrels between your people and people from other countries who live among you. <a href="#DEU.1.17"><sup id="DEU.1.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
You must ◄be impartial/not favor one person more than another►; you must treat poor people and important people equally. You must not worry about what anyone will think <span id="add-DEU.1.17" class="usx-add">about how you decide matters</span>, because you will decide matters as God <span id="add-DEU.1.17" class="usx-add">wants you to</span>. If any quarrel/dispute is very difficult and you are unable to decide it, bring it to me, and I will decide.’ <a href="#DEU.1.18"><sup id="DEU.1.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
At that time I also told you other things that you should do.”</p>
<p id="s1-DEU.1.18" class="usx-s1" >Moses reminded them about sending the spies</p>
<p id="p-DEU.1.18" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DEU.1.19"><sup id="DEU.1.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
“Then, just like Yahweh our God commanded us, we left Sinai <span id="add-DEU.1.19" class="usx-add">Mountain</span> and went through that huge desert that was very ◄dangerous/difficult to travel through►, on the road to the hilly area where the Amor people-group live. We arrived at Kadesh-Barnea. <a href="#DEU.1.20"><sup id="DEU.1.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
I said to your ancestors, ‘We have now come to the hilly area where the Amor people-group live. This is part of the area that Yahweh our God, the one whom our ancestors <span id="add-DEU.1.20" class="usx-add">worshiped</span>, is giving to us. <a href="#DEU.1.21"><sup id="DEU.1.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
Note that Yahweh our God is giving this land to us. So go and occupy it as he commanded. Do not be ◄at all/even a little bit► afraid.’</p>
<p id="p-DEU.1.21" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DEU.1.22"><sup id="DEU.1.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
But all of your ancestors came to me and said, ‘Before we go, we should <span id="add-DEU.1.22" class="usx-add">first</span> send some men there to explore the land, in order that they can return and tell us which will be the best road to go there and what kind of towns are there.’</p>
<p id="p-DEU.1.22" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DEU.1.23"><sup id="DEU.1.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
I thought that it would be good to do that, so I chose twelve men, one man from each tribe. <a href="#DEU.1.24"><sup id="DEU.1.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
They went up into the hilly area as far as Eshcol Valley, and they explored all that area. <a href="#DEU.1.25"><sup id="DEU.1.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
They picked some of the fruit that they found there and brought it to us. They reported that the land that Yahweh our God was giving to us is very good/fertile.”</p>
<p id="s1-DEU.1.25" class="usx-s1" >Moses reminded them how God punished them when they refused to go</p>
<p id="p-DEU.1.25" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DEU.1.26"><sup id="DEU.1.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
“But your ancestors refused to go <span id="add-DEU.1.26" class="usx-add">and conquer that land</span>. They rebelled against what Yahweh our God had commanded them to do, and they would not go into that land. <a href="#DEU.1.27"><sup id="DEU.1.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
Your ancestors <span id="add-DEU.1.27" class="usx-add">stayed</span> in their tents and complained saying ‘Yahweh hates us. So he has brought us here from Egypt just to allow the Amor people-group to destroy us. <a href="#DEU.1.28"><sup id="DEU.1.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
◄Why should we go there?/We do not want to go there.► [RHQ] The men whom we sent there have caused us to become very discouraged/afraid. They have told us that the people there are much stronger and taller than we are and that there are extremely high [HYP] walls around their towns. Also they reported that they saw <span id="add-DEU.1.28" class="usx-add">giants there that are</span> descendants of Anak.’</p>
<p id="p-DEU.1.28" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DEU.1.29"><sup id="DEU.1.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>
Then I said to your ancestors, ‘Do not be afraid ◄at all/even a little bit► [DOU] of those people! <a href="#DEU.1.30"><sup id="DEU.1.30" class="usx-v">30</sup></a>
Yahweh our God will go ahead of you, and he will fight for you, just like you saw him do for you in Egypt <a href="#DEU.1.31"><sup id="DEU.1.31" class="usx-v">31</sup></a>
and in the desert. You saw how he brought you safely here, like a man would carry his son. [SIM]’</p>
<p id="p-DEU.1.31" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DEU.1.32-33"><sup id="DEU.1.32-33" class="usx-v">32-33</sup></a>

    <span id="add-DEU.1.32-33" class="usx-add">I reminded them that</span> he always went ahead of them while they traveled <span id="add-DEU.1.32-33" class="usx-add">in the desert</span>. He directed them by <span id="add-DEU.1.32-33" class="usx-add">a pillar of</span> fire during the night and a <span id="add-DEU.1.32-33" class="usx-add">pillar of</span> cloud during the day. He showed them places to set up their tents. But in spite of what I said, your ancestors would not trust Yahweh our God.</p>
<p id="p-DEU.1.32-33" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DEU.1.34"><sup id="DEU.1.34" class="usx-v">34</sup></a>
Yahweh heard what they said, and he became angry. He solemnly declared, <a href="#DEU.1.35-36"><sup id="DEU.1.35-36" class="usx-v">35-36</sup></a>
‘Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, will enter the land. He has obeyed me completely. So I will give to him and to his descendants <span id="add-DEU.1.35-36" class="usx-add">some of</span> the land that he explored. He is the only one of all you people who will enter that land. None of these evil people will ever see that good land which I solemnly promised to give to your ancestors.’</p>
<p id="p-DEU.1.35-36" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DEU.1.37"><sup id="DEU.1.37" class="usx-v">37</sup></a>
But because of <span id="add-DEU.1.37" class="usx-add">what</span> your ancestors <span id="add-DEU.1.37" class="usx-add">did</span>, Yahweh was also angry with me. He said to me, ‘You also will not enter that land. <a href="#DEU.1.38"><sup id="DEU.1.38" class="usx-v">38</sup></a>
Joshua, the son of Nun, who is your helper, will enter it. Encourage him, because he is the one who will enable you Israeli people to occupy that land.’</p>
<p id="p-DEU.1.38" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DEU.1.39"><sup id="DEU.1.39" class="usx-v">39</sup></a>
Then Yahweh said to all of us, ‘You said that your children would be captured by your enemies. Because they are very young, they do not yet know what is good and what is evil. But they are the ones to whom I will give that land, and they will enter it and occupy it. <a href="#DEU.1.40"><sup id="DEU.1.40" class="usx-v">40</sup></a>
But as for you, turn around and go back into the desert, toward the ◄Red Sea/Gulf of Aqaba►.’</p>
<p id="p-DEU.1.40" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DEU.1.41"><sup id="DEU.1.41" class="usx-v">41</sup></a>
Then your ancestors replied, ‘We have sinned; we have disobeyed Yahweh. So we will go and attack <span id="add-DEU.1.41" class="usx-add">the people who live in</span> that land, just like Yahweh our God commanded us to do.’ And each of their men put on his weapons, and they thought that it would be easy to invade the hilly region.</p>
<p id="p-DEU.1.41" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DEU.1.42"><sup id="DEU.1.42" class="usx-v">42</sup></a>
But Yahweh said to me, ‘Tell them, “Do not go up there and attack those people, because I will not go with you. If you go, your enemies will defeat you.”’</p>
<p id="p-DEU.1.42" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DEU.1.43"><sup id="DEU.1.43" class="usx-v">43</sup></a>
So I told that to your ancestors, but they would not heed what I said. They <span id="add-DEU.1.43" class="usx-add">again</span> rebelled against what Yahweh commanded them to do. Their soldiers proudly/arrogantly marched up into that hilly region. <a href="#DEU.1.44"><sup id="DEU.1.44" class="usx-v">44</sup></a>
Then the men of the Amor people-group who lived in that region came out <span id="add-DEU.1.44" class="usx-add">of their towns</span> and attacked those soldiers. They pursued your ancestors’ soldiers like <span id="add-DEU.1.44" class="usx-add">a swarm of</span> bees pursues people, and they pursued them <span id="add-DEU.1.44" class="usx-add">south</span> from the Edom area and defeated them at Hormah <span id="add-DEU.1.44" class="usx-add">city</span>. <a href="#DEU.1.45"><sup id="DEU.1.45" class="usx-v">45</sup></a>
So your ancestors went back <span id="add-DEU.1.45" class="usx-add">to Kadesh-Barnea</span> and cried out to request Yahweh <span id="add-DEU.1.45" class="usx-add">to help them</span>, but he did not heed them. He did not pay any attention to them [DOU]. <a href="#DEU.1.46"><sup id="DEU.1.46" class="usx-v">46</sup></a>
So we stayed there at Kadesh-Barnea for a long time.”</p>
<a href="#DEU.2"><h3 id="DEU.2" class="usx-c">2</h3></a>
<p id="s1-DEU.2" class="usx-s1" >Moses reminded them of their wandering in the desert</p>

    <a href="#DEU.2.1"><sup id="DEU.2.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
“Then we turned around and went through the desert toward the ◄Red Sea/Gulf of Aqaba►, as Yahweh told us to do, and we wandered in the Edom area for many years.</p>
<p id="p-DEU.2.1" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DEU.2.2"><sup id="DEU.2.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>

but do not start to fight against them, because I am not going to give you even a tiny bit [HYP] of their land. I have given that land to the descendants of Esau. <a href="#DEU.2.6"><sup id="DEU.2.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
<span id="add-DEU.2.6" class="usx-add">When you travel near their land</span>, buy food and water from them.’</p>
<p id="p-DEU.2.6" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DEU.2.7"><sup id="DEU.2.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Do not forget that Yahweh our God has blessed you in everything that you [SYN] have done.

Then Moses climbed up from the plains in the Moab <span id="add-DEU.34.1" class="usx-add">region</span> to the top of Pisgah Peak on Nebo Mountain, across <span id="add-DEU.34.1" class="usx-add">the Jordan River</span> from Jericho. There Yahweh showed him all the land <span id="add-DEU.34.1" class="usx-add">that the Israelis would occupy</span>. He showed him the Gilead <span id="add-DEU.34.1" class="usx-add">region</span> as far north as Dan <span id="add-DEU.34.1" class="usx-add">city</span>; <a href="#DEU.34.2"><sup id="DEU.34.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
all <span id="add-DEU.34.2" class="usx-add">the land that the tribe of</span> Naphtali would occupy; all the land <span id="add-DEU.34.2" class="usx-add">that the tribes</span> of Ephraim and Manasseh <span id="add-DEU.34.2" class="usx-add">had occupied</span>; all the land <span id="add-DEU.34.2" class="usx-add">that the tribe of</span> Judah would occupy as far west as the Mediterranean sea; <a href="#DEU.34.3"><sup id="DEU.34.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
the desert <span id="add-DEU.34.3" class="usx-add">area in the south part of Judah</span>; and the <span id="add-DEU.34.3" class="usx-add">Jordan</span> Valley that extends from Jericho <span id="add-DEU.34.3" class="usx-add">in the north</span> to Zoar <span id="add-DEU.34.3" class="usx-add">city in the south</span>. <a href="#DEU.34.4"><sup id="DEU.34.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
Then Yahweh said to him, “You have now seen this land that I solemnly promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying ‘I will give it to your descendants.’ I have allowed you to see it <span id="add-DEU.34.4" class="usx-add">from a distance</span>, but you will not go there.”</p>

    <a href="#DEU.34.5"><sup id="DEU.34.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
So Moses, who <span id="add-DEU.34.5" class="usx-add">always</span> served Yahweh <span id="add-DEU.34.5" class="usx-add">faithfully</span>, died there <span id="add-DEU.34.5" class="usx-add">on that mountain</span> in the Moab <span id="add-DEU.34.5" class="usx-add">region</span>, which is what Yahweh said would happen. <a href="#DEU.34.6"><sup id="DEU.34.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
Yahweh buried Moses’ body in a valley in the Moab <span id="add-DEU.34.6" class="usx-add">region</span>, opposite/near Beth-Peor <span id="add-DEU.34.6" class="usx-add">town</span>, but no one to this day knows where Yahweh buried him. <a href="#DEU.34.7"><sup id="DEU.34.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Moses was 120 years old when he died, but he was still very strong, and he could still see [MTY] very well. <a href="#DEU.34.8"><sup id="DEU.34.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
The Israeli people mourned for him in the plains of the Moab <span id="add-DEU.34.8" class="usx-add">region</span> for 30 days.</p>

    <a href="#DEU.34.9"><sup id="DEU.34.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
God caused Joshua to be very wise, because Moses had put his hands on Joshua <span id="add-DEU.34.9" class="usx-add">to appoint him to be their new leader</span>. The Israeli people obeyed Joshua, and they obeyed all the commands that Yahweh had given to Moses to tell to the Israeli people.</p>

Since the time that Moses <span id="add-DEU.34.10" class="usx-add">lived</span>, there has never been a prophet in Israel like him. Yahweh spoke to him face-to-face/directly. <a href="#DEU.34.11"><sup id="DEU.34.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
No other prophet has performed all the kinds of [DOU] miracles that Yahweh sent Moses to perform in front of the king of Egypt, his officials, and all [HYP] the people of Egypt. <a href="#DEU.34.12"><sup id="DEU.34.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
No other prophet has been able to do all the great and terrifying things that Moses did while all the Israelis watched.</p>
