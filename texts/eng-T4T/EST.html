    <a href="#EST.1.1"><sup id="EST.1.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
King Xerxes ruled <span id="add-EST.1.1" class="usx-add">a very big empire which had</span> 127 provinces. It extended from India <span id="add-EST.1.1" class="usx-add">in the east</span> to Ethiopia <span id="add-EST.1.1" class="usx-add">in the west</span>. <a href="#EST.1.2"><sup id="EST.1.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
He ruled the empire <span id="add-EST.1.2" class="usx-add">while he lived</span> in the capital city, Susa. <a href="#EST.1.3"><sup id="EST.1.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
During the third year that he ruled his empire, he invited all his administrators and <span id="add-EST.1.3" class="usx-add">other</span> officials to a big banquet/feast. He invited all the commanders of the armies of Persia and Media to come to the banquet. He also invited the governors and other leaders of the provinces. <a href="#EST.1.4"><sup id="EST.1.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
<span id="add-EST.1.4" class="usx-add">The celebration</span> lasted for six months. During that time the king showed his guests all his wealth and other things that showed how great his kingdom was (OR, how great a king he was).</p>
<p id="p-EST.1.4" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EST.1.5"><sup id="EST.1.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
At the end of those six months, the king invited people to another banquet. He invited to the banquet all the men who worked in the palace, including those who had important jobs and those who had unimportant jobs. <span id="add-EST.1.5" class="usx-add">This celebration</span> lasted for seven days. It was in the courtyard of the palace in Susa. <a href="#EST.1.6"><sup id="EST.1.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
<span id="add-EST.1.6" class="usx-add">In the courtyard</span> were beautiful blue and white curtains that were fastened by white and purple cords/ribbons to rings that were on pillars made from <span id="add-EST.1.6" class="usx-add">expensive white stone called</span> marble. <span id="add-EST.1.6" class="usx-add">The guests sat on</span> gold and silver couches. The couches were on a pavement/floor which had on top of it designs made from various kinds of expensive stones. <a href="#EST.1.7"><sup id="EST.1.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
<span id="add-EST.1.7" class="usx-add">The guests</span> drank wine from gold cups. Each cup had a different design on it. <a href="#EST.1.8"><sup id="EST.1.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
There was a lot of wine, because the king wanted the guests to drink as much as they wanted. But the king told the servants that they should not force anyone to drink more than he wanted.</p>
<p id="p-EST.1.8" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EST.1.9"><sup id="EST.1.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>

    <span id="add-EST.1.9" class="usx-add">At the same time, the king’s wife,</span> Queen Vashti, invited the wives of the men who worked in the palace to a banquet <span id="add-EST.1.9" class="usx-add">in another room in the palace</span>.</p>
<p id="p-EST.1.9" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EST.1.10"><sup id="EST.1.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
On the last/seventh day of those banquets, when King Xerxes was partially drunk from drinking wine, he <span id="add-EST.1.10" class="usx-add">summoned</span> seven of his personal servants. They were Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas. <a href="#EST.1.11"><sup id="EST.1.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
He told them to bring Queen Vashti to him, wearing her crown. He wanted his guests to see that she was very beautiful. <a href="#EST.1.12"><sup id="EST.1.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
But when those servants told Vashti what the king wanted, she refused to go to the king <span id="add-EST.1.12" class="usx-add">because she did not want to display her beauty in front of a group of half-drunk men</span>.</p>
<p id="p-EST.1.12" class="usx-p" >So that caused the king to become very angry. <a href="#EST.1.13-14"><sup id="EST.1.13-14" class="usx-v">13-14</sup></a>
Immediately he had a meeting with the seven men who were the most important officials in Persia and Media. They were the men whom he often asked ◄for their advice/what he should do►. And they were men who knew all the customs and laws <span id="add-EST.1.13-14" class="usx-add">of Persia</span>. Their names were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan. <a href="#EST.1.15"><sup id="EST.1.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
The king said to them, “Queen Vashti has refused to obey me when I sent my servants <span id="add-EST.1.15" class="usx-add">to tell her to come here</span>. What do our laws say that we should do to someone who <span id="add-EST.1.15" class="usx-add">acts/behaves like that</span>?”</p>
<p id="p-EST.1.15" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EST.1.16"><sup id="EST.1.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
While the other officials were present, Memucan told the king, <span id="add-EST.1.16" class="usx-add">“Your majesty</span>, Queen Vashti has ◄insulted/done wrong against► you, but she has also insulted all your officials and everyone else ◄in your empire/that you rule over►. <a href="#EST.1.17"><sup id="EST.1.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
All the women <span id="add-EST.1.17" class="usx-add">throughout the empire</span> will hear what she has done, and they will say, ‘The king commanded Queen Vashti to come to him, and she refused.’ <span id="add-EST.1.17" class="usx-add">So they will not obey their husbands. Instead,</span> they will begin to not respect their husbands. <a href="#EST.1.18"><sup id="EST.1.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
Before this day ends, the wives of all us officials in Persia and Media will hear what the queen did, and they also will refuse to obey their husbands. They will not respect us, and they will cause us to become very angry. <a href="#EST.1.19"><sup id="EST.1.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
So if it pleases you, O king, you should write a law. Like all the other laws of Persia and Media, it will be a law that ◄no one can change/cannot be changed.► Write a law that states that Queen Vashti will never be allowed to see you again <span id="add-EST.1.19" class="usx-add">and will not continue to be the queen</span>. Then you can choose another woman to be queen, a woman who deserves to be queen more than Vashti does. <a href="#EST.1.20"><sup id="EST.1.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
Then, when everyone in your empire hears what you have commanded, all the women, including those who are important and those who are not important, will respect and obey their husbands.”</p>
<p id="p-EST.1.20" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EST.1.21"><sup id="EST.1.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
The king and the other officials liked what Memucan suggested, so he <span id="add-EST.1.21" class="usx-add">did that. He wrote a law</span> proclaiming that. <a href="#EST.1.22"><sup id="EST.1.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
Then he sent letters to all the provinces, stating that all men should have complete authority over their wives and their children. He wrote the letters in every language and type of writing/alphabet that was used in each province.</p>
<a href="#EST.2"><h3 id="EST.2" class="usx-c">2</h3></a>
<p id="s1-EST.2" class="usx-s1" >Esther became the new queen</p>
<p id="p-EST.2" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EST.2.1"><sup id="EST.2.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
After a while, King Xerxes quit being so angry. He thought about Vashti, and he thought about the law he had made because of what she <span id="add-EST.2.1" class="usx-add">had done, and he wanted another wife</span>. <a href="#EST.2.2"><sup id="EST.2.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
So his personal servants said to him, “<span id="add-EST.2.2" class="usx-add">Your majesty,</span> you should send some men to search throughout the empire for some beautiful young women/virgins for you. <a href="#EST.2.3"><sup id="EST.2.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
<span id="add-EST.2.3" class="usx-add">After they find some,</span> you can appoint some officials in each province to bring them to the place where you keep ◄your wives/the women you sleep with► here in Susa. Then Hegai, the man who is in charge of these women, can arrange for ointments to be put <span id="add-EST.2.3" class="usx-add">on their bodies</span> to make them <span id="add-EST.2.3" class="usx-add">more</span> beautiful. <a href="#EST.2.4"><sup id="EST.2.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
Then the woman who pleases you most can become queen instead of Vashti.” The king liked what they suggested, so he did it.</p>
<p id="p-EST.2.4" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EST.2.5"><sup id="EST.2.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
At that time there was a Jew <span id="add-EST.2.5" class="usx-add">living</span> in Susa, the capital, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair. Jair was a descendant of Shimei. Shimei was a descendant of <span id="add-EST.2.5" class="usx-add">King Saul’s father</span> Kish. <span id="add-EST.2.5" class="usx-add">They were all</span> from the tribe descended from Benjamin. <a href="#EST.2.6"><sup id="EST.2.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
<span id="add-EST.2.6" class="usx-add">Many years before that,</span> King Nebuchadnezzar had taken ◄Mordecai/Mordecai’s family► <span id="add-EST.2.6" class="usx-add">and brought them from Jerusalem</span> to Babylon, at the same time he brought King Jehoiachin of Judah and many other people to Babylon. <a href="#EST.2.7"><sup id="EST.2.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Mordecai had a cousin whose <span id="add-EST.2.7" class="usx-add">Hebrew</span> name was Hadassah. She had a beautiful face and beautiful body/figure. Her <span id="add-EST.2.7" class="usx-add">Persian</span> name was Esther. After her father and mother died, Mordecai took care of Esther as though she were his own daughter. <a href="#EST.2.8"><sup id="EST.2.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
After the king commanded <span id="add-EST.2.8" class="usx-add">that they search for some beautiful women</span>, they brought Esther and many other young women to the king’s palace <span id="add-EST.2.8" class="usx-add">in Susa</span>, and ◄the king put Hegai/Hegai was put► in charge of them. <a href="#EST.2.9"><sup id="EST.2.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
Hegai was very pleased with Esther, and he treated her well. He immediately arranged for her to be given ointments to make her <span id="add-EST.2.9" class="usx-add">even more</span> beautiful, and <span id="add-EST.2.9" class="usx-add">he ordered that</span> special food <span id="add-EST.2.9" class="usx-add">would be given to her</span>. <span id="add-EST.2.9" class="usx-add">He arranged that</span> seven maids from the king’s palace <span id="add-EST.2.9" class="usx-add">would take care of her</span>, and arranged that she/they would stay in the best rooms.</p>
<p id="p-EST.2.9" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EST.2.10"><sup id="EST.2.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
Esther did not tell anyone that she was a Jew, because Mordecai had told her not to tell anyone. <a href="#EST.2.11"><sup id="EST.2.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
Every day Mordecai walked near the courtyard of the place where those women stayed. He asked <span id="add-EST.2.11" class="usx-add">people who entered the courtyard</span> to find out <span id="add-EST.2.11" class="usx-add">and tell him</span> what was happening to Esther.</p>
<p id="p-EST.2.11" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EST.2.12"><sup id="EST.2.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
Before these women were taken to the king, they put ointments on <span id="add-EST.2.12" class="usx-add">the bodies of</span> these women for one year to make them more beautiful. For six months they <span id="add-EST.2.12" class="usx-add">rubbed olive</span> oil mixed with myrrh <span id="add-EST.2.12" class="usx-add">on their bodies each day</span>. For <span id="add-EST.2.12" class="usx-add">the next</span> six months they rubbed ointments and perfumes on their bodies. <a href="#EST.2.13"><sup id="EST.2.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Then, when one of these women <span id="add-EST.2.13" class="usx-add">was summoned to</span> go to the king, she was allowed to wear whatever clothes and jewelry she chose. <a href="#EST.2.14"><sup id="EST.2.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
In the evening, they would take her <span id="add-EST.2.14" class="usx-add">to the king’s own room</span>. The next morning, they would take her to another place where the women <span id="add-EST.2.14" class="usx-add">who had slept with the king</span> stayed. There another official whose name was Shaashgaz was in charge <span id="add-EST.2.14" class="usx-add">of those women</span>. <span id="add-EST.2.14" class="usx-add">Those women would live there for the rest of their lives, and</span> one of those women would go back to the king again only if the king very much wanted her to come again, and only if he told Shaashgaz the name of the woman.</p>
<p id="p-EST.2.14" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EST.2.15-16"><sup id="EST.2.15-16" class="usx-v">15-16</sup></a>
Everyone who saw Esther liked her. After King Xerxes had been ruling for seven years, it was Esther’s turn to go to him. When they took her to the king, it was during the middle part of the winter. She wore only the things that Hegai suggested. <a href="#EST.2.17"><sup id="EST.2.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
The king liked Esther more than he liked any of the other women <span id="add-EST.2.17" class="usx-add">that they brought to him</span>. He liked her so much that he put on her head the queen’s crown, and he declared that Esther would be the queen instead of Vashti. <a href="#EST.2.18"><sup id="EST.2.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
To celebrate her <span id="add-EST.2.18" class="usx-add">becoming the queen</span>, he had a big banquet/feast prepared for all his administrators and <span id="add-EST.2.18" class="usx-add">other</span> officials. He generously gave <span id="add-EST.2.18" class="usx-add">expensive</span> gifts to everyone, and he declared that in all the provinces there would be a holiday, <span id="add-EST.2.18" class="usx-add">a time when people did not have to pay taxes</span>.</p>
<p id="p-EST.2.18" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EST.2.19"><sup id="EST.2.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
Later all those women who had spent a night with the king were gathered together again. By that time Mordecai had become an official at the palace. <a href="#EST.2.20"><sup id="EST.2.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
But Esther still did not tell anyone that she was a Jew. She continued to do what Mordecai had told her to do. <a href="#EST.2.21"><sup id="EST.2.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
One day when Mordecai was doing his work in the palace, two of the king’s officials were there. Their names were Bigthana and Teresh. They were the guards who stood outside the king’s own rooms. They became angry <span id="add-EST.2.21" class="usx-add">with the king</span>, and they were planning how they could assassinate/kill him. <a href="#EST.2.22"><sup id="EST.2.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
But Mordecai heard about what they were planning, and he told that to Queen Esther. Then she told the king what Mordecai had found out. <a href="#EST.2.23"><sup id="EST.2.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
The king investigated and found out that Mordecai’s report was true. So the king ordered that those two men be hanged. When that was done, ◄an official wrote a report/a report was written► about it in a book called ‘The book that records what happened while Xerxes was king’.</p>
<a href="#EST.3"><h3 id="EST.3" class="usx-c">3</h3></a>
<p id="s1-EST.3" class="usx-s1" >Haman planned to kill to the Jews</p>
<p id="p-EST.3" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EST.3.1"><sup id="EST.3.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
Some time later, King Xerxes ◄promoted/gave his most important job/work to► Haman, the son of Hammedatha, who was a descendant of <span id="add-EST.3.1" class="usx-add">King</span> Agag. Haman became more important than all his other officials. <span id="add-EST.3.1" class="usx-add">Only the king was more important.</span> <a href="#EST.3.2"><sup id="EST.3.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
Then the king commanded that all the other officials had to bow down in front of Haman to honor him <span id="add-EST.3.2" class="usx-add">when he walked by</span>. But Mordecai refused to bow down to Haman.</p>
<p id="p-EST.3.2" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EST.3.3"><sup id="EST.3.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
The <span id="add-EST.3.3" class="usx-add">other</span> officials <span id="add-EST.3.3" class="usx-add">saw that, and they</span> asked Mordecai, “Why do you disobey what the king commanded?” <a href="#EST.3.4"><sup id="EST.3.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
Mordecai told them that he was a Jew, <span id="add-EST.3.4" class="usx-add">and that Jews would bow down only to God</span>. Day after day the other officials spoke to Mordecai about that, but he still refused to obey. So they told Haman about it, to see if Haman would tolerate it.</p>
<p id="p-EST.3.4" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EST.3.5"><sup id="EST.3.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
When Haman saw that Mordecai would not bow down to him, he became extremely angry. <a href="#EST.3.6"><sup id="EST.3.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
<span id="add-EST.3.6" class="usx-add">After he found out that Mordecai was a Jew,</span> he decided that it would not be enough to get rid of only Mordecai. He decided to kill all the Jews in all the area that Xerxes ruled.</p>
<p id="p-EST.3.6" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EST.3.7"><sup id="EST.3.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
So, during the twelfth year that Xerxes was ruling, during the month of April, <span id="add-EST.3.7" class="usx-add">Haman told his advisors to</span> ◄cast lots/throw small marked stones► to determine the best month and the best day to kill the Jews. Haman’s advisors did that, and the day that was selected was March 7th <span id="add-EST.3.7" class="usx-add">during the following/next year</span>.</p>
<p id="p-EST.3.7" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EST.3.8"><sup id="EST.3.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
Then Haman <span id="add-EST.3.8" class="usx-add">went to</span> the king <span id="add-EST.3.8" class="usx-add">and</span> said to <span id="add-EST.3.8" class="usx-add">him</span>, “<span id="add-EST.3.8" class="usx-add">Your majesty,</span> there is a certain group of people who live in many areas <span id="add-EST.3.8" class="usx-add">of your empire</span> whose customs are different from ours.

If it pleases you, command that they should all be killed. <span id="add-EST.3.9" class="usx-add">If you do that,</span> I will give ◄375 tons/750,000 pounds► of silver to your administrators so that you can use it for your government.”</p>
<p id="p-EST.3.9" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EST.3.10"><sup id="EST.3.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
The king liked <span id="add-EST.3.10" class="usx-add">what Haman said, so, and to confirm what he decided</span>, he gave the ring that had his official seal on it to Haman, who now hated the Jews. <a href="#EST.3.11"><sup id="EST.3.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
The king told Haman, “Keep your money, but do what you want to with those people <span id="add-EST.3.11" class="usx-add">whom you talked about</span>!”</p>

On April 17th Haman summoned the king’s secretaries, and he dictated a letter to them that they <span id="add-EST.3.12-13" class="usx-add">translated and</span> wrote to all the governors and administrators and other officials in all the provinces. They wrote copies of the letter in every language and every kind of writing/alphabet that was used in the empire. They wrote that all the Jews, <span id="add-EST.3.12-13" class="usx-add">including</span> young people and old people, women and children, had to be killed on one day. That day was March 7th of the following year. They also wrote that <span id="add-EST.3.12-13" class="usx-add">those who killed the Jews</span> could take everything that belonged to the Jews. <span id="add-EST.3.12-13" class="usx-add">They signed</span> the king’s name <span id="add-EST.3.12-13" class="usx-add">at the end of</span> the letters. Then they sealed the letters <span id="add-EST.3.12-13" class="usx-add">with wax, and stamped the wax by</span> using the king’s ring. Then they sent the letters swiftly to every province in the empire,</p>

    <a href="#EST.3.14"><sup id="EST.3.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
The king <span id="add-EST.3.14" class="usx-add">also commanded that</span> copies of these letters should be <span id="add-EST.3.14" class="usx-add">nailed up</span> where <span id="add-EST.3.14" class="usx-add">all the people</span> could see them, in every province, so that the people would be ready to do on the day the king had set <span id="add-EST.3.14" class="usx-add">what was written in the letter</span>. <a href="#EST.3.15"><sup id="EST.3.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
Then, according to what the king commanded, men <span id="add-EST.3.15" class="usx-add">riding horses</span> took those letters quickly to every province <span id="add-EST.3.15" class="usx-add">in the empire</span>. And one of the letters was read <span id="add-EST.3.15" class="usx-add">aloud to the people</span> in the capital city, Susa. Then the king and Haman sat down and drank <span id="add-EST.3.15" class="usx-add">wine</span>, but the people in Susa were very perplexed <span id="add-EST.3.15" class="usx-add">about why this was going to happen</span>.</p>

    <a href="#EST.4.1"><sup id="EST.4.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
When Mordecai found out about those <span id="add-EST.4.1" class="usx-add">letters, he was so anguished that</span> he tore his clothes and put on <span id="add-EST.4.1" class="usx-add">rough</span> sackcloth and <span id="add-EST.4.1" class="usx-add">threw</span> ashes over himself. Then he went into the city, crying very loudly. <a href="#EST.4.2"><sup id="EST.4.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
He stood outside the gate of the palace, because no one who was wearing sackcloth was allowed to enter the palace. <a href="#EST.4.3"><sup id="EST.4.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
In every province <span id="add-EST.4.3" class="usx-add">of the empire</span>, when the letter from the king was read to the Jewish people, they cried and mourned. They ◄fasted/abstained from eating food►, and wailed loudly.

When Esther’s maids and other officials came to her and told her what Mordecai had done, she was very distressed. So she sent to Mordecai <span id="add-EST.4.4" class="usx-add">some good</span> clothes to wear instead of the sackcloth, but he refused to take them. <a href="#EST.4.5"><sup id="EST.4.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
Then Esther summoned Hathach, one of the king’s officials whom he had appointed to help take care of Esther. She told him to go <span id="add-EST.4.5" class="usx-add">out and talk</span> to Mordecai to find out what was distressing him and why <span id="add-EST.4.5" class="usx-add">he was wearing sackcloth to show</span> that he was grieving. <a href="#EST.4.6"><sup id="EST.4.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
Hathach went to Mordecai, who was in the plaza in front of the palace gate. <a href="#EST.4.7"><sup id="EST.4.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Mordecai told him everything that had happened. He told him how much money Haman had promised to give to the government if the king commanded that all the Jews be killed. <a href="#EST.4.8"><sup id="EST.4.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
Mordecai also gave to Hathach a copy of the decree that had been read in Susa, <span id="add-EST.4.8" class="usx-add">in which it was stated</span> that all the Jews must be killed. He told Hathach to show the copy to Esther. He told Hathach to explain to Esther what ◄it meant/would happen►. Then he told him to urge her to go to the king and request the king to act mercifully to her people. <a href="#EST.4.9"><sup id="EST.4.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
So Hathach returned to Esther and told her what Mordecai said. <a href="#EST.4.10"><sup id="EST.4.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
Then Esther told Hathach to <span id="add-EST.4.10" class="usx-add">return to</span> Mordecai <span id="add-EST.4.10" class="usx-add">and</span> tell this <span id="add-EST.4.10" class="usx-add">to him</span>: <a href="#EST.4.11"><sup id="EST.4.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
“There is a law <span id="add-EST.4.11" class="usx-add">about people going to talk to the king</span>. All the king’s officials and all the people in the empire know this law. <span id="add-EST.4.11" class="usx-add">In that law it states that</span> anyone who goes to the king in his inner court without having been summoned by the king must be executed.

So Hathach <span id="add-EST.4.12" class="usx-add">went back to</span> Mordecai <span id="add-EST.4.12" class="usx-add">and</span> told <span id="add-EST.4.12" class="usx-add">him</span> what Esther had said. <a href="#EST.4.13"><sup id="EST.4.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Mordecai replied, “<span id="add-EST.4.13" class="usx-add">Go back and</span> tell this to Esther: &#39;Do not think that just because you live there in the palace, you will escape when all the other Jews <span id="add-EST.4.13" class="usx-add">are killed</span>. <a href="#EST.4.14"><sup id="EST.4.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
If you say nothing now, someone from some other place will rescue <span id="add-EST.4.14" class="usx-add">many of</span> us Jews, but you and your relatives will be killed.

Then <span id="add-EST.4.15" class="usx-add">after Hathach told this to</span> Esther, <span id="add-EST.4.15" class="usx-add">she </span> told him to return to Mordecai and say this to him: <a href="#EST.4.16"><sup id="EST.4.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
“Gather together all the Jews here in Susa, and tell them to ◄fast/abstain from food► for my sake. Tell them to not eat or drink anything for three days and nights. My maids and I will also fast. Then, I will go to talk to the king. Even if ◄I am executed/they execute me► for disobeying the law <span id="add-EST.4.16" class="usx-add">by seeing him when he does not hold out the scepter/staff toward me, I am willing for that to happen”</span>. <a href="#EST.4.17"><sup id="EST.4.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
So <span id="add-EST.4.17" class="usx-add">after Hathach told this to Mordecai,</span> Mordecai went and did what Esther told him to do.</p>

    <a href="#EST.5.1"><sup id="EST.5.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
Three days later, Esther <span id="add-EST.5.1" class="usx-add">prepared a big banquet/feast. Then she </span> put on the robes that showed that she was queen, and she went to the inner courtyard of the palace, across from the room where the king was.

When the king saw Esther standing there in the courtyard, he extended the gold scepter/staff toward her <span id="add-EST.5.2" class="usx-add">to signal that he would be glad to talk to her</span>. So Esther came close and touched the tip of the scepter/staff. <a href="#EST.5.3"><sup id="EST.5.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
Then the king asked her, “Esther, what do you want? Tell me, and I will give you what you want, even if you ask me to give you half of my kingdom!” <a href="#EST.5.4"><sup id="EST.5.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>

The king said <span id="add-EST.5.5" class="usx-add">to his servants</span>, “Go and tell Haman to come quickly to a banquet that Esther has prepared for the two of us!” So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared for them. <a href="#EST.5.6"><sup id="EST.5.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
While they were drinking wine, the king said to Esther, “Tell me what you <span id="add-EST.5.6" class="usx-add">really</span> want.

Haman was feeling very happy as he left the banquet. But then he saw Mordecai sitting at the gate of the palace. Mordecai did not stand up and tremble fearfully in front of Haman, so Haman became extremely angry. <a href="#EST.5.10"><sup id="EST.5.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
However, he did not show that he was angry; he <span id="add-EST.5.10" class="usx-add">just</span> went home. Then he gathered together his wife Zeresh and his friends, <a href="#EST.5.11"><sup id="EST.5.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
and he boasted to them about being very rich, and about having many children. He also boasted that the king had greatly honored him, and that the king had ◄promoted him/given him the second-most important job in the empire►, so that <span id="add-EST.5.11" class="usx-add">all</span> the other officials had to respect him. <a href="#EST.5.12"><sup id="EST.5.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
Then Haman added, “And that is not all! Queen Esther invited just two of us, the king and me, to a banquet she prepared for us today.

Then Haman said, “But those things ◄mean nothing to me/do not make me happy► while I keep seeing that Jew, Mordecai, <span id="add-EST.5.13" class="usx-add">just</span> sitting there at the gate of the palace <span id="add-EST.5.13" class="usx-add">and ignoring me</span>!” <a href="#EST.5.14"><sup id="EST.5.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
So Haman’s wife Zeresh and all his friends <span id="add-EST.5.14" class="usx-add">who were there</span> suggested, “<span id="add-EST.5.14" class="usx-add">Why don’t you quickly</span> set up ◄a gallows/posts on which to hang someone►.

That night the king was unable to sleep, so he <span id="add-EST.6.1" class="usx-add">summoned</span> a servant <span id="add-EST.6.1" class="usx-add">and </span> told <span id="add-EST.6.1" class="usx-add">him </span> to bring the records of what had happened during all the time he had been king. <span id="add-EST.6.1" class="usx-add">So the servant brought the records</span> and read some of them to the king. <a href="#EST.6.2"><sup id="EST.6.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
<span id="add-EST.6.2" class="usx-add">The servant read about</span> Bigthana and Teresh, the two men who had guarded the entrance to the king’s rooms.

The king asked <span id="add-EST.6.3" class="usx-add">some of his servants</span>, “What did we do to reward Mordecai or show that we appreciate what he did?” The servants replied, “We did not do anything for him.” <a href="#EST.6.4"><sup id="EST.6.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
At that moment, Haman entered the outer courtyard of the palace. He wanted to talk to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had <span id="add-EST.6.4" class="usx-add">just</span> set up. The king <span id="add-EST.6.4" class="usx-add">saw him and</span> said, “Who is <span id="add-EST.6.4" class="usx-add">that out there</span> in the courtyard?” <a href="#EST.6.5"><sup id="EST.6.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>

When Haman came in, the king asked him, “What should I do for a man whom I want to honor?” Haman thought to himself, “◄Whom would the king like to honor more than me?/I think there is no one whom the king would like to honor more than me!►” [RHQ] <a href="#EST.6.7"><sup id="EST.6.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
So he replied to the king, “If there is someone you wish to honor, <a href="#EST.6.8"><sup id="EST.6.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
you should <span id="add-EST.6.8" class="usx-add">tell your servants to</span> bring him one of the robes you wear <span id="add-EST.6.8" class="usx-add">you to show that you are</span> the king.

Then tell one of your very important officials to put the robe on the man whom you want to honor, and tell that man to sit on the horse, and then lead the horse through the city streets.

The king replied to Haman, “<span id="add-EST.6.10" class="usx-add">Fine</span>! Go and do what you said immediately! Get my robe and my horse, and do just what you suggested!

Do not forget anything that you suggested!” <a href="#EST.6.11"><sup id="EST.6.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
So Haman did what the king said. He got the robe and the horse. He put the robe on Mordecai, and as Mordecai sat on the horse, Haman led the horse through the city streets proclaiming “This is what the king ◄does/is doing► for the man whom the king wants to honor!” <a href="#EST.6.12"><sup id="EST.6.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
Then, Mordecai returned <span id="add-EST.6.12" class="usx-add">and sat</span> at the gate of the palace.

He told his wife Zeresh and his friends everything that had happened to him that day.

The king became extremely angry. He immediately left his wine and got up and went outside into the palace garden <span id="add-EST.7.7" class="usx-add">to decide what to do</span>.

The king held out his gold scepter/staff toward Esther, so Esther arose and stood in front of him. <a href="#EST.8.5"><sup id="EST.8.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
She said, “Your majesty, if you are pleased with me, and if you think that it is the right thing to do, make a new law to cancel what Haman decreed, that all the Jews in all the provinces in your empire should be killed. <a href="#EST.8.6"><sup id="EST.8.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
I cannot bear seeing all my family and <span id="add-EST.8.6" class="usx-add">all the rest of</span> my people killed.” <a href="#EST.8.7"><sup id="EST.8.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
King Xerxes replied to Queen Esther and Mordecai, “Because Haman tried to get rid of all the Jews, I have given to Esther everything that belonged to Haman, and I have ordered <span id="add-EST.8.7" class="usx-add">my soldiers</span> to hang Haman. <a href="#EST.8.8"><sup id="EST.8.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
So now I am also permitting you to write other letters, to <span id="add-EST.8.8" class="usx-add">save</span> your people. You may put my name <span id="add-EST.8.8" class="usx-add">on the letters</span>, and use my ring to seal them because no letter that has my name on it and which is sealed with my ring can ever be changed.” <a href="#EST.8.9"><sup id="EST.8.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
Then the king summoned his secretaries, on June 25th, and <span id="add-EST.8.9" class="usx-add">Mordecai told them to</span> write letters to the Jews and to all the governors and other officials in all of the 127 provinces, which extended from India <span id="add-EST.8.9" class="usx-add">in the east</span> to Ethiopia <span id="add-EST.8.9" class="usx-add">in the west</span>. They wrote these letters in all the languages that the people in each area spoke. They also wrote letters to the Jewish people, in their language. <a href="#EST.8.10-11"><sup id="EST.8.10-11" class="usx-v">10-11</sup></a>
They wrote in those letters that the Jews in every city were permitted by the king to gather together to protect themselves. They also were permitted to kill any group of soldiers who attacked them. They were also permitted to kill the women and children of those who attacked them, and to take the possessions of the people whom they killed. <a href="#EST.8.12"><sup id="EST.8.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
<span id="add-EST.8.12" class="usx-add">All this was to be done</span> on March 7th of the following year. Mordecai signed the king’s name on the letters, and sealed them with the seal that was on the king’s ring. Then he gave them to messengers, who rode on fast horses that had been raised especially for the king. <a href="#EST.8.13"><sup id="EST.8.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Copies of this law were to be nailed to posts in every province and read to all the people, in order that the Jews would be ready to ◄get revenge on/fight against► their enemies on March 7th. <a href="#EST.8.14"><sup id="EST.8.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
The king commanded the men who took these letters <span id="add-EST.8.14" class="usx-add">to all the provinces</span> to ride quickly on the king’s horses. And copies of the letter were also posted and read to the people in <span id="add-EST.8.14" class="usx-add">the capital city,</span> Susa. <a href="#EST.8.15"><sup id="EST.8.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
Before Mordecai left the palace, he put on the blue and white robe and a large gold crown that the king had given him. He also put on a coat made of fine purple cloth. When the people in Susa heard the new law, they all shouted and cheered. <a href="#EST.8.16"><sup id="EST.8.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
The Jews in Susa were very happy, and <span id="add-EST.8.16" class="usx-add">other people</span> honored <span id="add-EST.8.16" class="usx-add">them</span>. <a href="#EST.8.17"><sup id="EST.8.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
And when the new law arrived in every city and province, the Jews there celebrated and prepared feasts and were very joyful. And many men throughout the empire <span id="add-EST.8.17" class="usx-add">were circumcised and</span> became Jews, because they were now afraid of <span id="add-EST.8.17" class="usx-add">what</span> the Jews <span id="add-EST.8.17" class="usx-add">would do to them if they were not Jews</span>.</p>
<a href="#EST.9"><h3 id="EST.9" class="usx-c">9</h3></a>
<p id="p-EST.9" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EST.9.1"><sup id="EST.9.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
The first law that the king had commanded was to be made effective on March 7th. On that day the enemies of the Jews hoped to get rid of them. But instead, on that same day the Jews defeated their enemies. <a href="#EST.9.2"><sup id="EST.9.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
Throughout the empire, the Jews gathered together in their cities to attack those who wanted to get rid of them. No one could fight against the Jews, because all the other people in the areas where the Jews lived were afraid of them, <span id="add-EST.9.2" class="usx-add">so they did not want to help anyone who attacked the Jews</span>. <a href="#EST.9.3"><sup id="EST.9.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
All the governors and <span id="add-EST.9.3" class="usx-add">other</span> officials and important people in all the provinces helped the Jews, because they were afraid of Mordecai. <a href="#EST.9.4"><sup id="EST.9.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
They were afraid of him because in all the provinces <span id="add-EST.9.4" class="usx-add">they knew that</span> Mordecai was now the king’s most important official, <span id="add-EST.9.4" class="usx-add">with the authority that Haman previously had</span>. Mordecai was becoming more famous because <span id="add-EST.9.4" class="usx-add">the king was giving him</span> more and more power. <a href="#EST.9.5"><sup id="EST.9.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
<span id="add-EST.9.5" class="usx-add">On March 7th,</span> the Jews attacked and killed with their swords all of their enemies. They did whatever they wanted to do, to the people who hated them. <a href="#EST.9.6"><sup id="EST.9.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
<span id="add-EST.9.6" class="usx-add">Just</span> in Susa alone, the capital city, they killed 500 people. <a href="#EST.9.7"><sup id="EST.9.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Among those whom they killed were the ten sons of Haman. <span id="add-EST.9.7" class="usx-add">Their names were</span> Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, <a href="#EST.9.8"><sup id="EST.9.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, <a href="#EST.9.9"><sup id="EST.9.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha. <a href="#EST.9.10"><sup id="EST.9.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
Those were grandsons of Hammedatha and sons of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. The Jews killed them, but they did not take the things that belonged to the people whom they killed. <a href="#EST.9.11"><sup id="EST.9.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
<span id="add-EST.9.11" class="usx-add">At the end of</span> that day someone reported to the king the number of people whom the Jews killed in Susa. <a href="#EST.9.12"><sup id="EST.9.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
Then the king said to Queen Esther, “The Jews have killed 500 people here in Susa, including the ten sons of Haman! <span id="add-EST.9.12" class="usx-add">So I think that</span> they must have killed many more people in the rest of my empire [RHQ]! <span id="add-EST.9.12" class="usx-add">But okay</span>, now what else do you want me to do for you. You tell me, and I will do it.” <a href="#EST.9.13"><sup id="EST.9.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Esther replied, “If it pleases you, allow the Jews here in Susa to do again tomorrow what <span id="add-EST.9.13" class="usx-add">you</span> commanded <span id="add-EST.9.13" class="usx-add">them</span> to do today. And command that the bodies of Haman’s ten sons be hanged on the gallows/poles.” <a href="#EST.9.14"><sup id="EST.9.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
So the king commanded that the Jews be permitted to kill more of their enemies the next day. After he issued <span id="add-EST.9.14" class="usx-add">another</span> order in Susa, the bodies of Haman’s ten sons were hanged. <a href="#EST.9.15"><sup id="EST.9.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
On the next day, the Jews in Susa gathered together and killed 300 more people. But <span id="add-EST.9.15" class="usx-add">again,</span> they did not take the things that belonged to the people whom they killed. <a href="#EST.9.16"><sup id="EST.9.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
That happened on March 8th. On the following day, the Jews <span id="add-EST.9.16" class="usx-add">in Susa</span> rested and celebrated. In all the other provinces, the Jewish people gathered together to defend themselves, and they killed 75,000 people who hated them, but <span id="add-EST.9.16" class="usx-add">again</span> they did not take the things that belonged to the people whom they killed. <a href="#EST.9.17"><sup id="EST.9.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
That occurred on March 7th, and on the following day they rested and celebrated. <a href="#EST.9.18"><sup id="EST.9.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
After the Jews in Susa gathered together <span id="add-EST.9.18" class="usx-add">and killed their enemies</span> on March 7th and 8th, they rested and celebrated on March 9th. <a href="#EST.9.19"><sup id="EST.9.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
That is why <span id="add-EST.9.19" class="usx-add">every year</span>, on March 8th, the Jews who live in villages now celebrate <span id="add-EST.9.19" class="usx-add">defeating their enemies</span>. They have feasts and give gifts <span id="add-EST.9.19" class="usx-add">of food</span> to each other. <a href="#EST.9.20"><sup id="EST.9.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
Mordecai wrote down all the things that had happened. Then he sent letters to the Jews who lived throughout the empire of King Xerxes. <a href="#EST.9.21"><sup id="EST.9.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
He told them that every year they should celebrate on the 8th and 9th of March, <a href="#EST.9.22"><sup id="EST.9.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
because those were the days when the Jews got rid of their enemies. He also told them that they should celebrate on those days by feasting and giving gifts <span id="add-EST.9.22" class="usx-add">of food</span> to each other and to poor people. They would remember it as the month in which they changed from being very sorrowful to being very joyful, from crying to celebrating. <a href="#EST.9.23"><sup id="EST.9.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
So the Jews agreed to do what Mordecai wrote. They agreed to celebrate on those days <span id="add-EST.9.23" class="usx-add">every year</span>. <a href="#EST.9.24"><sup id="EST.9.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
They would remember how Haman, son of Hammedatha, a descendant of <span id="add-EST.9.24" class="usx-add">King</span> Agag, became an enemy of all the Jews. <span id="add-EST.9.24" class="usx-add">They would remember</span> how he had made an evil plan to kill the Jews, and that he had ◄cast lots/thrown small marked stones► to choose the day to kill [DOU] them. <a href="#EST.9.25"><sup id="EST.9.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
<span id="add-EST.9.25" class="usx-add">They would remember</span> that when Esther told the king about Haman’s plan, the king arranged that the evil plan that Haman had made to kill the Jews would fail, and that he <span id="add-EST.9.25" class="usx-add">would be killed</span> instead of the Jews, and that Haman and that his sons were hanged. <a href="#EST.9.26"><sup id="EST.9.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
<span id="add-EST.9.26" class="usx-add">Because the ◄lot/small marked stone► that Haman threw was called</span> Pur, the Jews called these days Purim. And, because of everything that ◄<span id="add-EST.9.26" class="usx-add">Mordecai</span> wrote/was written► in that letter, and because of all that happened to them, <a href="#EST.9.27"><sup id="EST.9.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
the Jews <span id="add-EST.9.27" class="usx-add">throughout the empire</span> agreed to celebrate in that manner on those two days every year. They said that they would tell their descendants and those people who became Jews to be certain to celebrate this festival every year. They should celebrate just as <span id="add-EST.9.27" class="usx-add">Mordecai</span> told them to do <span id="add-EST.9.27" class="usx-add">in the letter</span> that he wrote. <a href="#EST.9.28"><sup id="EST.9.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
They said that they would remember and celebrate on those two days every year, in each family, in every city, and in every province. They solemnly declared that they and their descendants would never stop remembering and celebrating those days called Purim. <a href="#EST.9.29"><sup id="EST.9.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>
Then Mordecai and Queen Esther, who was the daughter of Abihail, wrote a second letter about the Purim feast. Esther used the authority that she had because of being the queen to confirm that what Mordecai had written in the first letter was true. <a href="#EST.9.30-31"><sup id="EST.9.30-31" class="usx-v">30-31</sup></a>
What they wrote <span id="add-EST.9.30-31" class="usx-add">in the second letter</span> was, “We wish that all of you will be living peacefully and safely/righteously. We want you and your descendants to celebrate Purim each year on the days that we two established, and to do the things that we two told you to do.” In that letter, Queen Esther and Mordecai also gave them instructions about ◄fasting/abstaining from eating food► and being sorrowful. Then copies of that letter were sent to all the Jews who were living in the 127 provinces of the empire. <a href="#EST.9.32"><sup id="EST.9.32" class="usx-v">32</sup></a>
The letter that Esther wrote about the manner in which they should celebrate the Purim feast was also written in an official record.</p>
<a href="#EST.10"><h3 id="EST.10" class="usx-c">10</h3></a>
<p id="p-EST.10" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EST.10.1"><sup id="EST.10.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
King Xerxes required that all the people in his empire pay taxes. Even the people who lived on the islands <span id="add-EST.10.1" class="usx-add">in the Mediterranean Sea</span> (OR, in coastal areas) were required to pay taxes. <a href="#EST.10.2"><sup id="EST.10.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
And all the great and powerful things that Xerxes did were written in the scroll called/entitled ‘The record of the things done by the kings of Media and Persia’. In this book were also written <span id="add-EST.10.2" class="usx-add">the things done</span> by Mordecai, the man whom the king had greatly honored. <a href="#EST.10.3"><sup id="EST.10.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
Mordecai, who was a Jew, became the king’s most important official, and <span id="add-EST.10.3" class="usx-add">all</span> the Jews also considered him to be a very great man. They <span id="add-EST.10.3" class="usx-add">all</span> respected him, because he did many good things for the Jews, and he often asked <span id="add-EST.10.3" class="usx-add">the king</span> to do good things for them.</p>
