King Agrippa and Bernice stayed many days in Caesarea. While <span id="add-ACT.25.14" class="usx-add">they were</span> there, Festus told Agrippa about Paul. He said to the king, “There is a man here whom Felix kept in prison <span id="add-ACT.25.14" class="usx-add">while he was governor</span>.

When I went to Jerusalem, the chief priests and <span id="add-ACT.25.15" class="usx-add">the other</span> Jewish elders told me that this man had done many things <span id="add-ACT.25.15" class="usx-add">against their laws</span>.

But I told them that when someone has been accused <span id="add-ACT.25.16" class="usx-add">of a crime, we</span> Romans do not immediately ◄condemn that person/declare that person to be guilty►. First, we <span id="add-ACT.25.16" class="usx-add">command</span> him to stand before the people who are accusing him and to say whether or not he has done those things. <span id="add-ACT.25.16" class="usx-add">After that, the judge will decide what to do with</span> him. <a href="#ACT.25.17"><sup id="ACT.25.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>

I did not know what questions to ask <span id="add-ACT.25.20" class="usx-add">them, and I did not know how to judge</span> concerning their dispute.

“Men, I perceive that <span id="add-ACT.27.10" class="usx-add">if we(inc) travel by ship</span> now, it will be disastrous for us. A storm may destroy the ship and the cargo, and possibly we will drown.” <a href="#ACT.27.11"><sup id="ACT.27.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
But the officer <span id="add-ACT.27.11" class="usx-add">did not listen to</span> what Paul said.

The harbor where the ship had stopped was not a good place to remain during the winter <span id="add-ACT.27.12" class="usx-add">when the weather frequently becomes stormy. So most of the people on the ship decided that we(exc) should leave there, because they hoped that we</span> could stay at Phoenix <span id="add-ACT.27.12" class="usx-add">port</span> during the winter, if we could possibly arrive there. That harbor was open to the sea in two directions, <span id="add-ACT.27.12" class="usx-add">but the strong winds did not blow there</span>. <a href="#ACT.27.13"><sup id="ACT.27.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>

It blew strongly against the <span id="add-ACT.27.15" class="usx-add">front of</span> the ship. The result was that we could not keep going in the direction <span id="add-ACT.27.15" class="usx-add">in which we had been going</span>.

After the sailors <span id="add-ACT.27.17-18" class="usx-add">hoisted/lifted</span> the lifeboat onto the ship, they tied ropes around the ship’s hull to strengthen the ship.

    <span id="add-ACT.28.28-29" class="usx-add">That is what God said to the prophet Isaiah about our ancestors. But you Jews today do not want to believe God’s message</span>. Therefore, I am telling you that <span id="add-ACT.28.28-29" class="usx-add">God</span> has sent to the non-Jews this message about how he saves people, and they will listen <span id="add-ACT.28.28-29" class="usx-add">and accept it</span>!”</p>

For two whole years Paul stayed <span id="add-ACT.28.30" class="usx-add">there</span> in a house that he rented. Many people came to see him, and he received them all gladly <span id="add-ACT.28.30" class="usx-add">and talked with them</span>. <a href="#ACT.28.31"><sup id="ACT.28.31" class="usx-v">31</sup></a>
He preached <span id="add-ACT.28.31" class="usx-add">and taught people</span> about how God could rule <span id="add-ACT.28.31" class="usx-add">their lives</span> [MET] and taught them about the Lord Jesus Christ. He did that without being afraid, and no one tried to stop him.</p>
