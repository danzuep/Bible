So, <span id="add-ACT.23.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in order to cause the Pharisees and Sadducees to argue among themselves instead of accusing him</span>, he called out loudly in the Council <span id="add-ACT.23.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">hall</span>, “My fellow Jews, I am a Pharisee, like my father was.

After several days, King <span id="add-ACT.25.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Herod</span> Agrippa arrived at Caesarea, along with <span id="add-ACT.25.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">his younger sister</span> Bernice.

King Agrippa and Bernice stayed many days in Caesarea.

He said to the king, “There is a man here whom Felix kept in prison <span id="add-ACT.25.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">while he was governor</span>. He left him <span id="add-ACT.25.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">there when his time as governor ended</span>. <a href="#ACT.25.15"><sup id="ACT.25.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
When I went to Jerusalem, the chief priests and <span id="add-ACT.25.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the other</span> Jewish elders told me that this man had done many things <span id="add-ACT.25.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">against their laws</span>.

After that</span>, the wind <span id="add-ACT.27.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">was very strong and</span> did not allow the ship to move straight ahead <span id="add-ACT.27.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">westward.

<span id="add-ACT.27.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">The wind was still strong, and it prevented the ship from moving ahead fast</span>.

But the officer <span id="add-ACT.27.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">did not listen to</span> what Paul said. Instead, he decided to do what the pilot <span id="add-ACT.27.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">of the ship</span> and the owner of the ship advised. <a href="#ACT.27.12"><sup id="ACT.27.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
The harbor where the ship had stopped was not a good place to remain during the winter <span id="add-ACT.27.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">when the weather frequently becomes stormy. So most of the people on the ship decided that we(exc) should leave there, because they hoped that we</span> could stay at Phoenix <span id="add-ACT.27.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">port</span> during the winter, if we could possibly arrive there. That harbor was open to the sea in two directions, <span id="add-ACT.27.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">but the strong winds did not blow there</span>. <a href="#ACT.27.13"><sup id="ACT.27.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Then a gentle wind began to blow <span id="add-ACT.27.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">from the south</span>, and the <span id="add-ACT.27.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">crew members</span> thought that they could travel as they had decided <span id="add-ACT.27.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to do. So</span> they lifted <span id="add-ACT.27.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the anchor up out of the sea</span>, and the ship sailed <span id="add-ACT.27.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">westward</span> along the <span id="add-ACT.27.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">southern</span> shore of Crete <span id="add-ACT.27.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Island</span>. <a href="#ACT.27.14"><sup id="ACT.27.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
But after a while, a wind that was very strong blew across the island <span id="add-ACT.27.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">from the north side and hit the ship. That wind was called</span> {<span id="add-ACT.27.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">People</span> called that wind} “the Northeast Wind.” <a href="#ACT.27.15"><sup id="ACT.27.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
It blew strongly against the <span id="add-ACT.27.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">front of</span> the ship. The result was that we could not keep going in the direction <span id="add-ACT.27.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in which we had been going</span>. So the sailors let the wind move the ship in the direction <span id="add-ACT.27.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that the wind</span> was blowing. <a href="#ACT.27.16"><sup id="ACT.27.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
The ship then passed a small island named Cauda.

Then <span id="add-ACT.27.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">while the ship was moving along</span>, the sailors lifted the lifeboat up <span id="add-ACT.27.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">out of the water</span> and tied it <span id="add-ACT.27.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">on the deck. But the strong wind made it</span> difficult even to do that. <a href="#ACT.27.17-18"><sup id="ACT.27.17-18" class="usx-v">17-18</sup></a>
After the sailors <span id="add-ACT.27.17-18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">hoisted/lifted</span> the lifeboat onto the ship, they tied ropes around the ship’s hull to strengthen the ship. The sailors were afraid that, <span id="add-ACT.27.17-18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">because the wind was pushing the ship</span>, it might run onto the sandbanks off the coast of Libya to the south <span id="add-ACT.27.17-18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and get stuck there. So</span> they lowered the largest sail <span id="add-ACT.27.17-18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">so that the ship would move slower. Even so</span>, the wind continued to move the ship along. <span id="add-ACT.27.17-18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">The wind and the waves</span> continued to toss the ship about roughly, so on the next day the sailors began to throw overboard the things that the ship was carrying. <a href="#ACT.27.19"><sup id="ACT.27.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
On the third <span id="add-ACT.27.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">day after the stormy wind had begun to blow</span>, the sailors/we [MTY] threw overboard <span id="add-ACT.27.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">most of</span> the sails, ropes, and poles, <span id="add-ACT.27.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in order to make the ship lighter</span>. <a href="#ACT.27.20"><sup id="ACT.27.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
The wind continued to blow very strongly, <span id="add-ACT.27.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and the sky was full of dark clouds</span> day and night. We could not see the sun or the stars for many days, <span id="add-ACT.27.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">so we could not determine where we were.

Paul gathered some sticks and put them on the fire.

Go to your fellow Israelites and tell them,</p>
<p id="q1-ACT.28.26" class="usx-q1" >‘You repeatedly listen <span id="add-ACT.28.26" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to the message of God</span>, but you never understand <span id="add-ACT.28.26" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">what God is saying</span>.</p>
<p id="q1-ACT.28.26" class="usx-q1" >You repeatedly look at and see <span id="add-ACT.28.26" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the things that God is doing</span>,</p>

God also said to the prophet,</p>
<p id="q1-ACT.28.27" class="usx-q1" >These people do not understand, because they have become stubborn.</p>
<p id="q1-ACT.28.27" class="usx-q1" >They have ears, but they do not understand what they hear,</p>
<p id="q1-ACT.28.27" class="usx-q1" >and they have closed their eyes <span id="add-ACT.28.27" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">because they do not want to see</span>.</p>
<p id="q1-ACT.28.27" class="usx-q1" >If they wanted to obey what I say to them, they might understand what they see <span id="add-ACT.28.27" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">me doing</span> and what they hear <span id="add-ACT.28.27" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">me saying</span>.</p>
<p id="q1-ACT.28.27" class="usx-q1" >Then they might turn from their sinful behavior and I would save them.’</p>

    <span id="add-ACT.28.28-29" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">That is what God said to the prophet Isaiah about our ancestors. But you Jews today do not want to believe God’s message</span>. Therefore, I am telling you that <span id="add-ACT.28.28-29" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">God</span> has sent to the non-Jews this message about how he saves people, and they will listen <span id="add-ACT.28.28-29" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and accept it</span>!”</p>

For two whole years Paul stayed <span id="add-ACT.28.30" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">there</span> in a house that he rented. Many people came to see him, and he received them all gladly <span id="add-ACT.28.30" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and talked with them</span>. <a href="#ACT.28.31"><sup id="ACT.28.31" class="usx-v">31</sup></a>
He preached <span id="add-ACT.28.31" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and taught people</span> about how God could rule <span id="add-ACT.28.31" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">their lives</span> [MET] and taught them about the Lord Jesus Christ. He did that without being afraid, and no one tried to stop him.</p>
