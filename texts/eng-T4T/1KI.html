When King David was very old [IDM, DOU], even though his servants put many blankets on top of him, he was unable to become warm. <a href="#1KI.1.2"><sup id="1KI.1.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
So they said to him, “Your Majesty, allow us to search for a young virgin who can stay with you and take care of you. She can sleep close to you and enable you to become warm.”</p>

    <span id="add-1KI.1.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">The king gave them permission, </span> so they searched throughout Israel for a beautiful young woman. They found a woman named Abishag, from Shunem <span id="add-1KI.1.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">town</span>, and brought her to the king. <a href="#1KI.1.4"><sup id="1KI.1.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
She was <span id="add-1KI.1.4" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">truly</span> very beautiful. She took care of [DOU] the king, but the king did not have sexual relations with her.</p>

    <span id="add-1KI.1.5-6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">After Absalom died</span>, David’s oldest surviving son was Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith. He was a very handsome/good-looking man. But David had never rebuked him about anything he did. <span id="add-1KI.1.5-6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">After Absalom died, Adonijah thought that he would become king</span>. So he started to boast, saying “I will become king <span id="add-1KI.1.5-6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">now</span>.” Then he provided for himself some chariots, and men to drive them, and horses <span id="add-1KI.1.5-6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to pull them</span>, and 50 men to run <span id="add-1KI.1.5-6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">as his bodyguards</span> in front of those chariots <span id="add-1KI.1.5-6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">wherever he went</span>.</p>
<p id="p-1KI.1.5-6" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.1.7"><sup id="1KI.1.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
One day he conferred with Joab, <span id="add-1KI.1.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">David’s army commander</span>, and Abiathar the priest, and they promised/agreed to help/support Adonijah. <a href="#1KI.1.8"><sup id="1KI.1.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
But Zadok, who was also a priest, Benaiah <span id="add-1KI.1.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">who had supervised David’s bodyguards</span>, Nathan the prophet, Shimei and Rei, and David’s most capable soldiers refused to help/support Adonijah.</p>
<p id="p-1KI.1.8" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.1.9"><sup id="1KI.1.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
One day Adonijah went to Snake Rock near En-Rogel <span id="add-1KI.1.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Spring, which is near Jerusalem</span>, to sacrifice some sheep and oxen and fattened cattle. He invited most of his brothers, King David’s other sons, to come. He also invited all of the king’s officials from Judah to come to the celebration. <a href="#1KI.1.10"><sup id="1KI.1.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
But he did not invite Nathan or Benaiah or the king’s most capable soldiers or his <span id="add-1KI.1.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">younger/half</span>-brother Solomon.</p>
<p id="p-1KI.1.10" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.1.11"><sup id="1KI.1.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
Nathan <span id="add-1KI.1.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">found out what they were doing, so he went to</span> Solomon’s mother Bathsheba <span id="add-1KI.1.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and</span> asked her, “Have you not heard that Haggith’s son Adonijah is declared himself to be the king? And King David does not know about it! <a href="#1KI.1.12"><sup id="1KI.1.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
So if you want to save yourself and your son Solomon from being killed, allow me to tell you what you should do. <a href="#1KI.1.13"><sup id="1KI.1.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Go immediately to King David. Say to him, ‘Your Majesty, you solemnly promised me [RHQ] that my son Solomon would become the king after you <span id="add-1KI.1.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">die</span>, and that he would sit on your throne <span id="add-1KI.1.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and rule</span>. So why is it that Adonijah <span id="add-1KI.1.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">has said that he</span> is now the king?’ <a href="#1KI.1.14"><sup id="1KI.1.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
Then, while you are still talking to the king, I will come in and tell him that what you are saying to him <span id="add-1KI.1.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">about Adonijah</span> is true.”</p>
<p id="p-1KI.1.14" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.1.15"><sup id="1KI.1.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
So Bathsheba went to see the king in his bedroom. He was very old, and Abishag was taking care of him. <a href="#1KI.1.16"><sup id="1KI.1.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
Bathsheba bowed very low in front of the king, and the king asked her, “What do you want?”</p>
<p id="p-1KI.1.16" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.1.17"><sup id="1KI.1.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
She replied, “Your Majesty, you solemnly promised me, knowing that Yahweh our God <span id="add-1KI.1.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">was listening</span> [IDM], that my son Solomon would become king after you <span id="add-1KI.1.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">die</span>, and that he would sit on your throne <span id="add-1KI.1.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and rule</span>. <a href="#1KI.1.18"><sup id="1KI.1.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
But now, believe it or not, Adonijah has become king, and you do not know anything about it. <a href="#1KI.1.19"><sup id="1KI.1.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
He has sacrificed a lot of oxen and fattened cattle and sheep, and he has invited all of your other sons to the celebration. He has also invited Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of your army, but he did not invite your son Solomon. <a href="#1KI.1.20"><sup id="1KI.1.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
Your Majesty, all the people [SYN] of Israel are expecting you to tell them who is the one who will become king after you are no longer the king. <a href="#1KI.1.21"><sup id="1KI.1.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
If you do not do that, what will happen is that after you die [EUP] people will consider that my son Solomon and I are rebelling, <span id="add-1KI.1.21" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and they will execute us because we did not help Adonijah to become king</span>.”</p>
<p id="p-1KI.1.21" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.1.22"><sup id="1KI.1.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
While she was still talking to the king, Nathan came <span id="add-1KI.1.22" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to the palace</span>. <a href="#1KI.1.23"><sup id="1KI.1.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
The king’s servants/advisors told David, “Nathan the prophet has come.” So <span id="add-1KI.1.23" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Bathsheba left, and</span> Nathan went into where the king was and knelt down, with his face on the ground.</p>
<p id="p-1KI.1.23" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.1.24"><sup id="1KI.1.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
Then Nathan said, “Your Majesty, have you declared that Adonijah will become king after you are no longer the king? <a href="#1KI.1.25"><sup id="1KI.1.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
<span id="add-1KI.1.25" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">I say that </span> because today he has gone down <span id="add-1KI.1.25" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to En-Rogel Spring</span> and has sacrificed a lot of oxen, fattened cattle, and sheep. And he has invited all of your other sons, Joab the army commander, and Abiathar the priest. They are all eating and drinking with him and saying ‘We hope/desire that King Adonijah will live a long time!’ <a href="#1KI.1.26"><sup id="1KI.1.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
But he did not invite me or Zadok the priest or Benaiah or Solomon. <a href="#1KI.1.27"><sup id="1KI.1.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
Did you, as the king, say that they should do this without telling your other officials who you want to become king [MTY] after you are no longer the king?”</p>
<p id="s1-1KI.1.27" class="usx-s1" >David arranged for Solomon to be declared king</p>
<p id="p-1KI.1.27" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.1.28"><sup id="1KI.1.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
Then <span id="add-1KI.1.28" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">after Nathan left the room,</span> King David said <span id="add-1KI.1.28" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to one of his servants</span>, “Tell Bathsheba to come in here again.” So <span id="add-1KI.1.28" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">he went and told her, and</span> she came in and stood in front of the king.</p>
<p id="p-1KI.1.28" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.1.29-30"><sup id="1KI.1.29-30" class="usx-v">29-30</sup></a>
Then the king said, “Yahweh has rescued me from all my troubles. I promised you, with Yahweh the God whom we Israelis <span id="add-1KI.1.29-30" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">worship</span> listening, that your son Solomon would be king after I am no longer the king. Today, as surely as Yahweh lives, <span id="add-1KI.1.29-30" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">I solemnly declare that</span> I will do what I promised.” <a href="#1KI.1.31"><sup id="1KI.1.31" class="usx-v">31</sup></a>
Bathsheba knelt down with her face on the ground and said, “Your Majesty, I hope/desire that you will live for many more years [HYP]!”</p>
<p id="p-1KI.1.31" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.1.32"><sup id="1KI.1.32" class="usx-v">32</sup></a>
Then King David said, “Summon Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah.” <span id="add-1KI.1.32" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">So someone went and summoned them.</span> When they came in, <a href="#1KI.1.33"><sup id="1KI.1.33" class="usx-v">33</sup></a>
he said to them, “Put my son Solomon on my mule. Take him with my officials down to Gihon <span id="add-1KI.1.33" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Spring</span>. <a href="#1KI.1.34"><sup id="1KI.1.34" class="usx-v">34</sup></a>
There, you two, Zadok and Nathan, should anoint him, <span id="add-1KI.1.34" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">with olive oil to appoint him to be</span> the king of Israel. Then you must blow trumpets, and <span id="add-1KI.1.34" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">all the people there must</span> shout, ‘We hope/desire that King Solomon will live for many years!’ <a href="#1KI.1.35"><sup id="1KI.1.35" class="usx-v">35</sup></a>
Then follow him back here, and he will come and sit on my throne. He will then become king instead of me. I have appointed him to be the ruler of <span id="add-1KI.1.35" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">all the people of</span> Israel and of Judah.”</p>
<p id="p-1KI.1.35" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.1.36"><sup id="1KI.1.36" class="usx-v">36</sup></a>
Benaiah replied, “We will do that! We hope/wish that Yahweh, who is your God <span id="add-1KI.1.36" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and our God</span>, will cause it to happen! <a href="#1KI.1.37"><sup id="1KI.1.37" class="usx-v">37</sup></a>
King David, Yahweh has helped you; we hope/wish that he will also help Solomon and enable him to become a greater king than you have been.”</p>
<p id="p-1KI.1.37" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.1.38"><sup id="1KI.1.38" class="usx-v">38</sup></a>
So Zadok, Nathan, Benaiah, and the two groups of men who were the king’s bodyguards went and put Solomon on King David’s mule and escorted him down to Gihon <span id="add-1KI.1.38" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Spring</span>. <a href="#1KI.1.39"><sup id="1KI.1.39" class="usx-v">39</sup></a>
There Zadok took the container of <span id="add-1KI.1.39" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">olive</span> oil from the Sacred Tent and ◄anointed/poured some oil on► Solomon. Then the trumpets were blown, and all the people shouted, “We hope/wish that King Solomon will live for many years!” <a href="#1KI.1.40"><sup id="1KI.1.40" class="usx-v">40</sup></a>
Then all the people followed him back up <span id="add-1KI.1.40" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to the city</span>, shouting joyfully and playing flutes. They shouted very loudly, with the result that the ground shook.</p>
<p id="s1-1KI.1.40" class="usx-s1" >Adonijah’s reaction</p>
<p id="p-1KI.1.40" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.1.41"><sup id="1KI.1.41" class="usx-v">41</sup></a>
When Adonijah and all ◄his guests/the people whom he had invited► were finishing eating at their celebration, they heard the noise. When Joab heard the sound of the trumpets, he asked, “What is causing all that noise in the city?”</p>
<p id="p-1KI.1.41" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.1.42"><sup id="1KI.1.42" class="usx-v">42</sup></a>
While he was still speaking, Jonathan, the son of Abiathar the priest, arrived. Adonijah said, “Come in! You are a man whom we can trust, so you must be bringing us good news!”</p>
<p id="p-1KI.1.42" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.1.43"><sup id="1KI.1.43" class="usx-v">43</sup></a>
Jonathan replied, “No, <span id="add-1KI.1.43" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">I do not have good news</span>! His Majesty, King David, has caused Solomon to be the king! <a href="#1KI.1.44"><sup id="1KI.1.44" class="usx-v">44</sup></a>
He sent Zadok, Nathan, Benaiah, and his own group of bodyguards to go with Solomon. They put Solomon on King David’s mule. <a href="#1KI.1.45"><sup id="1KI.1.45" class="usx-v">45</sup></a>
They <span id="add-1KI.1.45" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">went down to</span> Gihon <span id="add-1KI.1.45" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Spring</span>, and there Zadok and Nathan anointed him to become the king. Now they have returned from there to the city, shouting joyfully. That is why there is that great/loud noise that you are hearing. <a href="#1KI.1.46"><sup id="1KI.1.46" class="usx-v">46</sup></a>
So Solomon is now our king [MTY]. <a href="#1KI.1.47"><sup id="1KI.1.47" class="usx-v">47</sup></a>
Furthermore, the palace officials came to His Majesty, King David, to tell him that they approved of what he had done. They said, ‘We wish/hope that our God will enable Solomon [MTY] to become more famous than you have been and enable him to be a better king than you have been.’ When they said that, the king, lying on his bed, bowed his head to worship <span id="add-1KI.1.47" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Yahweh</span>. <a href="#1KI.1.48"><sup id="1KI.1.48" class="usx-v">48</sup></a>
Then he said, ‘I praise Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis <span id="add-1KI.1.48" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">worship</span>, because he has allowed one of my sons to become the king today, and has permitted me to see it happen.’”</p>
<p id="p-1KI.1.48" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.1.49"><sup id="1KI.1.49" class="usx-v">49</sup></a>
Then all of Adonijah’s guests ◄trembled/were afraid►, so they all immediately got up and left and scattered. <a href="#1KI.1.50"><sup id="1KI.1.50" class="usx-v">50</sup></a>
Adonijah was afraid of what Solomon <span id="add-1KI.1.50" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">would do</span>, so he went <span id="add-1KI.1.50" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to the Sacred Tent</span> and grabbed the projections at the corners of the altar, <span id="add-1KI.1.50" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">because he knew that no one would kill him there</span>. <a href="#1KI.1.51"><sup id="1KI.1.51" class="usx-v">51</sup></a>
But someone told Solomon, “Hey/Listen, Adonijah is afraid of you, so he <span id="add-1KI.1.51" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">has gone to the Sacred Tent and </span> is holding on to the corners of the altar.

    <a href="#1KI.5.10"><sup id="1KI.5.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
So Hiram <span id="add-1KI.5.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">arranged for his workers to</span> supply all the cedar and cypress logs that Solomon wanted. <a href="#1KI.5.11"><sup id="1KI.5.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>

Yahweh enabled Solomon to be wise, just like he had promised. Solomon and Hiram made a treaty/agreement that there would be peace between their <span id="add-1KI.5.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">two governments/countries</span>.</p>

    <a href="#1KI.5.13"><sup id="1KI.5.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
King Solomon forced 30,000 men from all over Israel to become his workers. <a href="#1KI.5.14"><sup id="1KI.5.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
Adoniram was their boss. Solomon divided the men into three groups. Each month 10,000 of them went to Lebanon and worked for a month there, and then they came back home for two months. <a href="#1KI.5.15"><sup id="1KI.5.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
Solomon also forced 80,000 men to cut stones in the hilly area and 70,000 men to haul the stones <span id="add-1KI.5.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to Jerusalem</span>. <a href="#1KI.5.16"><sup id="1KI.5.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
And he also assigned 3,600 men to supervise their work. <a href="#1KI.5.17"><sup id="1KI.5.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
The king also commanded his workers to cut huge blocks of stones from the quarries and to smooth the sides of the stones. Those huge stones were for the foundation of the temple. <a href="#1KI.5.18"><sup id="1KI.5.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
Solomon’s workers and Hiram’s workers and men from Gebal/Byblos <span id="add-1KI.5.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">city</span> shaped the stones and prepared the timber to build the temple.</p>

480 years after the Israeli people left Egypt, during the fourth year that Solomon ruled Israel, early in May, Solomon’s workers began to build the temple.</p>
<p id="p-1KI.6.1" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.6.2"><sup id="1KI.6.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
Inside, <span id="add-1KI.6.2" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the main part of</span> the temple was 90 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 45 feet high. <a href="#1KI.6.3"><sup id="1KI.6.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
The entrance room was 15 feet long and 30 feet wide, just as wide as the main part of the temple. <a href="#1KI.6.4"><sup id="1KI.6.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
There were windows in <span id="add-1KI.6.4" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the walls of</span> the temple. The windows were narrower on the outside than on the inside. <a href="#1KI.6.5"><sup id="1KI.6.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
Against the two sides and against the back of the temple walls, they built a structure/building that had rooms in it. <span id="add-1KI.6.5" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">This structure had three levels/stories and each was 7-1/2 feet high</span>. <a href="#1KI.6.6"><sup id="1KI.6.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
<span id="add-1KI.6.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Each room in</span> the lowest level/story was 7-1/2 feet wide. <span id="add-1KI.6.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Each room in</span> the middle level/story was nine feet wide. <span id="add-1KI.6.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">The rooms in</span> the top level/story were 10-1/2 feet wide. The wall of the temple at the top level/story was thinner than the wall at the middle level/story, and the wall of the middle level/story was thinner than the wall at the bottom level/story. The result was that the rooms could be supported by the wall underneath them, and did not require wooden beams to support them.</p>
<p id="p-1KI.6.6" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.6.7"><sup id="1KI.6.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
The huge stones for <span id="add-1KI.6.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the foundation of</span> the temple were cut and shaped at the quarry <span id="add-1KI.6.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to become very smooth</span>. The result was that while the workers were building the temple there was no noise, because they did not use hammers or chisels or any other iron tools there.</p>
<p id="p-1KI.6.7" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.6.8"><sup id="1KI.6.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
The entrance to the bottom level/story <span id="add-1KI.6.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">of that attached structure</span> was on the south side of the temple. There were stairs from the bottom level/story to the middle and top level/story. <a href="#1KI.6.9"><sup id="1KI.6.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
So Solomon’s <span id="add-1KI.6.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">workers</span> finished building the <span id="add-1KI.6.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">framework of the</span> temple. They made the ceiling from cedar beams and boards. <a href="#1KI.6.10"><sup id="1KI.6.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
They built the structure that had three levels/stories, that was against the walls of the temple. Each level/story was 7-1/2 feet high, and was joined to the temple with cedar beams.</p>
<p id="p-1KI.6.10" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.6.11"><sup id="1KI.6.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>

Inside the back part of the temple they built an inner room, called the Very Holy Place. It was 30 feet long. All the walls of this room were lined with cedar boards. <a href="#1KI.6.17"><sup id="1KI.6.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>

The cedar <span id="add-1KI.6.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">boards on the walls</span> inside the temple were decorated with carvings of gourds and flowers. <span id="add-1KI.6.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">The walls were</span> completely covered with cedar boards, with the result that the stones <span id="add-1KI.6.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">of the walls behind them</span> could not be seen.</p>

    <a href="#1KI.6.19"><sup id="1KI.6.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
At the back of the temple they made the Very Holy Place, where the Sacred Chest would be put. <a href="#1KI.6.20"><sup id="1KI.6.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
That room was 30 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 30 feet high.

    <a href="#1KI.6.23"><sup id="1KI.6.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
Inside the Very Holy Place, they made from olive tree wood <span id="add-1KI.6.23" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">large statues of</span> two creatures with wings. Each one was 15 feet tall. <a href="#1KI.6.24-26"><sup id="1KI.6.24-26" class="usx-v">24-26</sup></a>

Solomon invited him to come <span id="add-1KI.7.13-14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to Jerusalem and supervise</span> all the work of making things from bronze, and Huram agreed.</p>

He made two bronze pillars. Each one was 27 feet tall and 18 feet around. Each was hollow, and the walls of the pillars were 3 in./7.4 cm. thick. <a href="#1KI.7.16"><sup id="1KI.7.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
He also made two bronze caps to be put on top of the pillars. Each cap was 7-1/2 feet tall. <a href="#1KI.7.17"><sup id="1KI.7.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
Then he made bronze wreaths of chains to decorate the top part of each pillar. <a href="#1KI.7.18"><sup id="1KI.7.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
He also made bronze <span id="add-1KI.7.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">figures that resembled</span> pomegranates. He put two rows of pomegranates over the top parts of each pillar. <a href="#1KI.7.19"><sup id="1KI.7.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
The top part over each pillar was shaped like a lily. Each <span id="add-1KI.7.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">lily leaf</span> was six feet tall. <a href="#1KI.7.20"><sup id="1KI.7.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
These top parts were placed on a bowl-shaped section around which was draped the wreaths of chains. He made 200 <span id="add-1KI.7.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">figures that represented</span> pomegranates and put them in two rows around the top/head of each pillar. <a href="#1KI.7.21"><sup id="1KI.7.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
His <span id="add-1KI.7.21" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">helpers</span> set up the pillars in front of the entrance of the temple. The pillar on the south side was named Jakin, and the pillar on the north side was named Boaz. <a href="#1KI.7.22"><sup id="1KI.7.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
The bronze top parts that were shaped like lilies were placed on top of the pillars.</p>

Huram also constructed a very large round bronze tank that was made of metal and cast <span id="add-1KI.7.23" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in a clay mold</span>. It was 7-1/2 ft./2.3 meters high, 30 feet/9 meters across/wide, and 45 feet/13.5 meters around it. <a href="#1KI.7.24"><sup id="1KI.7.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>

He placed them to face outward. He placed three of them to face north, three to face west, three to face south, and three to face east. His helpers put the bronze tank on the backs of <span id="add-1KI.7.25" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the statues of</span> the oxen. <a href="#1KI.7.26"><sup id="1KI.7.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
The sides <span id="add-1KI.7.26" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">of the tank</span> were 3 in./8 cm. thick. The rim was like the rim of a cup.

    <a href="#1KI.7.27"><sup id="1KI.7.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
Huram also made ten bronze carts. Each was six feet long and six feet wide and 4-1/2 feet tall. <a href="#1KI.7.28"><sup id="1KI.7.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
<span id="add-1KI.7.28" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">On the sides of the carts</span> there were panels which were set in frames. <a href="#1KI.7.29"><sup id="1KI.7.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>
On those panels were <span id="add-1KI.7.29" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">bronze figures of</span> lions, bulls, and winged creatures. Below and above the lions and bulls there were decorations of bronze wreaths. <a href="#1KI.7.30"><sup id="1KI.7.30" class="usx-v">30</sup></a>
Each cart had four bronze wheels and two axles made of bronze. At the top corners of each cart were bronze supports to hold up a basin. On these supports were also decorations of bronze wreaths. <a href="#1KI.7.31"><sup id="1KI.7.31" class="usx-v">31</sup></a>
On top of each cart, <span id="add-1KI.7.31" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">under each basin,</span> was a frame <span id="add-1KI.7.31" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that resembled</span> a circular collar. The top of each circular frame was 18 inches above the top of the cart, and the bottom of it was nine inches below the top of the cart. There were also decorations of bronze wreaths on the frame engraved within square panels. <a href="#1KI.7.32"><sup id="1KI.7.32" class="usx-v">32</sup></a>
The wheels were 27 inches high. They were below the panels. The wheels were connected to axles that had been cast in the same mold as the rest of the cart. <a href="#1KI.7.33"><sup id="1KI.7.33" class="usx-v">33</sup></a>
The wheels of the carts were like the wheels of chariots. The axles, the rims, the spokes, and the hubs were all cast <span id="add-1KI.7.33" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">from bronze</span>.</p>
<p id="p-1KI.7.33" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.7.34"><sup id="1KI.7.34" class="usx-v">34</sup></a>
At the top corners of each cart there were handles. These were cast in the same mold as the rest of the cart. <a href="#1KI.7.35"><sup id="1KI.7.35" class="usx-v">35</sup></a>
There was a nine-inch bronze band around the top of each cart. There were braces attached to the corners of each cart. The bands and the braces were cast in the same mold as the rest of the cart. <a href="#1KI.7.36"><sup id="1KI.7.36" class="usx-v">36</sup></a>
The braces and the panels <span id="add-1KI.7.36" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">on the sides of the carts</span> were also decorated with <span id="add-1KI.7.36" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">figures of</span> winged creatures, lions, and palm trees, whenever there was space for them, and there were bronze wreaths all around them. <a href="#1KI.7.37"><sup id="1KI.7.37" class="usx-v">37</sup></a>
That is how Huram made the ten carts. They <span id="add-1KI.7.37" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">were all cast in the same mold, so they</span> were all alike: They all were the same size and had the same shape.</p>

    <a href="#1KI.7.38"><sup id="1KI.7.38" class="usx-v">38</sup></a>
Huram also made ten bronze basins, one for each cart. Each basin was six feet across and held 200 gallons <span id="add-1KI.7.38" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">of water</span>. <a href="#1KI.7.39"><sup id="1KI.7.39" class="usx-v">39</sup></a>

He forced them to build the temple and his palace and the terraces/landfills <span id="add-1KI.9.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">on the east side of the city</span>, and the wall around Jerusalem, and <span id="add-1KI.9.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to rebuild the cities of</span> Hazor and Megiddo and Gezer. <a href="#1KI.9.16"><sup id="1KI.9.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
<span id="add-1KI.9.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">The reason they needed to rebuild Gezer was that the army of</span> the king of Egypt had attacked Gezer and captured it. Then they had burned <span id="add-1KI.9.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the houses in</span> the city and killed all the people of the Canaan people-group who lived there. The king of Egypt gave that city to his daughter as a gift when she married Solomon. <a href="#1KI.9.17"><sup id="1KI.9.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
So Solomon’s workers also rebuilt Gezer, and they also rebuilt Lower Beth-Horon <span id="add-1KI.9.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">city</span>. <a href="#1KI.9.18"><sup id="1KI.9.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>

They also built cities where they kept the supplies for Solomon, the places where his horses and chariots were kept. They also built everything else that Solomon wanted them to build, in Jerusalem and in Lebanon, and in other places in the area over which he ruled.</p>

    <a href="#1KI.9.20"><sup id="1KI.9.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
There were many people who belonged to the Amor people-group, the Heth people-group, the Periz people-group, the Hiv people-group, and the Jebus people-group who were not killed when the Israelis captured their land. <a href="#1KI.9.21"><sup id="1KI.9.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
<span id="add-1KI.9.21" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Their descendants still lived in Israel</span>.

But Solomon did not force any Israeli people to become slaves. Some Israelis became soldiers and army officers and commanders and drivers of his chariots and soldiers who rode on horses. <a href="#1KI.9.23"><sup id="1KI.9.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
There were 550 officials who supervised the slaves who worked <span id="add-1KI.9.23" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to build all those places</span>.</p>

She came with a large group of wealthy/influential people, and she brought camels that were loaded with spices, and valuable gems, and a lot of gold. When she met Solomon, she asked him questions about all the topics/things in which she was interested. <a href="#1KI.10.3"><sup id="1KI.10.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
Solomon answered all her questions. He explained everything that she asked about, even things that were very difficult. <a href="#1KI.10.4"><sup id="1KI.10.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
The queen realized that Solomon was very wise. She saw his palace; <a href="#1KI.10.5"><sup id="1KI.10.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
she saw the food that was served on his table <span id="add-1KI.10.5" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">every day</span>; she saw where his officials lived (OR, how his officials were seated at the table), their uniforms, the servants who served the food and wine, and the sacrifices that he took to the temple to be offered.

Then the queen gave to the king <span id="add-1KI.10.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the things that she had brought.

King Solomon told his workers to use that wood to make railings/supports in the temple of Yahweh and in the king’s palace and also to make harps and lyres for the ◄musicians/men who played musical instruments►. That wood was the largest amount of (OR, the finest) wood that had ever been seen <span id="add-1KI.10.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in Israel</span>.

King Solomon’s workers <span id="add-1KI.10.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">took this</span> gold and hammered it into thin sheets and covered 200 large shields with those thin sheets of gold; they put ◄almost 15 pounds/more than 6 kg.► of gold on each shield. <a href="#1KI.10.17"><sup id="1KI.10.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
His workers made 300 smaller shields. They covered each of them with ◄almost 4 pounds/1.5 kg.► of gold. Then the king put those shields in the Hall of the Forest of Lebanon.</p>

There were six steps in front of the throne. There was a statue of a lion on both sides of each step. So altogether there were twelve statues of lions. The back of the throne was rounded at the top. At each side of the throne there was an armrest, and alongside each armrest there was a small statue of a lion. No throne like that had ever existed in any other kingdom. <a href="#1KI.10.21"><sup id="1KI.10.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
All of Solomon’s cups were made of gold, and all the various dishes in the Hall of the Forest of Lebanon were made of gold.

All the people who came to him brought presents: They brought things made from silver or gold, or robes, or weapons (OR, myrrh), or spices, or horses, or mules. The people continued to do this every year.</p>

    <a href="#1KI.10.26"><sup id="1KI.10.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
Solomon acquired 1,400 chariots and 12,000 men who rode <span id="add-1KI.10.26" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">on the horses</span> (OR, <span id="add-1KI.10.26" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in the chariots</span>).

Some other men joined them there. Then they all traveled to Egypt and went to see the king of Egypt. The king gave Hadad some land and ordered his servants to give him some food regularly. <a href="#1KI.11.19"><sup id="1KI.11.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
The king liked Hadad. As a result he gave him the sister of his own wife, Queen Tahpenes, to be Hadad’s wife.</p>
<p id="p-1KI.11.19" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.11.20"><sup id="1KI.11.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
Later Hadad’s wife gave birth to a son named Genubath. The sister of Tahpenes ◄raised him/brought him up► in the palace, where he lived with the king’s sons.</p>

    <a href="#1KI.11.21"><sup id="1KI.11.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
While Hadad was in Egypt, he heard that David had died [EUP], and that Joab, the commander of David’s army, was also dead. So he said to the king of Egypt, “Please allow me to return to my own country.”</p>
<p id="p-1KI.11.21" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.11.22"><sup id="1KI.11.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
But the king said to him, “Why do you want to go back to your country? Is there something that you lack that you want me to give to you?” Hadad replied, “No, but please just allow me to go.” <span id="add-1KI.11.22" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">So the king allowed him to leave, and he returned to his own country and became the king of Edom</span>.</p>

    <a href="#1KI.11.23"><sup id="1KI.11.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
God also caused another man named Rezon, the son of Eliada, to rebel against Solomon. Rezon had run away from his master, King Hadadezer of <span id="add-1KI.11.23" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the</span> Zobah <span id="add-1KI.11.23" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">area north of Damascus</span>. <a href="#1KI.11.24"><sup id="1KI.11.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
Rezon then became the leader of a group of outlaws. That happened after David’s <span id="add-1KI.11.24" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">army had defeated Hadadezer and</span> had <span id="add-1KI.11.24" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">also</span> killed all <span id="add-1KI.11.24" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">his soldiers</span>.

All during the time that Solomon was alive, while Rezon was ruling <span id="add-1KI.11.25" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">not only Damascus but all of</span> Syria, he was an enemy of Israel and caused trouble for Israel like Hadad did.</p>

Another man who rebelled against [IDM] Solomon was one of his officials named Jeroboam, the son of Nebat.

Jeroboam was a very capable young man. So, when Solomon saw that he worked very hard, he appointed him to supervise all the men who were forced to work in the areas where the tribes of Manasseh and Ephraim live.</p>

    <a href="#1KI.11.29"><sup id="1KI.11.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>

I am going to do this because Solomon has rejected me and has been worshiping Astarte, the goddess that the people of Sidon worship, Chemosh, the god that the Moab people-group worship, and Milcom, the god that the Ammon people-group worship.

When King Jeroboam heard the prophet say that, he pointed his finger at him and said to his servants, “Seize that man!” But immediately the king’s arm became paralyzed/stiff, with the result that he could not move it. <a href="#1KI.13.5"><sup id="1KI.13.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>

He went along the road to ◄find/catch up with► the prophet from Judah. He found him sitting under an oak tree. He said to him, “Are you the prophet who came from Judah?” He replied, “Yes, I am.”</p>

While they were sitting at the table, Yahweh spoke to the old man. <a href="#1KI.13.21"><sup id="1KI.13.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
Then he cried out to the prophet from Judah, “This is what Yahweh says: ‘You have disobeyed him, and you have not done what he commanded you to do. <a href="#1KI.13.22"><sup id="1KI.13.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>

He made plans to kill Elah while Elah was in Tirzah, getting drunk at the house of <span id="add-1KI.16.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">a man named</span> Arza. Arza was the man who took care of the things in the king’s palace. <a href="#1KI.16.10"><sup id="1KI.16.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
Zimri went into Arza’s house and killed Elah. Then Zimri became the king of Israel. That was when Asa had been the king of Judah for 27 years.</p>
<p id="p-1KI.16.10" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.16.11"><sup id="1KI.16.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
As soon as Zimri became king [MTY], he killed all of Baasha’s family [MTY]. That included every male [IDM] in Baasha’s family and all of Baasha’s male friends. <a href="#1KI.16.12"><sup id="1KI.16.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
That was just what Yahweh told the prophet Jehu would happen. <a href="#1KI.16.13"><sup id="1KI.16.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Baasha and his son Elah had sinned and led the Israeli people to sin. They caused Yahweh, the God whom the Israeli people worshiped, to become angry, because they both urged the people <span id="add-1KI.16.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to worship</span> worthless idols.</p>

So Zimri became the king of Israel after Asa had been king of Judah for 27 years. But Zimri ruled in Tirzah for only seven days. The Israeli army was beseiging/surrounding Gibeah, a town which belonged to the Philistine people-group. <a href="#1KI.16.16"><sup id="1KI.16.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
The men in the Israeli army camp heard that Zimri had secretly planned to kill King Elah, and then had killed him. So on that day the soldiers chose Omri, the commander of their army, to become the king of Israel. <a href="#1KI.16.17"><sup id="1KI.16.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
The Israeli army was camped near Gibbethon <span id="add-1KI.16.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">city</span>. When they heard what Zimri had done, they left there and went to Tirzah, and surrounded the city. <a href="#1KI.16.18"><sup id="1KI.16.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
When Zimri realized that the city was <span id="add-1KI.16.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">about to be</span> captured, he went into his palace and set it on fire. So the palace burned down, and he died <span id="add-1KI.16.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in the fire</span>. <a href="#1KI.16.19"><sup id="1KI.16.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
He died because he had sinned by doing the things that Yahweh considered to be evil. Jeroboam had led the Israeli people to sin, and Zimri sinned just like Jeroboam had sinned.</p>

After Zimri died, the Israeli people were divided. One group wanted Tibni, the son of Ginath, to be their king.

He committed the same kind of sins that Jeroboam did, but he did things that were worse than the things that Jeroboam did.

Obadiah objected. He said, “Sir, I have not [RHQ] harmed you at all. So why are you sending me back to Ahab? He will kill me! <a href="#1KI.18.10"><sup id="1KI.18.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
Yahweh your God <span id="add-1KI.18.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">knows that I am telling the truth when</span> I solemnly declare that King Ahab has searched in every kingdom all over the world [HYP] to find you. Each time that some king said to him, ‘Elijah is not here,’ Ahab demanded that the king of that country solemnly swear/declare that the king was telling the truth. <a href="#1KI.18.11"><sup id="1KI.18.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
Now you say to me, ‘Go and tell your master that Elijah is here!’ <a href="#1KI.18.12"><sup id="1KI.18.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
But as soon as I leave you, the Spirit of Yahweh will carry you away, and I will not know where he will take you.

My master, have you not heard about what I did when Jezebel wanted to kill all of Yahweh’s prophets? I hid 100 of them in two caves and took food and water to them. <a href="#1KI.18.14"><sup id="1KI.18.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
Now, sir, you say, ‘Go and tell your master that Elijah is here.’ But if I do that, <span id="add-1KI.18.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and he comes and you are not here,</span> he will kill me!”</p>

    <a href="#1KI.18.15"><sup id="1KI.18.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
But Elijah replied, “Yahweh, the Almighty One whom I serve [IDM], knows that <span id="add-1KI.18.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">I am telling the truth as</span> I solemnly declare that I will go to meet with Ahab today.”</p>

So Obadiah went to tell Ahab that Elijah had come. Ahab went to meet with him. <a href="#1KI.18.17"><sup id="1KI.18.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
When he saw Elijah, he said to him, “Is that you, the one who causes trouble for <span id="add-1KI.18.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the people of</span> Israel?”</p>

    <a href="#1KI.18.18"><sup id="1KI.18.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
Elijah replied, “It is not I who have caused trouble for the people of Israel! You and your family are the ones who have caused trouble! You have refused to obey Yahweh’s commands, and you have worshiped the idols of Baal instead. <a href="#1KI.18.19"><sup id="1KI.18.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
So now, command all the Israeli people to come to Carmel Mountain, and <span id="add-1KI.18.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">be sure to</span> bring all the 450 prophets who worship Baal and the 400 prophets who worship <span id="add-1KI.18.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the goddess</span> Asherah, the ones to whom <span id="add-1KI.18.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">your wife</span> Jezebel brings food and water.”</p>

    <a href="#1KI.18.20"><sup id="1KI.18.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
So Ahab summoned all his prophets and all the other <span id="add-1KI.18.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Israeli</span> people to the top of Carmel Mountain, <span id="add-1KI.18.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and Elijah went up there too.</span> <a href="#1KI.18.21"><sup id="1KI.18.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
Then Elijah stood in front of them and said, “How long [RHQ] are you going to be undecided <span id="add-1KI.18.21" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">about who is truly God</span>? If Yahweh is <span id="add-1KI.18.21" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">truly</span> God, then worship/serve him. If Baal is truly God, then worship/serve him!” But the people said nothing <span id="add-1KI.18.21" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in reply, because they were afraid of what Jezebel would do to them if they admitted that they worshiped Yahweh</span>.</p>

    <a href="#1KI.18.22"><sup id="1KI.18.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
Then Elijah said to them, “I am the only true prophet of Yahweh who is left, but Baal has 450 prophets. <a href="#1KI.18.23"><sup id="1KI.18.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
Bring two bulls. The prophets of Baal may choose the one that they want. They must <span id="add-1KI.18.23" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">kill it and</span> cut it into pieces and lay the pieces on the wood that is on the altar that they have made. But they must not light a fire <span id="add-1KI.18.23" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">under the wood</span>. <span id="add-1KI.18.23" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">I will kill the other bull and cut it in pieces and lay the pieces on the altar that I make</span>. <a href="#1KI.18.24"><sup id="1KI.18.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
Then they must call to their god [MTY], and I will call to Yahweh. The god who answers by lighting a fire <span id="add-1KI.18.24" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to the wood that is on that altar</span> is <span id="add-1KI.18.24" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the true</span> God!”</p>
<p id="p-1KI.18.24" class="usx-p" >Then all the people thought that Elijah’s suggestion was good.</p>
<p id="p-1KI.18.24" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.18.25"><sup id="1KI.18.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “You call to Baal first, because there are many of you. Choose one of the bulls and prepare it, and then call to your god. But do not light a fire under the wood!” <a href="#1KI.18.26"><sup id="1KI.18.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
So they killed one of the bulls and cut it up and placed the pieces on the altar. Then they called out to Baal all morning. They shouted, “Baal, answer us!” But no one answered. There was no reply at all [DOU].</p>
<p id="p-1KI.18.26" class="usx-p" >Then they danced wildly around the altar that they had made.</p>

    <a href="#1KI.18.27"><sup id="1KI.18.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
About noontime, Elijah started to make fun of them. He said, “<span id="add-1KI.18.27" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Surely</span> Baal is a god, so it seems that you must shout louder! Perhaps he is thinking about something, or perhaps he has gone to the toilet. Or perhaps he is traveling somewhere, or perhaps he is asleep and you need to wake him up!” <a href="#1KI.18.28"><sup id="1KI.18.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
So they shouted louder. Then, doing one of the things that they frequently did <span id="add-1KI.18.28" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">when they worshiped Baal</span>, they slashed/cut themselves with knives and swords until a lot of blood flowed. <a href="#1KI.18.29"><sup id="1KI.18.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>
They continued calling out to Baal all afternoon. But there was no reply, no answer, no god who paid attention.</p>
<p id="p-1KI.18.29" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.18.30"><sup id="1KI.18.30" class="usx-v">30</sup></a>
Then Elijah called to the people saying, “Come closer!” So they all crowded around him. Then Elijah repaired the altar of Yahweh that had previously been ◄ruined/torn down► <span id="add-1KI.18.30" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">by the prophets of Baal</span>. <a href="#1KI.18.31"><sup id="1KI.18.31" class="usx-v">31</sup></a>
Then he took twelve <span id="add-1KI.18.31" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">large</span> stones, each one to represent one of the Israeli tribes. The names of those tribes were given to them by their ancestor Jacob. <a href="#1KI.18.32"><sup id="1KI.18.32" class="usx-v">32</sup></a>
With these stones he rebuilt Yahweh’s altar. Then around the altar he dug a little ditch that was large enough to hold about ◄three gallons/12 liters► of water. <a href="#1KI.18.33"><sup id="1KI.18.33" class="usx-v">33</sup></a>
He piled wood on top of the stones. He killed the bull and cut it in pieces. Then he laid the pieces on top of the wood. Then he said, “Fill four large jars with water, and pour the water on top of the pieces of meat and the wood.” So they did that.</p>
<p id="p-1KI.18.33" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.18.34"><sup id="1KI.18.34" class="usx-v">34</sup></a>
Then he said, “Do the same thing again!” So they did it again. Then he said “Do it a third time!” So they did it again.</p>
<p id="p-1KI.18.34" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.18.35"><sup id="1KI.18.35" class="usx-v">35</sup></a>
As a result, the water flowed down below the altar and filled the ditches.</p>

    <a href="#1KI.18.36"><sup id="1KI.18.36" class="usx-v">36</sup></a>
When it was time to offer the evening sacrifices, Elijah walked close <span id="add-1KI.18.36" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to the altar</span> and prayed. He said, “Yahweh, you who are the God that <span id="add-1KI.18.36" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">our ancestors</span> Abraham and Isaac and Jacob <span id="add-1KI.18.36" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">worshiped</span>, prove today that you are the God whom the Israeli people <span id="add-1KI.18.36" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">should worship</span>, and prove that I am your servant. Prove that I have done all these things because you told me to do them. <a href="#1KI.18.37"><sup id="1KI.18.37" class="usx-v">37</sup></a>
Yahweh, answer me! Answer me in order that these people will know that you, Yahweh God, <span id="add-1KI.18.37" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">have the power to do what you say that you will do</span>, and that you have caused them to trust in [IDM] you again!”</p>
<p id="p-1KI.18.37" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.18.38"><sup id="1KI.18.38" class="usx-v">38</sup></a>
Immediately a fire from Yahweh flashed down from the sky. The fire burned up the pieces of meat, the wood, the stones, and the dirt <span id="add-1KI.18.38" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that was around the altar</span>. It even dried up all the water in the ditch!</p>
<p id="p-1KI.18.38" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.18.39"><sup id="1KI.18.39" class="usx-v">39</sup></a>
When the people saw that, they prostrated themselves on the ground and shouted, “Yahweh is God! Yahweh is God!”</p>

    <a href="#1KI.18.40"><sup id="1KI.18.40" class="usx-v">40</sup></a>
Then Elijah commanded them, “Seize all the prophets of Baal! Do not allow any of them to escape!” So the people seized all the prophets of Baal, and took them down the mountain to the Kishon Valley, and Elijah killed them all there.</p>
<p id="s1-1KI.18.40" class="usx-s1" >Elijah prayed for rain</p>

    <a href="#1KI.18.41"><sup id="1KI.18.41" class="usx-v">41</sup></a>
Then Elijah said to Ahab, “Go and get something to eat and drink. <span id="add-1KI.18.41" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">But do it quickly, because</span> it is soon going to rain very hard!” <a href="#1KI.18.42"><sup id="1KI.18.42" class="usx-v">42</sup></a>
So Ahab <span id="add-1KI.18.42" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and his men</span> left to prepare a big meal. But Elijah went back up to the top of Carmel Mountain and prayed.</p>

    <a href="#1KI.18.43"><sup id="1KI.18.43" class="usx-v">43</sup></a>
Then he said to his servant, “Go and look out toward the sea, <span id="add-1KI.18.43" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to see if there are any rain clouds.</span>” So his servant went and looked, <span id="add-1KI.18.43" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and came back</span> and said, “I do not see anything.” This happened six times. <a href="#1KI.18.44"><sup id="1KI.18.44" class="usx-v">44</sup></a>
But when the servant went the seventh time, he came back and said, “I saw a very small cloud above the sea. <span id="add-1KI.18.44" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">As I extend my arm,</span> the cloud is about the size of my hand/fist.”</p>
<p id="p-1KI.18.44" class="usx-p" >Then Elijah shouted to him, “Go and tell King Ahab to get his chariot ready and go home immediately! If he does not do that, the rain will stop him!” <a href="#1KI.18.45"><sup id="1KI.18.45" class="usx-v">45</sup></a>
Very soon the sky was full of black clouds. There was a strong wind, and then it began to rain very hard. Ahab got into his chariot and started to return to Jezreel <span id="add-1KI.18.45" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">city</span>. <a href="#1KI.18.46"><sup id="1KI.18.46" class="usx-v">46</sup></a>
Yahweh gave extra strength to Elijah.

When Ahab got home, he told <span id="add-1KI.19.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">his wife</span> Jezebel what Elijah had done. He told her that Elijah had killed all the prophets of Baal. <a href="#1KI.19.2"><sup id="1KI.19.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
So Jezebel sent this message to Elijah: “By this time tomorrow I will have <span id="add-1KI.19.2" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">killed</span> you, just like you <span id="add-1KI.19.2" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">killed all those prophets of Baal</span>.

He left his servant there. <a href="#1KI.19.4"><sup id="1KI.19.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
Then he went by himself further <span id="add-1KI.19.4" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">south</span> into the desert. He walked all day. He sat down under a broom tree and prayed that <span id="add-1KI.19.4" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Yahweh</span> would allow him to die.

And the prophet said to him, “This is what Yahweh says: ‘You have allowed that man <span id="add-1KI.20.42" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Ben-Hadad</span> to escape after I commanded you to be sure to execute him!

King Ahab had a palace in Jezreel <span id="add-1KI.21.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">city</span>. Near the palace was a vineyard owned by a man from that city whose name was Naboth. <a href="#1KI.21.2"><sup id="1KI.21.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
One day, Ahab <span id="add-1KI.21.2" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">went to</span> Naboth and said to him, “Your vineyard is close to my palace.

    <a href="#1KI.21.3"><sup id="1KI.21.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
But Naboth replied, “That land belonged to my ancestors, <span id="add-1KI.21.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">so I want to keep it</span>. I hope that Yahweh will never allow me to give that land to you!”</p>

    <a href="#1KI.21.4"><sup id="1KI.21.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
So Ahab became very sullen and angry because of what Naboth had said. He went home and lay down on his bed. He turned his face toward the wall, and he refused to eat anything.</p>
<p id="p-1KI.21.4" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.21.5"><sup id="1KI.21.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
His wife Jezebel came in and asked him, “Why are you so depressed? Why are you refusing to eat anything?”</p>

Ahab replied, “I talked to Naboth, that man from Jezreel.

    <a href="#1KI.21.8"><sup id="1KI.21.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
Then Jezebel wrote some letters, and she signed Ahab’s name on them. She used his official seal to seal them. Then she sent them to the older leaders and other important men who lived in Naboth’s town. <a href="#1KI.21.9"><sup id="1KI.21.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
This is what she wrote in the letters: “Proclaim a day when all the people will <span id="add-1KI.21.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">gather together and</span> ◄fast/abstain from eating food►.

Then find two men who always cause trouble. Give them places to sit opposite/facing him. Tell these men to testify that they heard Naboth say things that criticized God and the king. Then take Naboth out of the city and kill him by throwing stones at him.”</p>

    <a href="#1KI.21.11"><sup id="1KI.21.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
The leaders <span id="add-1KI.21.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">received the letters and</span> did what Jezebel had written in the letters for them to do. <a href="#1KI.21.12"><sup id="1KI.21.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
They declared a day on which the people would all ◄fast/abstain from food►. And they gave Naboth a seat in a place where honored people sat, in front of the people. <a href="#1KI.21.13"><sup id="1KI.21.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Two men who always caused trouble sat opposite/facing Naboth. While everyone was listening, they stated that they had heard Naboth say things that criticized God and the king. So the people seized Naboth. They took him outside the city and killed him <span id="add-1KI.21.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">by throwing</span> stones at him. <a href="#1KI.21.14"><sup id="1KI.21.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
Then those leaders sent a message to Jezebel, saying “We have executed Naboth.”</p>

    <a href="#1KI.21.15"><sup id="1KI.21.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
When Jezebel found out that Naboth had been killed, she told Ahab, “Naboth is dead. Now you can go and take possession of the vineyard that he refused to sell to you.” <a href="#1KI.21.16"><sup id="1KI.21.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he got up and went to the vineyard to claim that he now owned it.</p>

    <a href="#1KI.21.17"><sup id="1KI.21.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
Then Yahweh spoke to Elijah the prophet. He said, <a href="#1KI.21.18"><sup id="1KI.21.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
“Go to Samaria and talk to Ahab, the king of Israel. He is in the vineyard of a man named Naboth. He has gone there to claim that he now owns it. <a href="#1KI.21.19"><sup id="1KI.21.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
Tell Ahab that this is what I, Yahweh, say to him: ‘You have murdered Naboth and taken his land.’ So I am telling you this: ‘In the same place where <span id="add-1KI.21.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Naboth died and</span> dogs came and licked up Naboth’s blood, <span id="add-1KI.21.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">you will die and</span> the dogs will lick up your blood, too!’&#160;”</p>

    <a href="#1KI.21.20"><sup id="1KI.21.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
So when Elijah met with Ahab, Ahab said to him, “You, my enemy, have found me!” [RHQ] Elijah answered, “Yes, I have found you. You have never stopped doing the things that Yahweh says are wrong.</p>
<p id="p-1KI.21.20" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.21.21"><sup id="1KI.21.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
So this is what Yahweh says to you: ‘I will soon get rid of you. I will kill you, and I will also kill every male in your household, including those who are slaves and those who are not slaves. <a href="#1KI.21.22"><sup id="1KI.21.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
Your family will all be killed, just like the family of King Jeroboam and like the family of King Baasha were killed. I will get rid of you because you have caused me to become very angry, and you have also led the Israeli people to sin.’</p>

    <a href="#1KI.21.23"><sup id="1KI.21.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>

<p id="p-1KI.21.24" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.21.25"><sup id="1KI.21.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
There was no man no man like Ahab who always did things that Yahweh considered to be evil. His wife Jezebel incited/urged him to do <span id="add-1KI.21.25" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">many of</span> those things. <a href="#1KI.21.26"><sup id="1KI.21.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
The most abominable/detestable thing that Ahab did was to worship idols, just like the Amor people-group had done. And that is why Yahweh took the Amor people’s land from them and gave it to the Israelis.</p>

    <a href="#1KI.21.27"><sup id="1KI.21.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
After Elijah finished talking to Ahab, Ahab tore his clothes <span id="add-1KI.21.27" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to show that he was sorry for all the sins that he had committed</span>. He put on rough clothes that were made from sacks, and he refused to eat anything. He even wore those rough clothes made from sacks when he slept, to show that he was sorry.</p>

    <a href="#1KI.21.28"><sup id="1KI.21.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
Then Yahweh said this to Elijah: <a href="#1KI.21.29"><sup id="1KI.21.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>
“I have seen [RHQ] that Ahab is now very sorry for all the evil things that he has done.

Finally one <span id="add-1KI.22.21" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">evil</span> spirit came to Yahweh and said, ‘I can do it!’</p>
<p id="p-1KI.22.21" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.22.22"><sup id="1KI.22.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
Yahweh asked him, ‘How will you do it?’</p>
<p id="p-1KI.22.22" class="usx-p" >The spirit replied, ‘I will go and inspire all of Ahab’s prophets to tell lies.’ Yahweh said, ‘You will be successful; go and do it!’ <a href="#1KI.22.23"><sup id="1KI.22.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
So now <span id="add-1KI.22.23" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">I tell you that</span> Yahweh has caused all of your prophets to lie to you. Yahweh has decided that something terrible will happen to you.”</p>

    <a href="#1KI.22.24"><sup id="1KI.22.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
Then Zedekiah walked over to Micaiah and slapped him on his face. He said, “Do you think that Yahweh’s Spirit left me in order to speak to you?” [RHQ]</p>
<p id="p-1KI.22.24" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.22.25"><sup id="1KI.22.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
Micaiah replied, “You will find out for yourself <span id="add-1KI.22.25" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">which of us Yahweh’s Spirit has truly spoken to</span> on the day when you go into a room of some house to hide <span id="add-1KI.22.25" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">from the Syrian troops</span>!”</p>
<p id="p-1KI.22.25" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.22.26"><sup id="1KI.22.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
King Ahab commanded <span id="add-1KI.22.26" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">his soldiers</span>, “Seize Micaiah and take him to Amon, the governor of this city, and to my son Joash. <a href="#1KI.22.27"><sup id="1KI.22.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
Tell them that I have commanded that they should put this man in prison and give him only bread and water. Do not give him anything else to eat until I return safely from the battle!”</p>
<p id="p-1KI.22.27" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.22.28"><sup id="1KI.22.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
Micaiah replied, “If you return safely, <span id="add-1KI.22.28" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">it will be clear that</span> it was not Yahweh who told me what to say to you!” Then he said <span id="add-1KI.22.28" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to all those who were standing there</span>, “Do not forget what I have said <span id="add-1KI.22.28" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to King Ahab</span>!”</p>
<p id="s1-1KI.22.28" class="usx-s1" >Ahab died in the battle</p>
<p id="p-1KI.22.28" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.22.29"><sup id="1KI.22.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>
So the King of Israel and the King of Judah <span id="add-1KI.22.29" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">led their armies</span> to Ramoth, in <span id="add-1KI.22.29" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the</span> Gilead <span id="add-1KI.22.29" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">region</span>. <a href="#1KI.22.30"><sup id="1KI.22.30" class="usx-v">30</sup></a>
King Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “I will put on different clothes, <span id="add-1KI.22.30" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in order that no one will recognize that I am the king</span>. But you should wear your ◄royal robe/robe that shows that you are a king►.” So Ahab disguised himself, and they both went into the battle.</p>
<p id="p-1KI.22.30" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.22.31"><sup id="1KI.22.31" class="usx-v">31</sup></a>
The King of Syria told this to his thirty-two men who were driving the chariots: “Attack only the king of Israel!” <a href="#1KI.22.32"><sup id="1KI.22.32" class="usx-v">32</sup></a>
So when the men who were driving the Syrian chariots saw Jehoshaphat <span id="add-1KI.22.32" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">wearing ◄his royal robes/clothes that showed he was the king►</span>, they pursued him. They shouted, “There is the king of Israel!” But when Jehoshaphat cried out, <a href="#1KI.22.33"><sup id="1KI.22.33" class="usx-v">33</sup></a>
they realized that he was not the king of Israel. So they stopped pursuing him.</p>
<p id="p-1KI.22.33" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.22.34"><sup id="1KI.22.34" class="usx-v">34</sup></a>
But one <span id="add-1KI.22.34" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Syrian</span> soldier shot an arrow at Ahab, without knowing that it was Ahab. The arrow struck Ahab between the places where the parts of his armor joined together. Ahab told the driver of his chariot, “Turn the chariot around and take me out of here! I have been severely wounded!” <a href="#1KI.22.35"><sup id="1KI.22.35" class="usx-v">35</sup></a>
The battle continued all the day. Ahab was sitting propped up in his chariot, facing the Syrian troops. The blood from his wound ran down to the floor of the chariot. And late in the afternoon he died. <a href="#1KI.22.36"><sup id="1KI.22.36" class="usx-v">36</sup></a>
Just as the sun was going down, someone among the Israeli troops shouted, “<span id="add-1KI.22.36" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">The battle is ended!</span> Everyone should return home!”</p>
<p id="p-1KI.22.36" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.22.37"><sup id="1KI.22.37" class="usx-v">37</sup></a>
So king Ahab died, and they took his body <span id="add-1KI.22.37" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in the chariot</span> to Samaria <span id="add-1KI.22.37" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">city</span> and buried his body there. <a href="#1KI.22.38"><sup id="1KI.22.38" class="usx-v">38</sup></a>
They washed his chariot alongside the pool in Samaria, a pool where the prostitutes bathed. And dogs <span id="add-1KI.22.38" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">came and</span> licked the king’s blood, just like Yahweh had predicted would happen.</p>
<p id="p-1KI.22.38" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.22.39"><sup id="1KI.22.39" class="usx-v">39</sup></a>
The account/record of the other things that happened while Ahab was ruling, and about the palace decorated with much ivory <span id="add-1KI.22.39" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that they built for him</span>, and the cities that were built for him, was written in the scroll called ‘The History of the Kings of Israel’. <a href="#1KI.22.40"><sup id="1KI.22.40" class="usx-v">40</sup></a>
When Ahab died, his body was buried where his ancestors were buried. Then his son Ahaziah became king.</p>
<p id="s1-1KI.22.40" class="usx-s1" >Jehoshaphat ruled in Judah</p>
<p id="p-1KI.22.40" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.22.41"><sup id="1KI.22.41" class="usx-v">41</sup></a>
Before King Ahab died, when he had been ruling in Israel for four years, Asa’s son Jehoshaphat started to rule in Judah. <a href="#1KI.22.42"><sup id="1KI.22.42" class="usx-v">42</sup></a>
Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he started to rule, and he ruled in Jerusalem for twenty-five years. His mother was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi. <a href="#1KI.22.43"><sup id="1KI.22.43" class="usx-v">43</sup></a>
Jehoshaphat was a good king, just like his father Asa had been. He did things that pleased Yahweh. But while he was king, he did not remove all the pagan altars <span id="add-1KI.22.43" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that the people had built</span> on the hilltops. So the people continued to offer sacrifices <span id="add-1KI.22.43" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to idols</span> on those altars and burned incense there. <a href="#1KI.22.44"><sup id="1KI.22.44" class="usx-v">44</sup></a>
Jehoshaphat also made <span id="add-1KI.22.44" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">a</span> peace <span id="add-1KI.22.44" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">agreement</span> with the king of Israel.</p>
<p id="p-1KI.22.44" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.22.45"><sup id="1KI.22.45" class="usx-v">45</sup></a>
All the other things that happened while Jehoshaphat was ruling, and the great things that he did and the victories his <span id="add-1KI.22.45" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">troops</span> won, are written in the scroll called ‘The History of the Kings of Judah’. <a href="#1KI.22.46"><sup id="1KI.22.46" class="usx-v">46</sup></a>
Jehoshaphat’s father Asa <span id="add-1KI.22.46" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">had tried to expel</span> the male prostitutes that stayed at the pagan shrines, but some of them were still there. Jehoshaphat got rid of them.</p>
<p id="p-1KI.22.46" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.22.47"><sup id="1KI.22.47" class="usx-v">47</sup></a>
At that time, there was no king in Edom; a ruler who had been appointed by Jehoshaphat ruled there.</p>
<p id="p-1KI.22.47" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.22.48"><sup id="1KI.22.48" class="usx-v">48</sup></a>
Jehoshaphat <span id="add-1KI.22.48" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">ordered some Israeli men to</span> build a fleet/group of ships to sail <span id="add-1KI.22.48" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">south</span> to <span id="add-1KI.22.48" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the</span> Ophir <span id="add-1KI.22.48" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">region</span> to get gold. But they were wrecked at Ezion-Geber/Elath, so the ships never sailed. <a href="#1KI.22.49"><sup id="1KI.22.49" class="usx-v">49</sup></a>
Before the ships were wrecked, Ahab’s son Ahaziah suggested to Jehoshaphat, “Allow my sailors to go with your sailors,” but Jehoshaphat refused.</p>
<p id="p-1KI.22.49" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.22.50"><sup id="1KI.22.50" class="usx-v">50</sup></a>
When Jehoshaphat died, his <span id="add-1KI.22.50" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">body</span> was buried where his ancestors were buried in <span id="add-1KI.22.50" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Jerusalem,</span> the city where King David <span id="add-1KI.22.50" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">had ruled</span>. Then Jehoshaphat’s son Jehoram became king.</p>
<p id="s1-1KI.22.50" class="usx-s1" >Ahaziah ruled in Israel</p>
<p id="p-1KI.22.50" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#1KI.22.51"><sup id="1KI.22.51" class="usx-v">51</sup></a>
Before King Jehoshaphat died, when he had been ruling in Judah for 17 years, Ahab’s son Ahaziah began to rule in Israel. Ahaziah ruled in Samaria for two years. <a href="#1KI.22.52"><sup id="1KI.22.52" class="usx-v">52</sup></a>
He did many things that Yahweh considered to be evil, doing the <span id="add-1KI.22.52" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">evil</span> things that his father and mother had done and the evil things that Jeroboam had done—the king who had led all the Israeli people to sin <span id="add-1KI.22.52" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">by worshiping idols</span>. <a href="#1KI.22.53"><sup id="1KI.22.53" class="usx-v">53</sup></a>
Ahaziah bowed in front of Baal’s idol and worshiped it. That caused Yahweh, the God who was the true God of the Israeli people, to become very angry, just as Ahaziah’s father had caused Yahweh to become angry.</p>
