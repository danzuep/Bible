Whoever among you is experiencing trouble [RHQ] should pray <span id="add-JAS.5.13" class="usx-add">that God would help him. Whoever</span> is cheerful/happy [RHQ] should sing songs of praise <span id="add-JAS.5.13" class="usx-add">to God</span>. <a href="#JAS.5.14"><sup id="JAS.5.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
Whoever among you is sick [RHQ] should call the leaders of the congregation <span id="add-JAS.5.14" class="usx-add">to come to pray for him</span>. They should put <span id="add-JAS.5.14" class="usx-add">olive</span> oil on him and, with the Lord’s authority [MTY] (OR, calling on the Lord <span id="add-JAS.5.14" class="usx-add">to heal him</span>), pray. <a href="#JAS.5.15"><sup id="JAS.5.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
And if they truly trust <span id="add-JAS.5.15" class="usx-add">in the Lord</span> when they pray [PRS], the sick person will be healed. The Lord will heal him.

So, <span id="add-JAS.5.16" class="usx-add">because the Lord is able to heal the sick and to forgive sins</span>, tell each other the sinful things that you have done, and pray for each other in order that you may be healed {that <span id="add-JAS.5.16" class="usx-add">God</span> may heal you} <span id="add-JAS.5.16" class="usx-add">physically and spiritually</span>. If righteous people <span id="add-JAS.5.16" class="usx-add">pray and</span> ask fervently <span id="add-JAS.5.16" class="usx-add">for God to do something, God</span> will certainly do it in a powerful way. <a href="#JAS.5.17"><sup id="JAS.5.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
<span id="add-JAS.5.17" class="usx-add">Although the prophet</span> Elijah was ◄an ordinary person/just a human being► like us, he earnestly prayed that it would not rain. <span id="add-JAS.5.17" class="usx-add">As a result</span>, it did not rain for three and a half years. <a href="#JAS.5.18"><sup id="JAS.5.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
