Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. <a href="#EXO.1.5"><sup id="EXO.1.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
Altogether there were 70 people <span id="add-EXO.1.5" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">who went with</span> Jacob. That included his <span id="add-EXO.1.5" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">sons, his grandsons, and two great-grandsons</span>. <span id="add-EXO.1.5" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">His son</span> Joseph was already in Egypt.</p>
<p id="p-EXO.1.5" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EXO.1.6"><sup id="EXO.1.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>

    <span id="add-EXO.1.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Eventually</span> Joseph and his <span id="add-EXO.1.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">older and younger</span> brothers and everyone <span id="add-EXO.1.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">else in their family who lived</span> ◄in that generation/at that time► died. <a href="#EXO.1.7"><sup id="EXO.1.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
But Jacob’s descendants kept giving birth to many children [IDM]. The number <span id="add-EXO.1.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">of his descendants</span> kept becoming larger and larger. As a result, there were so many of them that they were everywhere in Egypt (OR, that they <span id="add-EXO.1.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">became a threat</span> to the Egyptians). <a href="#EXO.1.8"><sup id="EXO.1.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
Then <span id="add-EXO.1.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">several hundred years later</span>, a new king began to rule [MTY] in Egypt. He did not know <span id="add-EXO.1.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">what</span> Joseph <span id="add-EXO.1.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">had done for the people of Egypt long ago</span>. <a href="#EXO.1.9"><sup id="EXO.1.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
He said to his people, “Look <span id="add-EXO.1.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">at what has happened</span>! The Israeli people have become so numerous and so powerful that they <span id="add-EXO.1.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">now might conquer</span> us! <a href="#EXO.1.10"><sup id="EXO.1.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
We must find a way to control them! If we do not do that, their population will continue to grow. Then, if enemies [PRS] attack us, they will join with our enemies and fight against us, and they will escape from <span id="add-EXO.1.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">our</span> land.”</p>
<p id="p-EXO.1.10" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EXO.1.11"><sup id="EXO.1.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
So <span id="add-EXO.1.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the king and his officials</span> put supervisors over the Israeli people to cause them to suffer very much by <span id="add-EXO.1.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">forcing them</span> to work very hard. They forced <span id="add-EXO.1.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the Israeli people to</span> build <span id="add-EXO.1.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">two</span> cities, Pithom and Ramses, in which to store <span id="add-EXO.1.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">supplies for the king/government</span>. <a href="#EXO.1.12"><sup id="EXO.1.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
But the more cruelly they treated the <span id="add-EXO.1.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Israeli people</span>, the bigger the Israeli <span id="add-EXO.1.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">population</span> grew, and they became more numerous all over <span id="add-EXO.1.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the land</span>. So the Egyptian people began to be afraid of the Israeli people. <a href="#EXO.1.13"><sup id="EXO.1.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
They forced the Israeli people to work very hard, <a href="#EXO.1.14"><sup id="EXO.1.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
and by making them slaves, they made their lives miserable. They <span id="add-EXO.1.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">forced them</span> to <span id="add-EXO.1.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">build many buildings with</span> mortar and bricks. <span id="add-EXO.1.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">They also forced them to do</span> other work in the fields. <span id="add-EXO.1.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">In making them do all this work, the Egyptian officials treated them</span> ruthlessly/cruelly.</p>
<p id="p-EXO.1.14" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EXO.1.15"><sup id="EXO.1.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
There were two Hebrew ◄midwives/women who helped the women when they were giving birth►. [Hebrew means the same as Israeli.] The names of the women were Shiphrah and Puah. The king of Egypt said to <span id="add-EXO.1.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">those two women</span>, <a href="#EXO.1.16"><sup id="EXO.1.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
“When you help the Hebrew women when they are giving birth [MTY], if <span id="add-EXO.1.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the baby that is born</span> is a boy, you must kill it. If <span id="add-EXO.1.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the baby</span> is a girl, you ◄may let it live/do not have to kill them►.” <a href="#EXO.1.17"><sup id="EXO.1.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
But the midwives feared/revered God. So they did not do what the king told them to do. They allowed the baby boys to live. <a href="#EXO.1.18"><sup id="EXO.1.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
So the king summoned the <span id="add-EXO.1.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">two</span> midwives and said to them, “Why are you doing this? Why are you letting the baby boys live?” <a href="#EXO.1.19"><sup id="EXO.1.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
<span id="add-EXO.1.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">One of</span> the midwives replied to the king, “<span id="add-EXO.1.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">You need to realize that</span> the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women. The Hebrew women are very strong/healthy. They give birth <span id="add-EXO.1.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to their babies</span> before we can get to them <span id="add-EXO.1.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to help them</span>.”</p>
<p id="p-EXO.1.19" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EXO.1.20"><sup id="EXO.1.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
So God acted kindly toward the midwives, and the <span id="add-EXO.1.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Hebrew</span> people became even more numerous and strong. <a href="#EXO.1.21"><sup id="EXO.1.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
Furthermore, because the midwives feared/revered God, he enabled them also to give birth to children.</p>
<p id="p-EXO.1.21" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EXO.1.22"><sup id="EXO.1.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
Then the king commanded all ◄the <span id="add-EXO.1.22" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Egyptian</span> people/his <span id="add-EXO.1.22" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">advisors</span>►: “You must throw into the Nile <span id="add-EXO.1.22" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">River</span> every baby boy born that the <span id="add-EXO.1.22" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Hebrew women</span> give birth to!

◄There was a man who/My father► was descended from <span id="add-EXO.2.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Jacob’s son</span> Levi. He married a woman who was <span id="add-EXO.2.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">also</span> descended from Levi. <a href="#EXO.2.2"><sup id="EXO.2.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
She became pregnant and gave birth to ◄a baby boy/me►. When she saw that he/I was a good-looking baby, she hid him/me for three months, <span id="add-EXO.2.2" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">because she was not willing to do what the king commanded</span>. <a href="#EXO.2.3"><sup id="EXO.2.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
When she was unable to ◄hide him/me/keep it a secret► any longer, she got a basket made from tall reeds. She covered the basket with tar ◄<span id="add-EXO.2.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to make it waterproof/so water could not get in</span>►. Then she put him/me in the basket and put the basket in <span id="add-EXO.2.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the water</span> in the middle of the tall grass at the edge of the Nile <span id="add-EXO.2.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">River</span>. <a href="#EXO.2.4"><sup id="EXO.2.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
His/My older sister was standing not far away, <span id="add-EXO.2.4" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">watching to see</span> what would happen to him/me.</p>

    <span id="add-EXO.2.5" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Soon</span> the king’s daughter went down to the river to bathe.

She saw the basket amid the tall grass <span id="add-EXO.2.5" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in the river</span>. So she sent <span id="add-EXO.2.5" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">one of</span> her servants to get it. <a href="#EXO.2.6"><sup id="EXO.2.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
When <span id="add-EXO.2.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the servant brought the basket to her</span>, she opened it, and was surprised to see ◄a baby that was/me►, crying. She felt sorry for him/me, and said, “This <span id="add-EXO.2.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">must</span> be one of the Hebrews’ babies.”</p>
<p id="p-EXO.2.6" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EXO.2.7"><sup id="EXO.2.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Then ◄the baby’s/my► <span id="add-EXO.2.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">older</span> sister <span id="add-EXO.2.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">approached</span> the king’s daughter and said, “Do you want me to go and find someone from among the Hebrew women who will <span id="add-EXO.2.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">be able to</span> nurse the baby for you?” <a href="#EXO.2.8"><sup id="EXO.2.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
The king’s daughter said to her, “<span id="add-EXO.2.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Yes</span>, go <span id="add-EXO.2.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and find one</span>.” So the girl went and summoned ◄the baby’s/my► mother. <a href="#EXO.2.9"><sup id="EXO.2.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>

◄<span id="add-EXO.2.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">A few years later</span>/when ◄the child/I► grew <span id="add-EXO.2.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">older</span>►, she brought him/me to the king’s daughter. She adopted him/me <span id="add-EXO.2.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">as though I was</span> her own son. She named him/me Moses, <span id="add-EXO.2.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">which sounds like the Hebrew words ‘pull out’</span>, because she said “I pulled him out of the water.”</p>

He/I saw how they were being <span id="add-EXO.2.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">forced to work</span> very hard. He/I <span id="add-EXO.2.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">also</span> saw an Egyptian <span id="add-EXO.2.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">man</span> beating one of his/my Hebrew people. <a href="#EXO.2.12"><sup id="EXO.2.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
He/I looked around <span id="add-EXO.2.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to see if anyone was watching</span>. Seeing no one, he/I killed the Egyptian man and buried his <span id="add-EXO.2.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">body</span> in the sand.</p>
<p id="p-EXO.2.12" class="usx-p" >

The next day he/I returned <span id="add-EXO.2.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to the same place</span>. He/I was surprised to see two Hebrew men who were fighting <span id="add-EXO.2.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">each other</span>.

    <span id="add-EXO.2.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">And that was correct</span>.

On their way, they baked bread with the dough that they carried with them when they had been expelled from Egypt.

On the day <span id="add-EXO.13.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the festival starts</span>, you must tell your children, ‘<span id="add-EXO.13.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">We are doing this to remember</span> what Yahweh did for our ancestors when they left Egypt. <a href="#EXO.13.9"><sup id="EXO.13.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
This ritual will remind you how Yahweh brought your ancestors out of Egypt with his great power [MTY]. <span id="add-EXO.13.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">The ritual will be like something</span> you tie on your forehead or on your wrist.

Yahweh will bring you into the land where the descendants of Canaan live, just as he promised you and your ancestors that he would do. When he gives that land to you, <a href="#EXO.13.12"><sup id="EXO.13.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
you must dedicate to Yahweh the firstborn males of all your animals. These all will belong to Yahweh. <a href="#EXO.13.13"><sup id="EXO.13.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
You may keep the firstborn male donkeys, but you must buy them back by sacrificing a lamb as a substitute for the donkey. If you do not want to buy back the donkey, you must <span id="add-EXO.13.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">kill it by</span> breaking its neck. You must also buy back every one of your own firstborn sons. <a href="#EXO.13.14"><sup id="EXO.13.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
In the future, when one of your children asks, ‘What does this mean?’, you must say to him, ‘Yahweh brought our ancestors out of Egypt with his great power [MTY], and freed us from being slaves there. <a href="#EXO.13.15"><sup id="EXO.13.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
The king of Egypt stubbornly refused to let them leave his country, so Yahweh killed all the firstborn males in Egypt, both the boys and the firstborn of their livestock. That is why we now sacrifice to Yahweh all the firstborn of our livestock, but we buy back our own firstborn sons.’ <a href="#EXO.13.16"><sup id="EXO.13.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
I repeat that this ritual will remind you about how Yahweh brought our <span id="add-EXO.13.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">ancestors</span> out of Egypt by his great power [MTY]; it will be like something you tie on your wrist or on your forehead <span id="add-EXO.13.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to remind you of that</span>.”</p>

When someone told the king that the Israeli people had left <span id="add-EXO.14.5" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">during the night</span>, he and his officials changed their minds and said, “◄What have we done?/What we have done was stupid!► [RHQ] The Israeli people will no longer be our slaves!” <a href="#EXO.14.6"><sup id="EXO.14.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>

Because Yahweh made the king of Egypt so stubborn that he and his army went to pursue the Israelis, who were leaving triumphantly, <a href="#EXO.14.9"><sup id="EXO.14.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
the Egyptian army, with all the king’s horses and chariots and horsemen, pursued the Israelis.

until it was between the Egyptian army and the Israeli people. The cloud caused the Egyptian army to be in the dark but it gave light for the Israelis. As a result, neither group could come near the other group during the whole night.</p>

Just before dawn, Yahweh looked down from the fiery cloud, and then he caused the Egyptian army to panic. <a href="#EXO.14.25"><sup id="EXO.14.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
He caused the wheels of the chariots to get stuck <span id="add-EXO.14.25" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in the mud</span>, so that they could hardly move. So the Egyptians said, “Yahweh is fighting for the Israelis and against us; let’s get out of here!”</p>

<p id="p-EXO.16.5" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EXO.16.6"><sup id="EXO.16.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
So Aaron and Moses/I said to all the Israeli people, “This evening you will know that it was Yahweh, <span id="add-EXO.16.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">not we</span>, who brought you out of Egypt. <a href="#EXO.16.7"><sup id="EXO.16.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>

<p id="p-EXO.16.8" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EXO.16.9"><sup id="EXO.16.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
Then Moses/I said to Aaron, “Tell all the Israeli people, ‘Come and stand here in the presence of Yahweh, because he has heard what you have been complaining about.’”</p>

    <a href="#EXO.16.10"><sup id="EXO.16.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
So Aaron told them that.

Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, <a href="#EXO.16.12"><sup id="EXO.16.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
“I have heard what the Israeli people have been complaining about. So say to them, ‘From now on, each evening, you will have meat to eat. And each morning you will have something that will take the place of bread. You will have all you want of it to eat.’ Then you will know that I, Yahweh, <span id="add-EXO.16.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">have the power to do what I say that I will do</span>.”</p>
<p id="p-EXO.16.12" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EXO.16.13"><sup id="EXO.16.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
That evening, ◄quails/small plump birds► appeared, and <span id="add-EXO.16.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">there were so many that</span> they covered the campsite. The next morning there was <span id="add-EXO.16.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">something like</span> dew all around the campsite. <a href="#EXO.16.14"><sup id="EXO.16.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
When the dew evaporated, on the surface of the desert there was a thick layer of something that looked like white flakes. It looked like frost. <a href="#EXO.16.15"><sup id="EXO.16.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
When the Israeli people saw it, since they <span id="add-EXO.16.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">had never seen it before and</span> did not know what it was, they said to each other, “What is it?” Moses/I replied to them, “It is something Yahweh has given you to eat, to take the place of bread. <a href="#EXO.16.16"><sup id="EXO.16.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
This is what Yahweh has commanded: ‘Each of you should gather as much as you need to eat. Gather two quarts/liters for each person who lives in your tents.’”</p>
<p id="p-EXO.16.16" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EXO.16.17"><sup id="EXO.16.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
So that is what the Israeli people did. Some gathered more and some gathered less. <a href="#EXO.16.18"><sup id="EXO.16.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
But when they measured <span id="add-EXO.16.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">what they had gathered</span>, those that had gathered a lot did not have anything left over.

<p id="p-EXO.16.18" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EXO.16.19"><sup id="EXO.16.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
Moses/I said to them, “Do not leave any of it to eat tomorrow morning!” <a href="#EXO.16.20"><sup id="EXO.16.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
But some of them did not pay any attention to what Moses/I said. They kept some of it until the next morning. But it was full of maggots and smelled rotten. And that made Moses/me angry.</p>
<p id="p-EXO.16.20" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EXO.16.21"><sup id="EXO.16.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>

    <a href="#EXO.16.22"><sup id="EXO.16.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
On the sixth day after they started gathering it, each person was able to gather four quarts/liters, which was twice <span id="add-EXO.16.22" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">as much as they gathered on the other days</span>.

Moses/I said to them, “This is what Yahweh has commanded: ‘Tomorrow will be a day for you to rest completely. It will be a day dedicated to Yahweh.

    <a href="#EXO.16.24"><sup id="EXO.16.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
So they did what Moses/I commanded. What was left over, they kept until the next day. It did not spoil and did not get maggots in it! <a href="#EXO.16.25"><sup id="EXO.16.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
<span id="add-EXO.16.25" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">On that day</span>, Moses/I said, “Eat today <span id="add-EXO.16.25" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">what you have saved from yesterday</span>, because today is a day dedicated to Yahweh.

On the seventh day, some of the people went outside their tents to gather some of that food, but there was none. <a href="#EXO.16.28"><sup id="EXO.16.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
Then Yahweh <span id="add-EXO.16.28" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">told Moses/me to say this to</span> the people: “How long will you people refuse to do all the things that I tell you? <a href="#EXO.16.29"><sup id="EXO.16.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>

The Israeli people called this food manna, <span id="add-EXO.16.31" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">which sounds like the words in their language that mean ‘what is it</span>?’ It looked like small seeds <span id="add-EXO.16.31" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">called</span> coriander, but it was white, and it tasted like thin wafers/biscuits made with honey. <a href="#EXO.16.32"><sup id="EXO.16.32" class="usx-v">32</sup></a>

Moses/I gave that place two names <span id="add-EXO.17.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in the Hebrew language:</span> Massah, <span id="add-EXO.17.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">which means ‘testing’</span>, and Meribah, <span id="add-EXO.17.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">which means ‘complaining’</span>. He/I gave it the name Massah because the Israeli people were testing Yahweh, saying “Is Yahweh really among us <span id="add-EXO.17.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and able to help us</span>, or not?”, and he/I gave it the name Meribah because they were <span id="add-EXO.17.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">continually</span> complaining.</p>

Then the descendants of the Amalek people-group came and fought against the Israeli people at Rephidim. <a href="#EXO.17.9"><sup id="EXO.17.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
Moses/I said to Joshua, <span id="add-EXO.17.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">who was one of our army/Israeli leaders</span>, “Choose some men to go out and fight against the Amalek people-group tomorrow.

And whenever he/I lowered his/my arms, the Amalek people-group started to win. <a href="#EXO.17.12"><sup id="EXO.17.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
But his/my arms became tired.

In that way, they kept his/my arms lifted up, and his/my arms held steady until the sun went down. <a href="#EXO.17.13"><sup id="EXO.17.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
So Joshua and the men with him completely defeated the Amalek people-group, using their swords <span id="add-EXO.17.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to fight against them</span>. <a href="#EXO.17.14"><sup id="EXO.17.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>

Her other son was named Eliezer, <span id="add-EXO.18.4" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">which sounds like the Hebrew words that mean ‘God helps me’</span>, because <span id="add-EXO.18.4" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">he/I</span> had said “God, whom my father <span id="add-EXO.18.4" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">worshiped</span>, has helped me and saved <span id="add-EXO.18.4" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">me</span> from being killed [MTY] by the king <span id="add-EXO.18.4" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">of Egypt</span>.”</p>

They made the sacred chest pouch. They made it of the same materials as the sacred apron and embroidered it in the same way. <a href="#EXO.39.9"><sup id="EXO.39.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
It was square, and the material was folded double, so that it was ◄9 in./22 cm.► long and ◄9 in./22 cm.► wide. <a href="#EXO.39.10"><sup id="EXO.39.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>

In the fourth row, they put a <span id="add-EXO.39.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">yellow</span> beryl, a <span id="add-EXO.39.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">red</span> carnelian, and a <span id="add-EXO.39.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">green</span> jasper.

On each of the twelve stones they engraved the name of one of the sons of Jacob, to represent one of the twelve Israeli tribes. <a href="#EXO.39.15"><sup id="EXO.39.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
They made two <span id="add-EXO.39.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">chains</span> from pure gold and braided them like cords, to <span id="add-EXO.39.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">attach</span> the sacred pouch <span id="add-EXO.39.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to the sacred apron</span>. <a href="#EXO.39.16"><sup id="EXO.39.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
They made two gold rings, and they attached them to the upper corners of the sacred pouch. <a href="#EXO.39.17"><sup id="EXO.39.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
They fastened one end of each cord to one of the rings. <a href="#EXO.39.18"><sup id="EXO.39.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
They fastened the other end of each cord to the two ◄settings/tiny frames► <span id="add-EXO.39.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that enclosed the stones</span>. Then they attached the sacred pouch to the shoulder straps of the sacred apron. <a href="#EXO.39.19"><sup id="EXO.39.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
Then they made two more gold rings and attached them to the lower corners of the sacred pouch, on the inside edges, next to the sacred apron. <a href="#EXO.39.20"><sup id="EXO.39.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
They made two more gold rings and attached them to the lower part of the front of the shoulder straps, near to where <span id="add-EXO.39.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the shoulder straps</span> were joined <span id="add-EXO.39.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to the sacred apron</span>, just above the carefully-woven sash/waistband. <a href="#EXO.39.21"><sup id="EXO.39.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
They tied the rings on the sacred pouch to the rings on the sacred apron with a blue cord, so that the sacred pouch was above the sash/waistband and would not come loose from the sacred apron.</p>
<p id="s1-EXO.39.21" class="usx-s1" >They made other special clothes for the priests</p>

They made the robe that is to be worn underneath the priest’s sacred apron, using only blue <span id="add-EXO.39.22" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">cloth</span>. <a href="#EXO.39.23"><sup id="EXO.39.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
It had an opening through which <span id="add-EXO.39.23" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the priest</span> would put his head. They sewed a border around this opening, to prevent the material from tearing. <a href="#EXO.39.24"><sup id="EXO.39.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
At the lower edge on the robe, they fastened <span id="add-EXO.39.24" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">decorations that resembled</span> pomegranate fruit. The decorations were <span id="add-EXO.39.24" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">woven from</span> blue, purple, and red yarn/thread. <a href="#EXO.39.25"><sup id="EXO.39.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
Between each of these decorations, they fastened a tiny bell made from pure gold, so there was a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, alternating all around the hem of the robe <a href="#EXO.39.26"><sup id="EXO.39.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>

They also made a turban of fine linen <span id="add-EXO.39.28" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">for Aaron to wear around his head</span>. They made the caps and the undershorts <span id="add-EXO.39.28" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">for Aaron’s sons</span> from fine linen. <a href="#EXO.39.29"><sup id="EXO.39.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>

They also made the tiny ornament of pure gold and had a skilled workman engrave on it the words, ‘Dedicated to Yahweh’. <a href="#EXO.39.31"><sup id="EXO.39.31" class="usx-v">31</sup></a>
They fastened this to the front of the turban by a blue cord, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses/me.</p>

    <a href="#EXO.39.32"><sup id="EXO.39.32" class="usx-v">32</sup></a>

The Israeli people had done all this work exactly as Yahweh had commanded Moses/me. <a href="#EXO.39.43"><sup id="EXO.39.43" class="usx-v">43</sup></a>
Then Moses/I saw all the work that they had done.

Then they spread out the coverings over the Sacred Tent, exactly as Yahweh had commanded. <a href="#EXO.40.20"><sup id="EXO.40.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
Then he/I took the two stone slabs <span id="add-EXO.40.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">on which the commandments were written</span> and put them in the sacred chest.

At the entrance to the Sacred Tent, he/I set the altar for offering sacrifices that were to be burned completely.

From that day, whenever the Israeli people wanted to move to another place, they went only when the bright cloud rose from above the Sacred Tent. <a href="#EXO.40.37"><sup id="EXO.40.37" class="usx-v">37</sup></a>
If the cloud did not rise, they stayed where they were and did not go on until the cloud rose. <a href="#EXO.40.38"><sup id="EXO.40.38" class="usx-v">38</sup></a>
Wherever they traveled, the bright cloud that <span id="add-EXO.40.38" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">indicated</span> Yahweh’s <span id="add-EXO.40.38" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">presence</span> was above the Sacred Tent during the day, and a <span id="add-EXO.40.38" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">bright</span> fire was inside the cloud at night, with the result that all the Israeli people [MTY] could see it <span id="add-EXO.40.38" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">at any time</span>.</p>
