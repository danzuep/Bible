<p id="p-GEN.1" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.1.1"><sup id="GEN.1.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
Long, long ago God created the heavens and the earth. <a href="#GEN.1.2"><sup id="GEN.1.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
When he began to create the earth, it was shapeless and completely desolate/chaotic. Darkness covered the deep water that surrounded the earth. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the water. <a href="#GEN.1.3"><sup id="GEN.1.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
God said, “I want light to shine!” And light shone. <a href="#GEN.1.4"><sup id="GEN.1.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
God was pleased with the light. Then he made the light to shine in some places, and in other places there was still darkness. <a href="#GEN.1.5"><sup id="GEN.1.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
He gave to the light the name ‘day’, and he gave to the darkness the name ‘night’. After that, there was an evening which was followed by a morning. He called that whole period of time ‘the first day’. <a href="#GEN.1.6"><sup id="GEN.1.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
Then God said, “I command that there be an empty space like a huge dome to separate the water that is above it from the water on the earth that is below it!” <a href="#GEN.1.7"><sup id="GEN.1.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
And that is what happened. God gave to the space the name ‘sky’. <a href="#GEN.1.8"><sup id="GEN.1.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
Then there was another evening, which was followed by another morning. He called that period of time ‘the second day’.</p>
<p id="p-GEN.1.8" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.1.9"><sup id="GEN.1.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
Then God said, “I want the water that is below the sky to come together, and dry ground to appear and rise above the water.” And that is what happened. <a href="#GEN.1.10"><sup id="GEN.1.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
God gave to the ground the name ‘earth’, and he gave to the water that came together the name ‘oceans’. God was pleased with the earth and the oceans. <a href="#GEN.1.11"><sup id="GEN.1.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
Then God said, “I want the earth to produce plants, including plants that will produce seeds and trees that will produce fruit. Each kind of tree will bear its own kind of fruit.” <a href="#GEN.1.12"><sup id="GEN.1.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
Then plants grew on the earth; each kind of plant began to produce its own kind of seed. <a href="#GEN.1.13"><sup id="GEN.1.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Then there was another evening which was followed by another morning. God called that period of time ‘the third day’.</p>
<p id="p-GEN.1.13" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.1.14"><sup id="GEN.1.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
Then God said, “I want a sun, a moon, and many stars to shine in the sky. The sun will shine in the daytime and the moon and stars will shine during the nighttime. By the changes in their appearance they will indicate the various seasons (OR, the times for special celebrations), and will enable people to know when days and years begin. <a href="#GEN.1.15"><sup id="GEN.1.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
I want them also to be like lights in the sky that will shine on the earth.” And that is what happened. <a href="#GEN.1.16"><sup id="GEN.1.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
God made two of them that were like big lights. The bigger one, the sun, shines during the day and the smaller one, the moon, shines during the night. He also made the stars. <a href="#GEN.1.17"><sup id="GEN.1.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
God set all of them in the sky to shine on the earth, <a href="#GEN.1.18"><sup id="GEN.1.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
to rule the day and the night, and to separate the light of the daytime from the darkness of the nighttime. God was pleased with these things he had made. <a href="#GEN.1.19"><sup id="GEN.1.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
Then there was another evening which was followed by another morning. He called that period of time ‘the fourth day’. <a href="#GEN.1.20"><sup id="GEN.1.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
Then God said, “I want many creatures to live in all the oceans, and I also want birds to fly in the sky above the earth.” <a href="#GEN.1.21"><sup id="GEN.1.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
So God created huge sea creatures and every other kind of creature that moves in the water, and caused them to live in all the oceans. He also created many kinds of birds. God was pleased with all those creatures. <a href="#GEN.1.22"><sup id="GEN.1.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
God blessed them. He said, “Produce offspring and become very numerous. I want the creatures in the water to live in all the oceans, and birds also to become very numerous.” And that is what happened. <a href="#GEN.1.23"><sup id="GEN.1.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
Then there was another evening that was followed by another morning. He called that period of time ‘the fifth day’. <a href="#GEN.1.24"><sup id="GEN.1.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
Then God said, “I want various kinds of creatures to appear on the earth. There will be many kinds of ◄livestock/domestic animals►, creatures that scurry across the ground, and large wild animals.” And that is what happened. <a href="#GEN.1.25"><sup id="GEN.1.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
God made all kinds of wild animals and ◄livestock/domestic animals► and all kinds of creatures that scurry across the ground. God was pleased with all these creatures.</p>
<p id="p-GEN.1.25" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.1.26"><sup id="GEN.1.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
Then God said, “Now we will make human beings that will be like us in many ways. I want them to rule over the fish in the sea, over the birds, over all the ◄livestock/domestic animals►, and over all the other creatures that scurry across the ground.” <a href="#GEN.1.27"><sup id="GEN.1.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
So God created human beings that were like him in many ways. He made them to be like himself. He created some to be male and some to be female. <a href="#GEN.1.28"><sup id="GEN.1.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
God blessed them, saying, “Produce many children, who will live all over the earth and rule over it. I want them to rule over the fish and the birds and over all creatures that scurry across the ground.” <a href="#GEN.1.29"><sup id="GEN.1.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>
God said to the humans, “Listen! I have given you all the plants that produce seeds, all over the earth, and all the trees that have seeds in their fruit. All these things are for you to eat. <a href="#GEN.1.30"><sup id="GEN.1.30" class="usx-v">30</sup></a>
I have given all the green plants to all the wild animals and to the birds and to all the creatures that scurry across the ground, to everything that breathes, for them to eat.” And that is what happened. <a href="#GEN.1.31"><sup id="GEN.1.31" class="usx-v">31</sup></a>
God was pleased with everything that he had made. Truly, it was all very good. Then there was another evening, that was followed by another morning. He called that period of time ‘the sixth day’.</p>
<a href="#GEN.2"><h3 id="GEN.2" class="usx-c">2</h3></a>
<p id="p-GEN.2" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.2.1"><sup id="GEN.2.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
That is the way God created the heavens and the earth. <a href="#GEN.2.2"><sup id="GEN.2.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
By the time it was the seventh day, God had finished the work of creating everything, so he did not work any more on that day. <a href="#GEN.2.3"><sup id="GEN.2.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
God blessed each seventh day, and he set those days apart to be special days, because on the seventh day God did not work any more, after finishing all his work of creating everything. <a href="#GEN.2.4"><sup id="GEN.2.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
That is how God created the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p id="s1-GEN.2.4" class="usx-s1" >God made the garden of Eden</p>
<p id="p-GEN.2.4" class="usx-p" >God, whose name is Yahweh, made the heavens and the earth. <a href="#GEN.2.5"><sup id="GEN.2.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
At first there were no plants growing, because Yahweh God had not yet caused rain to fall on the ground. Furthermore, there was no one to till the ground for planting crops. <a href="#GEN.2.6"><sup id="GEN.2.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
Instead, mist rose up from the ground, so that it watered the surface of the ground. <a href="#GEN.2.7"><sup id="GEN.2.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Then Yahweh God took some soil and formed a man. He breathed into the man’s nostrils his own breath that gives life, and as a result the man became a living person. <a href="#GEN.2.8"><sup id="GEN.2.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
Yahweh God made a park/garden in a place named Eden, which was east of the land of Canaan, and he put there the man that he had created. <a href="#GEN.2.9"><sup id="GEN.2.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
Yahweh God also put there every kind of tree that is beautiful to see and that produced fruit that was good to eat. He also placed in the middle of the park/garden a tree <span id="add-GEN.2.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">whose fruit would enable those who ate it</span> to live forever. He also placed there another tree whose fruit would enable those who ate it to know what actions were good <span id="add-GEN.2.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to do</span> and what actions were evil <span id="add-GEN.2.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to do</span>.</p>
<p id="p-GEN.2.9" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.2.10"><sup id="GEN.2.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
A river flowed from Eden to provide water for the park/garden. Outside of Eden, the river divided into four rivers. <a href="#GEN.2.11"><sup id="GEN.2.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
The name of the first river is Pishon. That river flows through all the land of Havilah, where there is gold. <a href="#GEN.2.12"><sup id="GEN.2.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
That gold ◄is very pure/has no impurities in it►. There is <span id="add-GEN.2.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">also a sweet-smelling gum called</span> bdellium, and valuable stones called onyx. <a href="#GEN.2.13"><sup id="GEN.2.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
The name of the second river is Gihon. That river flows through all the land of Cain. <a href="#GEN.2.14"><sup id="GEN.2.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
The name of the third river is Tigris. It flows east of <span id="add-GEN.2.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the city of</span> Asshur. The name of the fourth river is Euphrates.</p>
<p id="p-GEN.2.14" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.2.15"><sup id="GEN.2.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
Yahweh God took the man and put him in Eden park/garden to till/cultivate it and take care of it. <a href="#GEN.2.16-17"><sup id="GEN.2.16-17" class="usx-v">16-17</sup></a>
But Yahweh said to him, “You must not eat the fruit of the tree that will enable you to know what actions are good to do and what actions are evil to do. If you eat any fruit from that tree, on that day your relationship with me will end. But I will permit you to eat the fruit of any of the other trees in the park/garden.”</p>
<p id="p-GEN.2.16-17" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.2.18"><sup id="GEN.2.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
Then Yahweh God said, “It is not good for this man to be alone. So I will make someone who will be a suitable partner for him.” <a href="#GEN.2.19"><sup id="GEN.2.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
Yahweh God had taken some soil and had formed from it all kinds of animals and birds, and he brought them to the man to hear what names he would give them. <a href="#GEN.2.20"><sup id="GEN.2.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
Then the man gave names to all the kinds of livestock and birds and wild animals, but none of these creatures was a partner that was suitable for the man. <a href="#GEN.2.21"><sup id="GEN.2.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
So Yahweh God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep. While the man was sleeping, Yahweh took out one of the man’s ribs. Then he immediately closed the opening in his body <span id="add-GEN.2.21" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and healed it</span>. <a href="#GEN.2.22"><sup id="GEN.2.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
Yahweh then made a woman from the rib that he had taken from the man’s body, and he brought her to the man. <a href="#GEN.2.23"><sup id="GEN.2.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
The man exclaimed, “<span id="add-GEN.2.23" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Wow</span>! This is truly ◄someone like me/what I was looking for!► She is truly from my bones and from my flesh. So I will call her woman, because she was taken from me, a man.”</p>
<p id="p-GEN.2.23" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.2.24"><sup id="GEN.2.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>

    <span id="add-GEN.2.24" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">The first woman was taken from the man’s body,</span> so that is why when a man and a woman marry, they must leave their parents.

    <a href="#GEN.3.1"><sup id="GEN.3.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
The snake was more cunning than all the other wild animals that Yahweh God had made. <span id="add-GEN.3.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">One day Satan gave to</span> the snake <span id="add-GEN.3.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the ability to talk to the woman</span>. The snake said to her, “Did God really say to you, ‘Do not eat the fruit from any of the trees in the park/garden’?” <a href="#GEN.3.2-3"><sup id="GEN.3.2-3" class="usx-v">2-3</sup></a>
The woman replied, “<span id="add-GEN.3.2-3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">What God said was</span>, ‘Do not eat the fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the park/garden or touch it. If you do that, you will die. But you can eat fruit from any of the other trees.’” <a href="#GEN.3.4"><sup id="GEN.3.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
The snake said to the woman, “No, you will certainly not die. God said that <a href="#GEN.3.5"><sup id="GEN.3.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
<span id="add-GEN.3.5" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">only</span> because he knows that when you eat fruit from that tree, <span id="add-GEN.3.5" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">you will understand new things.

The woman saw that the fruit on that tree was good to eat, and it was very beautiful, and she desired it because <span id="add-GEN.3.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">she thought</span> it would make her wise. So she picked some of the fruit and ate it. Then she gave some to her husband, and he ate it. <a href="#GEN.3.7"><sup id="GEN.3.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Immediately <span id="add-GEN.3.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">it was as though</span> their eyes were opened, and they realized that they were naked, so they were ashamed. So they <span id="add-GEN.3.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">picked</span> some fig leaves and fastened them together to make clothes for themselves.</p>

    <span id="add-GEN.3.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Late that afternoon</span>, when a cool breeze was blowing, they heard the sound/footsteps of Yahweh as he was walking in the park/garden.

But Yahweh God called to the man, saying to him, “Why are you <span id="add-GEN.3.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">trying to hide from me</span>?” <a href="#GEN.3.10"><sup id="GEN.3.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
The man replied, “I heard the sound of your <span id="add-GEN.3.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">footsteps/walking</span> in the garden, and I was naked, so I was afraid and I hid myself.” <a href="#GEN.3.11"><sup id="GEN.3.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
God said, “How did you find out you were naked [RHQ]?

The man said, “You gave me this woman to be with me. She is the one who gave me some of the fruit from that tree, and so I ate it.” <a href="#GEN.3.13"><sup id="GEN.3.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Then Yahweh God said to the woman, “Why did you do such a thing?” The woman replied, “I ate some of the fruit because the snake deceived me.” <a href="#GEN.3.14"><sup id="GEN.3.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>

This is why: Noah was a man who always acted in a righteous way. No one who lived at that time could criticize him about anything. Noah lived in close fellowship with God. <a href="#GEN.6.10"><sup id="GEN.6.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>

When Yahweh smelled the pleasant odor, he was pleased with the sacrifice. Then he said to himself, “I will never again devastate everything on the earth because of the sinful things people do.

In a region to the east, there were four kings <span id="add-GEN.14.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">who were friends/allies</span>.

In an area to the west, there were five other kings. They were King Bera of Sodom, King Birsha of Gomorrah, King Shinab of Admah, King Shemeber of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, the city that is now called Zoar. <a href="#GEN.14.3"><sup id="GEN.14.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>

King Chedorlaomer and his army <span id="add-GEN.14.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">conquered the armies of those five kings, and demanded that those kings pay him tribute money each year</span>. <a href="#GEN.14.4"><sup id="GEN.14.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
For twelve years he ruled them. But during the thirteenth year they rebelled <span id="add-GEN.14.4" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and refused to keep giving him tribute money</span>. <a href="#GEN.14.5"><sup id="GEN.14.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
The next year, King Chedorlaomer and the other kings that were his allies took their armies and defeated the Repha people-group in Ashteroth-Karnaim and the Zuz people-group in Ham, and the Emi people-group in Shaveh-Kiriathaim. <a href="#GEN.14.6"><sup id="GEN.14.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
They also defeated the Hor people-group in the hilly area of Seir as far as El-Paran near the desert. <a href="#GEN.14.7"><sup id="GEN.14.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Then they turned back and went to Mishpat <span id="add-GEN.14.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">city</span>, which is now called Kadesh.

Then the armies of the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim and Bela marched out to fight the armies of the other four kings in Siddim Valley. That valley is close to the Salt/Dead Sea. <a href="#GEN.14.9"><sup id="GEN.14.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
They fought against the armies of Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, Tidal the king of Goiim, Amraphel the king of Shinar, and Arioch the king of Ellasar. The armies of four kings were fighting against the armies of five kings. <a href="#GEN.14.10"><sup id="GEN.14.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
The Siddim Valley was full of tar pits. So when the armies of the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah tried to run away, many of the men fell into the tar pits. The others escaped and ran away to the hills. <a href="#GEN.14.11"><sup id="GEN.14.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
As <span id="add-GEN.14.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the armies of the five kings</span> fled, <span id="add-GEN.14.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the armies of the four kings</span> seized all of the valuable things in Sodom and Gomorrah, including all the food. <a href="#GEN.14.12"><sup id="GEN.14.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
They also captured Abram’s nephew Lot and his possessions, since he was living in Sodom at that time. <a href="#GEN.14.13"><sup id="GEN.14.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Abram was living near the big trees near Mamre, who belonged to the Amor people-group.

One of the men who escaped from the battle told Abram what had happened and that his nephew Lot had been captured and taken away. So Abram summoned 318 men who were his servants, men who had been with Abram since they were born. They all went together and pursued their enemies as far north as Dan <span id="add-GEN.14.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">city</span>. <a href="#GEN.14.15"><sup id="GEN.14.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
During the night, Abram divided the men into several groups, and they attacked their enemies from various directions and defeated them.

Abram’s men recovered all of the goods that had been taken. They also rescued Lot and all his possessions and also the women and others who had been captured by their enemies.</p>

As Abram was returning home after he and his men had defeated the armies of King Chedorlaomer and the other kings who had fought alongside him, the king of Sodom went north to meet him in Shaveh Valley, which people call the King’s Valley. <a href="#GEN.14.18"><sup id="GEN.14.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
The king of Salem <span id="add-GEN.14.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">city</span>, whose name was Melchizedek, was also a priest who offered sacrifices to the Supreme God. He brought some bread and wine to Abram. <a href="#GEN.14.19"><sup id="GEN.14.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
Then he blessed Abram, saying “I ask the Supreme God, the one who created heaven and earth, to bless you. <a href="#GEN.14.20"><sup id="GEN.14.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
The Supreme God has enabled you to defeat [MTY] your enemies, so we should praise/thank him.” Then Abram gave to Melchizedek a tenth part of all the things he had captured. <a href="#GEN.14.21"><sup id="GEN.14.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
The king of Sodom said to Abram, “You can keep all the goods you recovered. Just let me take back the people from my city whom you rescued.” <a href="#GEN.14.22"><sup id="GEN.14.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
But Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have solemnly promised [MTY] to Yahweh, the Supreme God, the one who created heaven and earth, <a href="#GEN.14.23"><sup id="GEN.14.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
that I will not accept even one thread or a thong of a sandal from anything that belongs to you. As a result, you will never be able to say, ‘I caused Abram to become rich.’ <a href="#GEN.14.24"><sup id="GEN.14.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
The only thing I will accept is the food that my men have eaten.

<p id="s1-GEN.15" class="usx-s1" >Yahweh made a solemn promise to Abram</p>

    <a href="#GEN.15.1"><sup id="GEN.15.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
Some time later, Abram had a vision in which Yahweh spoke to him and said, “Do not be afraid of ◄anything/your enemies►. I will protect you [MTY], and I will give a great reward.” <a href="#GEN.15.2"><sup id="GEN.15.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
But Abram replied, “Yahweh God, how can you give me what I truly want, because I have no children, and the one who will be like a son and inherit all my possessions is my servant Eliezer from Damascus!” <a href="#GEN.15.3"><sup id="GEN.15.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
Abram added, “You have not given me any children, so think about this: A servant in my household will inherit all I own!” <a href="#GEN.15.4"><sup id="GEN.15.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
Yahweh replied, “No! He will not be the one who will inherit it. Instead, you yourself will be the father of the one who will inherit everything you own.” <a href="#GEN.15.5"><sup id="GEN.15.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
Then Yahweh took Abram outside <span id="add-GEN.15.5" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">of his tent</span> and said, “Look up at the sky! Can you count the stars? No, you cannot count them because there are so many of them, and your descendants will be as numerous as the stars.” <a href="#GEN.15.6"><sup id="GEN.15.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
Abram believed that what Yahweh said would happen. And because of that, Yahweh considered that Abram was righteous. <a href="#GEN.15.7"><sup id="GEN.15.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Yahweh also said to him, “I am Yahweh. I am the one who brought you from Ur in Chaldea land. I brought you here to give you this land to possess.” <a href="#GEN.15.8"><sup id="GEN.15.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
But Abram replied, “Yahweh God, how can I know for sure that this land will belong to me?” <a href="#GEN.15.9"><sup id="GEN.15.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
God said to him, “Bring a three-year-old heifer and a three-year-old goat to me, and a dove and a pigeon.” <a href="#GEN.15.10"><sup id="GEN.15.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
So Abram brought all of them and killed them and cut each of the animals in half. He arranged the halves of each one, side by side. But he did not cut the pigeon and dove in half. <a href="#GEN.15.11"><sup id="GEN.15.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
Birds that eat dead flesh came down to eat the carcasses, but Abram shooed them away. <a href="#GEN.15.12"><sup id="GEN.15.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
As the sun was going down, Abram fell sound asleep, and suddenly everything around him became dark and frightening. <a href="#GEN.15.13"><sup id="GEN.15.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Then God said to Abram, “I want you to know that your descendants will become foreigners living in a land that does not belong to them. They will become slaves of the owners of that land. The owners of the land will mistreat them for 400 years. <a href="#GEN.15.14"><sup id="GEN.15.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
But then I will punish the people of that country that made them become slaves, and then your descendants will leave that country, taking many possessions with them. <a href="#GEN.15.15"><sup id="GEN.15.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
But as for you, you will die [EUP] peacefully when you are very old. <a href="#GEN.15.16"><sup id="GEN.15.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
After your descendants have been slaves for 400 years, they will return here, and take control of this land and defeat the Amor people-group. Those people will, because those people have not yet sinned enough to deserve to be punished now.” <a href="#GEN.15.17"><sup id="GEN.15.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
When the sun had set and it had become dark, <span id="add-GEN.15.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">unexpectedly</span> a blazing torch and a clay pot containing burning coals from which smoke was rising appeared and went between the halves of the animals. <a href="#GEN.15.18"><sup id="GEN.15.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
And on that day Yahweh made an agreement with Abram. Yahweh told him, “I will give to your descendants all the land between the river that is on the eastern border of Egypt to the south, and north to the huge Euphrates River. <a href="#GEN.15.19"><sup id="GEN.15.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>

An angel of Yahweh found her as she was near a spring of water in the desert. It was the spring that was alongside the road to Shur. <a href="#GEN.16.8"><sup id="GEN.16.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>

Then Hagar realized that the angel was really Yahweh, so she said to herself, “◄It is difficult to believe that I have really seen the back of Yahweh, the one who sees me!/Have I really seen the back of Yahweh, the one who sees me?►” [RHQ] So she called him ‘Yahweh, the one who sees me’. <a href="#GEN.16.14"><sup id="GEN.16.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>

Abraham prostrated himself with his face on the ground <span id="add-GEN.17.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to show respect to God</span>. But then he laughed as he said to himself, “Can a man who is a 100 years old become a father of a son?

Abraham looked up [MTY] and was surprised to see three men standing near him. <span id="add-GEN.18.2" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Actually, one was Yahweh, and the other two were angels</span>.

and said <span id="add-GEN.18.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to one of them</span>, “Sir, if you are pleased with me, stay here for a little while [LIT]. <a href="#GEN.18.4"><sup id="GEN.18.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>

Since you have come here to me, allow me to bring you some food [SYN] so that you can feel refreshed before you leave.” Yahweh replied, “All right, do as you have said.” <a href="#GEN.18.6"><sup id="GEN.18.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
So Abraham quickly went into the tent and said to Sarah, “Quick, get some of our best flour and make some loaves of bread!” <a href="#GEN.18.7"><sup id="GEN.18.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Then he ran to the herd of cattle and selected a calf whose meat would be tender and tasty.

When the meat was cooked, Abraham brought some curds and milk and the meat that had been prepared, and set them in front of his visitors. Then he stood near them, under a tree, while they ate. <a href="#GEN.18.9"><sup id="GEN.18.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
<span id="add-GEN.18.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">One of</span> them asked him, “Where is Sarah, your wife?” He replied, “She is in the tent.” <a href="#GEN.18.10"><sup id="GEN.18.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
Then the leader of the group said, “I will return to you ◄about this time/in the springtime► next year, and to your amazement, your wife Sarah will have an infant son.” It happened that Sarah was listening at the entrance of the tent, which was behind the one who was speaking. <a href="#GEN.18.11"><sup id="GEN.18.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
Abraham and Sarah were very old, and Sarah was far past the time of when she could bear children. <a href="#GEN.18.12"><sup id="GEN.18.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
So Sarah laughed to herself, thinking, “My body is worn out, and my husband is old. So how can I have the pleasure <span id="add-GEN.18.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">of having a child</span>?” [RHQ] <a href="#GEN.18.13"><sup id="GEN.18.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>

I am Yahweh! ◄Is there anything too difficult for me?/There is nothing too difficult for me!► [RHQ] I will return about this time next year in the springtime, and Sarah will have an infant son.” <a href="#GEN.18.15"><sup id="GEN.18.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
Then Sarah was afraid, so she lied and said, “I did not laugh.” But Yahweh said, “Don’t deny it! You did laugh.”</p>

When the three men got up to leave, they looked down into the valley toward Sodom <span id="add-GEN.18.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">city</span>. Abraham was walking with them to say “goodbye” to them. <a href="#GEN.18.17"><sup id="GEN.18.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
Yahweh thought to himself, “It is not right for me to prevent Abraham from knowing what I plan to do [RHQ]. <a href="#GEN.18.18"><sup id="GEN.18.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
Abraham’s descendants [MTY] will become a great and powerful nation. And people of [MTY] all nations will be blessed because of what I do for him. <a href="#GEN.18.19"><sup id="GEN.18.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>

So Yahweh said to Abraham, “I have heard the terrible things that have been said about the people of [MTY] Sodom and Gomorrah. Their sins are very great. <a href="#GEN.18.21"><sup id="GEN.18.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
So I will go down now, and I will see if all the terrible things that I have heard are true or not true.” <a href="#GEN.18.22"><sup id="GEN.18.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
Then the two men turned and started walking toward Sodom. But Yahweh remained, standing in front of Abraham. <a href="#GEN.18.23"><sup id="GEN.18.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
Abraham came closer to him and said, “Will you really destroy righteous people along with wicked ones? <a href="#GEN.18.24"><sup id="GEN.18.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
What will you do if there are only 50 righteous people in the city? Will you really get rid of them all, and not spare the place/city for the sake of the 50 righteous people who are in the city? <a href="#GEN.18.25"><sup id="GEN.18.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
It would certainly not be right for you to do such a thing, to kill righteous people along with wicked ones, and treat righteous people and wicked people the same way.

Yahweh replied, “If I find 50 righteous people in Sodom, I will spare the whole place/city for their sake.” <a href="#GEN.18.27"><sup id="GEN.18.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
Abraham replied, “I should not be bold like this and speak to you, God, because I am as worthless as dust and ashes [MET]. <a href="#GEN.18.28"><sup id="GEN.18.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
But what will you do if there are only 45 righteous people?

Abraham continued to speak to him <span id="add-GEN.18.29" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">like this</span>, saying, “What will you do if you find that there are only 40 righteous people there?” Yahweh replied, “I will not destroy them all, for the sake of the 40.” <a href="#GEN.18.30"><sup id="GEN.18.30" class="usx-v">30</sup></a>
Abraham said, “God, please don’t be angry now. Let me speak again. What will you do if there are only 30 righteous people?” He replied, “I will not do it if I find that there are 30 there.” <a href="#GEN.18.31"><sup id="GEN.18.31" class="usx-v">31</sup></a>
Abraham said, “I should not be bold and speak to you like this, God. But what will you do if you find that there are only 20 righteous people there?” He replied, “I will not destroy the whole city, for the sake of those 20.” <a href="#GEN.18.32"><sup id="GEN.18.32" class="usx-v">32</sup></a>

But Lot kept insisting strongly that they sleep in his house. So they entered his house with him, and he prepared a meal for them. He baked some bread without yeast, and they ate it. <a href="#GEN.19.4"><sup id="GEN.19.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
After they finished eating, before they went to bed, the men of Sodom <span id="add-GEN.19.4" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">city</span>, all of them, from the young ones to the old ones, surrounded the house. <a href="#GEN.19.5"><sup id="GEN.19.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>

Lot went outside the house and shut the door behind him, so that they could not go inside. <a href="#GEN.19.7"><sup id="GEN.19.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
He said to them, “My friends, don’t do such an evil thing! <a href="#GEN.19.8"><sup id="GEN.19.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
Listen to me. I have two daughters who have never had sex with any man. Let me bring them out to you now, and you can do with them whatever pleases you.

But they replied, “Get out of our way!

But the two angels opened the door carefully, reached out their hands, and pulled Lot to them inside the house. Then they quickly shut the door. <a href="#GEN.19.11"><sup id="GEN.19.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
Then they caused all the men who were outside the door of the house, young and old, to become blind, so that they could not find the door. <a href="#GEN.19.12"><sup id="GEN.19.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
Then the two angels said to Lot, “Who else is with you here? If you have sons or sons-in-law or daughters or anyone else in the city who is related to you, take them out of the city, <a href="#GEN.19.13"><sup id="GEN.19.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>

So Lot went and spoke to the men who had pledged to marry his daughters. He said to them, “Hurry! Get out of this city, because Yahweh is about to destroy it!” But his future sons-in-law thought he was joking. <a href="#GEN.19.15"><sup id="GEN.19.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
As it was about to dawn the next morning, the two angels urged Lot, saying, “Get up quickly! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here with you and leave!

When Lot hesitated, the angels grasped his hand and his wife’s hand and the hands of his two daughters. They led them outside the city safely. The angels did that because Yahweh was acting mercifully toward them. <a href="#GEN.19.17"><sup id="GEN.19.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>

But hurry! Run there, because I cannot destroy anything until you arrive there.” People later called the name of the town Zoar <span id="add-GEN.19.22" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">which means ‘small’,</span> because Lot said it was small.</p>

As the sun was rising, Lot and his family arrived in the town which is now called Zoar. <a href="#GEN.19.24"><sup id="GEN.19.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>

But Lot’s wife stopped and looked back <span id="add-GEN.19.26" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to see what was happening</span>, so she died, and her body <span id="add-GEN.19.26" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">later</span> became a pillar of salt.</p>

    <a href="#GEN.20.1"><sup id="GEN.20.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
Abraham left Mamre and moved southwest to the Negev desert and lived in a place named Gerar, between Kadesh and Shur. <a href="#GEN.20.2"><sup id="GEN.20.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
While he was there, he told people that Sarah was his sister, not his wife. Then King Abimelech of Gerar sent some of his men to Sarah, and they brought her to him to be his wife. <a href="#GEN.20.3"><sup id="GEN.20.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
But God appeared to Abimelech in a dream during the night and said to him, “Listen to me! You are going to die because the woman you took is another man’s wife.” <a href="#GEN.20.4"><sup id="GEN.20.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
But Abimelech had not had sex [EUP] with her, so he said, “God, since the people of my nation and I am innocent; will you kill me? <a href="#GEN.20.5"><sup id="GEN.20.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
He told me, ‘She is my sister,’ and she also said, ‘He is my brother.’ I did this with pure motives and I [SYN] have not done anything wrong yet.” <a href="#GEN.20.6"><sup id="GEN.20.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
God said to him in another dream, “Yes, I know that your motives were pure. That is why I truly prevented you from sinning against me. I did not allow you to have sex [EUP] with her. <a href="#GEN.20.7"><sup id="GEN.20.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Now, return this man’s wife to her husband, because he is ◄a prophet/a man who receives messages from me►. He will pray for you, and you will ◄remain alive/not die►. But if you do not return her to him, you will certainly die, and all the members of your household will also certainly die.” <a href="#GEN.20.8"><sup id="GEN.20.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
Early the next morning, Abimelech summoned all his officials, and told them everything that had happened. When they heard that [MTY], his men were very afraid <span id="add-GEN.20.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that God would punish them</span>. <a href="#GEN.20.9"><sup id="GEN.20.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
Abimelech then summoned Abraham, and said to him, “You should not have done that to us [RHQ]! Did I do something wrong to you, with the result that you are causing me and the people in [MTY] my kingdom to be guilty of committing a great sin [RHQ]? You have done things to me that ◄should not be done/you should not have done►!” <a href="#GEN.20.10"><sup id="GEN.20.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
Abimelech asked Abraham, “What was your reason for doing this?” <a href="#GEN.20.11"><sup id="GEN.20.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
Abraham replied, “I said that because I thought, ‘They certainly do not respect God in this place. If they don’t respect God, they will not respect relationships with others. <span id="add-GEN.20.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">If I say she is my sister, they will try to pay me a bride price</span> to get her.

Besides, she really <span id="add-GEN.20.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">can be considered</span> my sister, because she is the daughter of my father, although she is not the daughter of my mother. She is the daughter of another woman, and I married her. <a href="#GEN.20.13"><sup id="GEN.20.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Later, when God told me to move away from my father’s household, I said to her, ‘This is the way you can show that you love me: Everywhere we go, say about me, “This is my brother.”’” <a href="#GEN.20.14"><sup id="GEN.20.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
So Abimelech brought some sheep and cattle and male and female slaves and gave them to Abraham. And he returned his wife Sarah to him. <a href="#GEN.20.15"><sup id="GEN.20.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
And Abimelech said to him, “Look! All my land is here in front of you. Live in whatever place you like!” <a href="#GEN.20.16"><sup id="GEN.20.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
And he said to Sarah, “Look here, I am giving 1,000 pieces of silver to your brother.

Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech’s wife and his slave girls so that they could become pregnant. <a href="#GEN.20.18"><sup id="GEN.20.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
This was because Yahweh had caused it to be impossible for any of the women in Abimelech’s household to bear children, because Abimelech had taken Abraham’s wife Sarah.</p>

Yahweh was very kind to Sarah, just as he said he would be. He did for Sarah exactly what he promised to do. <a href="#GEN.21.2"><sup id="GEN.21.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
She became pregnant and gave birth to a son for Abraham when he was very old, at the time God promised it would happen. <a href="#GEN.21.3"><sup id="GEN.21.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
Abraham gave the name ‘Isaac’ (which means ‘he laughs’) to the son Sarah gave birth to. <a href="#GEN.21.4"><sup id="GEN.21.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when his son was eight days old, just as God commanded him to do. <a href="#GEN.21.5"><sup id="GEN.21.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
Abraham was 100 years old when his son Isaac was born. <a href="#GEN.21.6"><sup id="GEN.21.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
And Sarah said, “<span id="add-GEN.21.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Although I was sad before because I did not have any children</span>, God has now enabled me to laugh, and everyone who hears about what God has done for me will laugh with me.” <a href="#GEN.21.7"><sup id="GEN.21.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Then she also said, “No one would have said to Abraham that some day Sarah would nurse a child, but I have given birth to a son when Abraham is very old.”</p>
<p id="s1-GEN.21.7" class="usx-s1" >Abraham sent Hagar and her son Ishmael away</p>

The baby grew and was weaned <span id="add-GEN.21.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">when he was about three years old</span>. On that day, Abraham prepared a large feast to celebrate. <a href="#GEN.21.9"><sup id="GEN.21.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>

So she said to Abraham, “Get rid of that slave woman from Egypt and her son! I do not want the son of that slave woman to be alone (OR, to be an heir along with) my son, Isaac!” <a href="#GEN.21.11"><sup id="GEN.21.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
Abraham was very distressed about the matter, because he was concerned about his son <span id="add-GEN.21.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Ishmael</span>. <a href="#GEN.21.12"><sup id="GEN.21.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
But God said to Abraham, “Do not be distressed about your son, Ishmael, and about your maidservant, Hagar. Do everything that Sarah tells you to do. Listen to her, because Isaac is the one who will be considered the ancestor of the descendants I promised to give you. <a href="#GEN.21.13"><sup id="GEN.21.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
But I will also cause the son of your maidservant to be the ancestor of the people of a great nation [MTY], because he is also your son.” <a href="#GEN.21.14"><sup id="GEN.21.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
So Abraham got up early the next morning. He got some food ready, put water in a container, and gave them to Hagar. He put them <span id="add-GEN.21.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in a bag</span> on her shoulder and sent them away.</p>

After they had drunk all the water in the container, she put her son under one of the bushes there. <a href="#GEN.21.16"><sup id="GEN.21.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
Then she went and sat nearby, about ◄as far as someone can shoot an arrow/100 meters away►, because she thought, “I cannot endure seeing my son die!” As she sat there, she began to cry <span id="add-GEN.21.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">loudly</span> [MTY]. <a href="#GEN.21.17"><sup id="GEN.21.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
<span id="add-GEN.21.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">The boy was crying too.</span> And God heard the boy crying.

Help your son up, and hold his hand as you leave, because I will cause his descendants to become a great nation.” <a href="#GEN.21.19"><sup id="GEN.21.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
Then God showed her a well of water. So she went to the well and filled the container with water, and gave the boy a drink.</p>
<p id="p-GEN.21.19" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.21.20"><sup id="GEN.21.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
God helped the boy as he grew up. He lived in the desert and became a good ◄archer/man who hunts with bow and arrows►. <a href="#GEN.21.21"><sup id="GEN.21.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>

At that time, <span id="add-GEN.21.22" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">King</span> Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, said to Abraham, “It is clear that God helps you with everything that you do. <a href="#GEN.21.23"><sup id="GEN.21.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>

So Abraham brought some sheep and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them made a ◄treaty/peace agreement►. <a href="#GEN.21.28"><sup id="GEN.21.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
Abraham separated seven female lambs from his flock. <a href="#GEN.21.29"><sup id="GEN.21.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>

After they made the agreement at Beersheba, Abimelech and his army commander, Phicol, left, and returned to the land of the Philistine people-group. <a href="#GEN.21.33"><sup id="GEN.21.33" class="usx-v">33</sup></a>
Abraham planted a ◄tamarisk tree/kind of tree called esel► there, and he worshiped the eternal God there. <a href="#GEN.21.34"><sup id="GEN.21.34" class="usx-v">34</sup></a>

Then Abraham took the wood to kindle a fire for the burnt offering and placed it on his son Isaac, for him to carry.

Then Isaac spoke to his father Abraham, saying, “My father!” Abraham replied, “Yes, my son, I’m here!” Isaac said, “Look, we have wood and <span id="add-GEN.22.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">coals to light</span> a fire, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?” <a href="#GEN.22.8"><sup id="GEN.22.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>

Then Abraham stood up and bowed <span id="add-GEN.23.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in respect</span> in front of the people who owned the land, the descendants of Heth. <a href="#GEN.23.8"><sup id="GEN.23.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
He said to them, “If you say that you are willing for me to bury my wife’s body here, listen to me, and ask Ephron, the son of Zohar for me, <a href="#GEN.23.9"><sup id="GEN.23.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
to sell to me the cave in the Machpelah area, which is at the end of his field. Ask him to sell it to me for the full price he wants, so that I can have a burial ground among you.” <a href="#GEN.23.10"><sup id="GEN.23.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
Ephron was sitting among the people near the city gate where many [HYP] descendants of Heth had gathered. He heard what Abraham said to them. <a href="#GEN.23.11"><sup id="GEN.23.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
<span id="add-GEN.23.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">So, just to make the customary reply to start the real discussion about a price</span>, Ephron said, “No, sir, listen to me. I will give to you the field and the cave in it, without charge, with the people here as witnesses.” <a href="#GEN.23.12"><sup id="GEN.23.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
Abraham again bowed before the people who lived in the area, <a href="#GEN.23.13"><sup id="GEN.23.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
and said to Ephron, as all the others were listening, “<span id="add-GEN.23.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">No</span>, listen to me. If you are willing, I will pay for the field. You tell me what the price is, and I will give it to you. If you accept it, the field will become mine, and I can bury my wife’s body there.” <a href="#GEN.23.14"><sup id="GEN.23.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him, <a href="#GEN.23.15"><sup id="GEN.23.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
“Sir, listen to me. The land is worth 400 pieces of silver. But the price is not important to you and me. Give me the money and bury your wife’s body there.” <a href="#GEN.23.16"><sup id="GEN.23.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
Abraham agreed with Ephron about the price, and weighed for Ephron the 400 pieces of silver he had suggested, as everyone was listening, using the standard weights for silver used <span id="add-GEN.23.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in that area</span> by people who sold things.</p>
<p id="p-GEN.23.16" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.23.17"><sup id="GEN.23.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
So Ephron’s field in the Machpelah area, near Mamre, and the cave in the field, and all the trees that were in the field inside the boundaries of the land, became Abraham’s possession. <a href="#GEN.23.18"><sup id="GEN.23.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
It became Abraham’s property as all the descendants of Heth were listening there at the city gate. <a href="#GEN.23.19"><sup id="GEN.23.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
After that, Abraham buried his wife Sarah’s body in the cave in the field in the Machpelah area near Mamre, which is now called Hebron <span id="add-GEN.23.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">city</span>, in the Canaan region. <a href="#GEN.23.20"><sup id="GEN.23.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
So the field and the cave in it were officially sold to Abraham by the descendants of Heth, to be used as a burial ground.</p>

Abraham was now a very old man. Yahweh had blessed Abraham in many ways. <a href="#GEN.24.2"><sup id="GEN.24.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>

Instead, go back to my country and to my relatives and get a wife for my son Isaac from among them.” <a href="#GEN.24.5"><sup id="GEN.24.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
The servant asked him, “If I find a woman among your relatives, what if she is not willing to come back with me to this land? Shall I take your son back there to the country you came from, <span id="add-GEN.24.5" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">so he can find a wife and live there</span>?” <a href="#GEN.24.6"><sup id="GEN.24.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
Abraham replied to him, “No! Be certain that you don’t take my son there! <a href="#GEN.24.7"><sup id="GEN.24.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Yahweh God, who created the heavens, brought me here. He brought me from my father’s household, and from the land where my relatives lived.

But if the woman you find will not come back with you, you are free to disregard the promise you are making. The only thing that you must not do is to take my son to live there!” <a href="#GEN.24.9"><sup id="GEN.24.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
So the servant put his hand between Abraham’s thighs and made a solemn promise about the matter.</p>
<p id="s1-GEN.24.9" class="usx-s1" >Abraham’s servant found a wife for Isaac</p>

Then the servant took ten of his master’s camels and loaded them with all kinds of goods that his master gave him to take along. Then he left to go to Aram-Naharaim, <span id="add-GEN.24.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">which is in ◄northern Mesopotamia/Syria►</span>. He arrived in Nahor city. <a href="#GEN.24.11"><sup id="GEN.24.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
It was late in the afternoon, at the time when the women go to the well to get water, when he arrived there. He made the camels kneel down near the well, which was outside the city. <a href="#GEN.24.12"><sup id="GEN.24.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
The servant prayed, “Yahweh God whom my master Abraham worships, enable me to be successful today! Act kindly to my master, Abraham! <a href="#GEN.24.13"><sup id="GEN.24.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Listen to me. I am standing near a well of water, and the young women of the city are coming to get water. <a href="#GEN.24.14"><sup id="GEN.24.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
I am asking you this: ‘I will say to some girl, “Please lower your jar so that I may drink some water.” If she says, “Drink some, and I will draw some water <span id="add-GEN.24.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">from the well</span> for your camels, too,” I will know that she is the woman whom you chose to be a wife for your servant, Isaac, and I will know that you have been kind to my master.’” <a href="#GEN.24.15"><sup id="GEN.24.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
Before he finished praying, <span id="add-GEN.24.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">amazingly</span>, Rebekah arrived there, carrying a jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel, who was the son of Milcah, the wife of Abraham’s younger brother Nahor. <a href="#GEN.24.16"><sup id="GEN.24.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
She was very beautiful and still a virgin. She went down to the edge of the well, filled her jar with water, and then came back up. <a href="#GEN.24.17"><sup id="GEN.24.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
Abraham’s servant immediately ran to meet her, and said, “Please give me a little water from your jar.” <a href="#GEN.24.18"><sup id="GEN.24.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
She replied, “Drink some, sir!” She lowered her jar from her shoulder to her hands and gave him a drink. <a href="#GEN.24.19"><sup id="GEN.24.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
After she had finished giving him a drink, she said, “I will also get some water for your camels, until they have had enough to drink.” <a href="#GEN.24.20"><sup id="GEN.24.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
She quickly emptied the water in her jar into the trough <span id="add-GEN.24.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">for giving water to animals</span>, and then ran back to the well, and kept getting water for all the camels. <a href="#GEN.24.21"><sup id="GEN.24.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
The servant just watched her, without saying anything. He wanted to know if Yahweh had caused his trip to be successful or not. <a href="#GEN.24.22"><sup id="GEN.24.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
Finally, after the camels finished drinking, the servant took out a gold nose ring that weighed ◄two ounces/6 grams►, and two large gold bracelets for her arms, and gave them to Rebekah <span id="add-GEN.24.22" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and told her to put them on</span>. <a href="#GEN.24.23"><sup id="GEN.24.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
Then he said, “Tell me whose daughter you are. Also, tell me, is there room in your father’s house for me and my men to sleep there tonight?” <a href="#GEN.24.24"><sup id="GEN.24.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
She replied, “My father’s name is Bethuel. He is the son of Nahor and his wife Milcah. <a href="#GEN.24.25"><sup id="GEN.24.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
Yes, we have room where you all can sleep tonight, and we also have plenty of straw and grain to feed the camels.” <a href="#GEN.24.26"><sup id="GEN.24.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
The servant bowed and worshiped Yahweh. <a href="#GEN.24.27"><sup id="GEN.24.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
He said, “I thank you, Yahweh God, whom my master Abraham worships. You have continued to be kind and faithful to my master. You led me on this journey straight/directly to the house of my master’s relatives!” <a href="#GEN.24.28"><sup id="GEN.24.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
The girl ran and told everyone in her mother’s household about what had happened. <a href="#GEN.24.29"><sup id="GEN.24.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>
Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban. Laban went quickly to Abraham’s servant, who was still by the well. <a href="#GEN.24.30"><sup id="GEN.24.30" class="usx-v">30</sup></a>
He was surprised to have seen the bracelets on his sister’s arms and the nose ring and to have heard Rebekah tell what the man had said to her. So he went out and saw the man standing near the camels, close to the well. <a href="#GEN.24.31"><sup id="GEN.24.31" class="usx-v">31</sup></a>
He said to the man, “You who have been blessed by Yahweh, come with me! ◄Why are standing out here?/You should not keep standing out here!► [RHQ] I have prepared a room for you in the house, and a place for the camels to stay.” <a href="#GEN.24.32"><sup id="GEN.24.32" class="usx-v">32</sup></a>
So the servant went to the house, and Laban’s servants unloaded the camels, and brought straw and grain for the camels, and water for him and the men with him to wash their feet. <a href="#GEN.24.33"><sup id="GEN.24.33" class="usx-v">33</sup></a>
They set food in front of him for him to eat, but he said, “I will not eat until I tell you ◄what I need to tell you/why I have come►.” So Laban said, “Tell us!” <a href="#GEN.24.34"><sup id="GEN.24.34" class="usx-v">34</sup></a>
So the servant said, “I am Abraham’s servant. <a href="#GEN.24.35"><sup id="GEN.24.35" class="usx-v">35</sup></a>
Yahweh has greatly blessed my master so that he has become very rich. Yahweh has given him many sheep and cattle, a lot of gold and silver, male and female servants, camels and donkeys. <a href="#GEN.24.36"><sup id="GEN.24.36" class="usx-v">36</sup></a>
My master’s wife, Sarah, bore a son for him when she was very old, and my master has given to his son everything he owns. <a href="#GEN.24.37"><sup id="GEN.24.37" class="usx-v">37</sup></a>
My master made me solemnly promise, saying, ‘Do not get a wife for my son from the women here in Canaan. <a href="#GEN.24.38"><sup id="GEN.24.38" class="usx-v">38</sup></a>
Instead, go back to my father’s family, to my own clan, and get from them a wife for my son.’ <a href="#GEN.24.39"><sup id="GEN.24.39" class="usx-v">39</sup></a>
Then I asked my master, ‘What shall I do if the woman you show me will not come back with me?’ <a href="#GEN.24.40"><sup id="GEN.24.40" class="usx-v">40</sup></a>
He replied, ‘Yahweh, whom I have always obeyed [MTY], will send his angel with you, and he will cause your journey to be successful, with the result that you can get a wife for my son from my clan, from my father’s family. <a href="#GEN.24.41"><sup id="GEN.24.41" class="usx-v">41</sup></a>
But if my clan refuses to allow her to return with you, you will be freed from being cursed because of not obeying me.’</p>

    <a href="#GEN.24.42"><sup id="GEN.24.42" class="usx-v">42</sup></a>
“When I came today to the well, I prayed, ‘Yahweh God whom my master, Abraham worships, if you are willing, please allow this journey of mine to be successful. <a href="#GEN.24.43"><sup id="GEN.24.43" class="usx-v">43</sup></a>

Before I finished praying, <span id="add-GEN.24.45" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">amazingly</span>, Rebekah approached with her water jar on her shoulder.

Then I bowed and worshiped Yahweh, and I thanked Yahweh God, the one my master Abraham worships, the one who led me on the right road to get the granddaughter of my master’s brother to be a wife for my master’s son. <a href="#GEN.24.49"><sup id="GEN.24.49" class="usx-v">49</sup></a>
Now, if you are kind and faithful to my master, tell me that you will do what I am asking. If you will not do that, tell me that also, so I may know what to do [MTY].” <a href="#GEN.24.50"><sup id="GEN.24.50" class="usx-v">50</sup></a>
Laban and Bethuel answered, “It is clear that Yahweh has caused this to happen. So we two cannot say anything more. <a href="#GEN.24.51"><sup id="GEN.24.51" class="usx-v">51</sup></a>

Then they ate a meal together. The men who were with Abraham’s servant also slept there that night. The next morning, the servant said, “Allow me now to return to my master.” <a href="#GEN.24.55"><sup id="GEN.24.55" class="usx-v">55</sup></a>

These are their names, in the order in which they were born: Ishmael’s oldest son was named Nebaioth. After him were born Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, <a href="#GEN.25.14"><sup id="GEN.25.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
Mishma, Dumah, Massa, <a href="#GEN.25.15"><sup id="GEN.25.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>

Ishmael lived until he was 137 years old. Then he died, [EUP] joining his ancestors who had previously died. <a href="#GEN.25.18"><sup id="GEN.25.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
His descendants ◄settled/went to live► in the area between Shur and Havilah, near the border of Egypt as a person travels toward Asshur. All of their camps were close to each other (OR, they all frequently attacked each other).</p>

◄This is an account of/I will now tell you about► Abraham’s son, Isaac. Abraham became the father of Isaac, <a href="#GEN.25.20"><sup id="GEN.25.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
and when Isaac was 40 years old, he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel. Bethuel was one of the descendants of Aram from Paddan-Aram. Rebekah was the sister of Laban, who belonged to the Aram people-group. <a href="#GEN.25.21"><sup id="GEN.25.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
Almost 20 years after they were married, Rebekah still had no children. So Isaac prayed to Yahweh concerning his wife, and Yahweh answered his prayer. His wife Rebekah became pregnant. <a href="#GEN.25.22"><sup id="GEN.25.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
She was carrying twins in her womb, and they kept jostling each other. So she said, “Why is it <span id="add-GEN.25.22" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that this is happening to me</span>?” So she asked Yahweh about it. <a href="#GEN.25.23"><sup id="GEN.25.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
Yahweh said to her, “The older one of your twins will serve the younger one. The twins will be ancestors of two nations. And those two people-groups will separate from each other.” [CHI]</p>

    <a href="#GEN.25.24"><sup id="GEN.25.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
When Rebekah gave birth, it was true! Twin boys were born! <a href="#GEN.25.25"><sup id="GEN.25.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
The first one born was red, and his body had hair all over it, like a garment made of hair. So they named him Esau, <span id="add-GEN.25.25" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">which sounds like the Hebrew word that means ‘hairy&#39;</span>. <a href="#GEN.25.26"><sup id="GEN.25.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
Then his brother was born, grasping Esau’s heel. So they named him Jacob, <span id="add-GEN.25.26" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">which sounds like the Hebrew word that means ‘heel’</span>. Isaac was 60 years old when the twins were born.</p>

    <a href="#GEN.25.27"><sup id="GEN.25.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
When the boys grew up, Esau became a skilled hunter. He spent a lot of time out in the fields. Jacob was a quiet man who stayed close to the campsite. <a href="#GEN.25.28"><sup id="GEN.25.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
Isaac liked Esau more, because he enjoyed the taste of the meat of the animals that Esau killed. But Rebekah liked Jacob more.</p>

    <a href="#GEN.25.29"><sup id="GEN.25.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>
One day while Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came home from the field, very hungry. <a href="#GEN.25.30"><sup id="GEN.25.30" class="usx-v">30</sup></a>
He said to Jacob, “Give me some of that red stew to eat right now, because I am very hungry!” [That is why Esau’s other name was Edom, <span id="add-GEN.25.30" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">which sounds like the Hebrew word that means ‘red</span>’.] <a href="#GEN.25.31"><sup id="GEN.25.31" class="usx-v">31</sup></a>

Esau replied, “Well, I am about to die <span id="add-GEN.25.32" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">from being so hungry</span>. <span id="add-GEN.25.32" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">If I die now</span>, ◄my birthright will not benefit me./What good will my birthright be to me?►” [RHQ] <a href="#GEN.25.33"><sup id="GEN.25.33" class="usx-v">33</sup></a>
Jacob said, “◄Swear to/Solemnly promise► me that you are giving me the privileges that you will have from being the firstborn son!” So that is what Esau did. He sold his birthright to Jacob. <a href="#GEN.25.34"><sup id="GEN.25.34" class="usx-v">34</sup></a>
Then Jacob gave to Esau some bread and some stew made of lentils/beans. Esau ate and drank, and then he got up and left. By doing that, Esau showed that he ◄was not interested in/did not value► the privileges that would be his because of being the firstborn son.</p>

Some time later there was a severe ◄famine/scarcity of food► there. That was different from the famine that occurred when Abraham was alive.

Stay in this land for a while, and I will help you and bless you, because it is to you and your descendants that I will give all these lands, and I will do what I solemnly promised to your father. <a href="#GEN.26.4"><sup id="GEN.26.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
I will cause your descendants to be as numerous as the stars in the sky. I will give to your descendants all these lands, and I will cause your descendants to be a blessing to the people of [MTY] all nations on the earth. <a href="#GEN.26.5"><sup id="GEN.26.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>

<p id="p-GEN.26.5" class="usx-p" >So Isaac <span id="add-GEN.26.5" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">went and asked King Abimelech if he would permit him to live in the Gerar area.

<span id="add-GEN.26.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">so Isaac</span> stayed there <span id="add-GEN.26.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">along with his wife and sons</span>.</p>
<p id="p-GEN.26.6" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.26.7"><sup id="GEN.26.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
When the men in Gerar <span id="add-GEN.26.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">town</span> asked who Rebekah was, Isaac said, “She is my sister.” He said that because he was afraid to say, “She is my wife.” He thought, “Rebekah is very beautiful, so they will want her. <span id="add-GEN.26.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">If I say that she is my sister, they know they will have to negotiate about a bride price because I am her older brother; but if I say that she is my wife, no negotiation will be possible</span>.

When Isaac had been there a long time, one day Abimelech, the king of the Philistine people-group, looked down from a window <span id="add-GEN.26.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in his palace</span> and was surprised to see Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah. <a href="#GEN.26.9"><sup id="GEN.26.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
So Abimelech summoned Isaac and said to him, “Now I realize that she is really your wife! So why did you say, ‘She is my sister’?” Isaac replied to him, “I said that because I thought that someone here might kill me to get her.” <a href="#GEN.26.10"><sup id="GEN.26.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
Abimelech said, “◄You should not have done this to us!/Why did you do this?► [RHQ] One of our people might have ◄had sex with/slept with► [EUP] your wife, and you would have caused us to be guilty of a great sin!” <a href="#GEN.26.11"><sup id="GEN.26.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
Then Abimelech commanded all his people, saying, “Do not harm/molest this man or his wife! Anyone who does that will surely be executed!”</p>
<p id="s1-GEN.26.11" class="usx-s1" >The Philistines argued with Isaac about wells</p>

    <a href="#GEN.26.12"><sup id="GEN.26.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
Isaac planted grain in that land that year, and he harvested a very large crop, because Yahweh blessed him. <a href="#GEN.26.13"><sup id="GEN.26.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Isaac continued to acquire more and more possessions, until finally he became very wealthy. <a href="#GEN.26.14"><sup id="GEN.26.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
He had large herds of sheep and goats and cattle, and many slaves. Because of that, the Philistine people envied him. <a href="#GEN.26.15"><sup id="GEN.26.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
So all the wells that the servants of his father Abraham had dug during the time when he was alive, the people filled up with dirt. <a href="#GEN.26.16"><sup id="GEN.26.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
Then Abimelech said to Isaac, “You people have become more numerous than we are, so I want you to get out of our area.” <a href="#GEN.26.17"><sup id="GEN.26.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
So Isaac <span id="add-GEN.26.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and his family</span> moved from there. They set up their tents in Gerar Valley <span id="add-GEN.26.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and started to live there</span>. <a href="#GEN.26.18"><sup id="GEN.26.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
There were several wells in that area that had been dug when Isaac’s father Abraham was living, but Philistine people had filled them up <span id="add-GEN.26.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">with dirt</span> after Abraham died. Now Isaac and his servants removed the dirt, and Isaac gave the wells the same names that his father had given to them. <a href="#GEN.26.19"><sup id="GEN.26.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and discovered a well of fresh water. <a href="#GEN.26.20"><sup id="GEN.26.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
But other men who lived in Gerar <span id="add-GEN.26.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Valley</span> who took care of their animals argued/quarreled with the men who took care of Isaac’s animals, and said, “The water in this well is ours!” So Isaac named the well Esek, which means ‘dispute’, because they disputed about who owned it. <a href="#GEN.26.21"><sup id="GEN.26.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
Then Isaac’s servants dug another well, but they quarreled about who owned that one also. So Isaac named it Sitnah, <span id="add-GEN.26.21" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">which means ‘opposition</span>’. <a href="#GEN.26.22"><sup id="GEN.26.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
They moved on from there and dug another well, but this time no one quarreled about who owned it. So Isaac named it Rehoboth, <span id="add-GEN.26.22" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">which means ‘uninhabited place’</span>, saying, “Yahweh has given us an uninhabited place to live in, a place that is not wanted by other people, and we will become very prosperous here.”</p>

    <a href="#GEN.26.23"><sup id="GEN.26.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
From there Isaac went up to Beersheba. <a href="#GEN.26.24"><sup id="GEN.26.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
The first night that he was there, Yahweh appeared to him and said, “I am God, whom your father Abraham worshiped. Do not be afraid of anything.

So Isaac built a stone altar there <span id="add-GEN.26.25" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and offered a sacrifice</span> to worship Yahweh. He <span id="add-GEN.26.25" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and his servants</span> set up their tents there, and his servants started to dig a well.</p>

Isaac asked them, “You ◄acted in a hostile way toward me/treated me like an enemy► before, and sent me away. So why have you come to me now?” <a href="#GEN.26.28"><sup id="GEN.26.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
One of them answered, “We have seen that Yahweh helps you. So we said to each other, ‘We should have an agreement between us and you. We should make a peace treaty with you, <a href="#GEN.26.29"><sup id="GEN.26.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>

But first Isaac asked, “Are you really my son Esau?” Jacob replied, “Yes, I am.” <a href="#GEN.27.25"><sup id="GEN.27.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
Isaac said, “My son, bring me some of the meat that you have cooked, so that I may eat it and then give you my blessing.” So Jacob brought him some, and he ate it. Jacob also brought him some wine, and he drank it. <a href="#GEN.27.26"><sup id="GEN.27.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
Then Isaac said to him, “My son, come here and kiss me.” <a href="#GEN.27.27"><sup id="GEN.27.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
So Jacob came close to him, and his father kissed him on the cheek. Isaac smelled the clothes Jacob was wearing. They smelled like Esau’s clothes. So he said,</p>
<p id="q1-GEN.27.27" class="usx-q1" >“Truly, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that Yahweh has blessed.</p>

    <a href="#GEN.27.30"><sup id="GEN.27.30" class="usx-v">30</sup></a>
After Isaac finished blessing Jacob, Jacob was just leaving the room where his father was, when his older brother, Esau, returned from hunting. <a href="#GEN.27.31"><sup id="GEN.27.31" class="usx-v">31</sup></a>
Esau cooked some tasty meat and brought it to his father. He said to his father, “My father, please sit up and eat some of the meat that I have cooked, so that you can then give me your blessing!” <a href="#GEN.27.32"><sup id="GEN.27.32" class="usx-v">32</sup></a>
His father, Isaac, said to him, “Who are you?” He answered, “I am Esau, your firstborn son!” <a href="#GEN.27.33"><sup id="GEN.27.33" class="usx-v">33</sup></a>
Then Isaac, realizing that it was not Esau who had come earlier, trembled very violently. He said, “Then who is it that brought me some meat from an animal that he had hunted and killed, and I ate it all? He was here just before you came. I blessed him, and I cannot ◄take back that blessing/declare that those things will not happen to him►.” <a href="#GEN.27.34"><sup id="GEN.27.34" class="usx-v">34</sup></a>
When Esau heard those words of his father, he cried loudly. He was very disappointed. He said to his father, “My father, bless me, too!” <a href="#GEN.27.35"><sup id="GEN.27.35" class="usx-v">35</sup></a>
But his father said, “Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing!” <a href="#GEN.27.36"><sup id="GEN.27.36" class="usx-v">36</sup></a>
Esau said, “It is right [RHQ] that his name is Jacob, which means ‘cheat,’ because he deceived me two times. The first time he took my rights from being his firstborn son, and this time he took my blessing!” Then he asked, “Do you not have any blessing left for me?” <a href="#GEN.27.37"><sup id="GEN.27.37" class="usx-v">37</sup></a>
Isaac answered and said to Esau, “I have declared that your younger brother will rule over you, and declared that all his relatives will serve him. And I have said that God will give him plenty of grain and grapes for wine. So, my son, ◄what can I do for you?/There is nothing more that I can do for you!►” [RHQ] <a href="#GEN.27.38"><sup id="GEN.27.38" class="usx-v">38</sup></a>
Esau said to his father, “My father, do you have only one blessing? My father, bless me, too!” Then Esau cried very loudly. <a href="#GEN.27.39"><sup id="GEN.27.39" class="usx-v">39</sup></a>
His father Isaac answered and said to him,</p>
<p id="q1-GEN.27.39" class="usx-q1" >“The place where you will live will be far from the fertile soil and from the dew that God sends from heaven <span id="add-GEN.27.39" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to water the fields</span>.</p>

<p id="s1-GEN.27.40" class="usx-s1" >Jacob fled from Esau</p>
<p id="p-GEN.27.40" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.27.41"><sup id="GEN.27.41" class="usx-v">41</sup></a>
So, because his father had given a blessing to Jacob, and not to him, Esau hated his younger brother. Esau thought to himself, “After my father dies and we finish mourning for him, I will kill Jacob!” <a href="#GEN.27.42"><sup id="GEN.27.42" class="usx-v">42</sup></a>
But Rebekah found out what her older son, Esau, was thinking. So she summoned her younger son, Jacob, and said to him, “Listen to me.

So now, my son, listen carefully to what I am telling you. Escape quickly and go and stay with my brother Laban, in Haran <span id="add-GEN.27.43" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">town</span>. <a href="#GEN.27.44"><sup id="GEN.27.44" class="usx-v">44</sup></a>
Stay with him a while, until your older brother is no longer angry. <a href="#GEN.27.45"><sup id="GEN.27.45" class="usx-v">45</sup></a>
When he forgets what you did to him, I will send a message to you, to tell you to return from there.

<p id="p-GEN.27.45" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.27.46"><sup id="GEN.27.46" class="usx-v">46</sup></a>
Rebekah also said to Isaac, “These <span id="add-GEN.27.46" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">foreign</span> women whom Esau has married, who are descendants of Heth, are making my life miserable. I would prefer to die than to see Jacob marry a woman from the descendants of Heth in this area!”</p>
<a href="#GEN.28"><h3 id="GEN.28" class="usx-c">28</h3></a>
<p id="s1-GEN.28" class="usx-s1" >Isaac gave instructions to Jacob</p>
<p id="p-GEN.28" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.28.1"><sup id="GEN.28.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
Then Isaac summoned Jacob, and gave him a blessing. He told him, “Do not marry a woman of the Canaan people-group. <a href="#GEN.28.2"><sup id="GEN.28.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
Instead, go right away to Paddan-Aram <span id="add-GEN.28.2" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in northwest Mesopotamia</span>, to the house of your mother’s father Bethuel. Ask one of the daughters of your mother’s brother Laban to marry you. <a href="#GEN.28.3"><sup id="GEN.28.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
I will pray that God Almighty will bless you, and enable you to <span id="add-GEN.28.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">get married and</span> have many descendants, in order that they will become many people-groups. <a href="#GEN.28.4"><sup id="GEN.28.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
I also will pray that he will bless you and your descendants by enabling you to possess/seize the land in which you are now living as a foreigner, the land that God promised to give to <span id="add-GEN.28.4" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">my father</span> Abraham and his descendants.” <a href="#GEN.28.5"><sup id="GEN.28.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
So Isaac sent Jacob to Paddan-Aram, to live with Rebekah’s brother Laban, the son of Bethuel, who belonged to the Aram people-group.</p>
<p id="s1-GEN.28.5" class="usx-s1" >Esau married Ishmael’s daughter</p>

    <a href="#GEN.28.6"><sup id="GEN.28.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
Esau found out that his father Isaac had blessed Jacob and then sent him to Paddan-Aram. He also found out that when he blessed Isaac, he told him, “Do not marry a woman of the Canaan people-group,” <a href="#GEN.28.7"><sup id="GEN.28.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
and that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother, and had gone to Paddan-Aram. <a href="#GEN.28.8"><sup id="GEN.28.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
Esau also realized that his father Isaac did not approve of women from the Canaan people-group. <a href="#GEN.28.9"><sup id="GEN.28.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
Because of that, Esau went to see his uncle Ishmael, and married Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael. Mahalath was the sister of Nabaioth and the granddaughter of Abraham.</p>
<p id="s1-GEN.28.9" class="usx-s1" >God made a promise to Jacob in a dream</p>

    <a href="#GEN.28.10"><sup id="GEN.28.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
Meanwhile, Jacob left Beersheba and started walking along the road to Haran. <a href="#GEN.28.11"><sup id="GEN.28.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
When he arrived at a certain place, he stopped there, because the sun had gone down. He took one of the stones there and put it under his head to use as a pillow. Then he lay down and slept there. <a href="#GEN.28.12"><sup id="GEN.28.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
While he was sleeping, he had a dream, in which he <span id="add-GEN.28.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">was surprised to</span> see a stairway. The bottom of the stairway was on the earth and the top was in the sky. Jacob also saw that God’s angels were going up and down the stairway. <a href="#GEN.28.13"><sup id="GEN.28.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
And he <span id="add-GEN.28.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">was surprised to</span> see Yahweh standing at the top of the stairway, saying “I am Yahweh God, whom your grandfather Abraham worshiped, and whom Isaac worships. I will give to you and to your descendants the land on which you are lying. <a href="#GEN.28.14"><sup id="GEN.28.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
Your descendants will be as numerous as the particles of dirt that are on the earth, and their territory will be very large.

I will help you and protect you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you; I will continue to do for you all that I have promised to do.”</p>
<p id="p-GEN.28.15" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.28.16"><sup id="GEN.28.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>

    <span id="add-GEN.28.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">During the night</span>, when Jacob woke up from sleeping, he thought, “Surely Yahweh is in this place, and until now I was not aware of it!” <a href="#GEN.28.17"><sup id="GEN.28.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
He was afraid, and he said, “This place is very awesome! This is surely the place where God lives, and this is the entrance to heaven!” <a href="#GEN.28.18"><sup id="GEN.28.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
In the morning Jacob got up and took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up on its end to show that the place was a holy place.

He named that place Bethel, <span id="add-GEN.28.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">which means ‘house of God’.</span> Previously its name was Luz.</p>

    <a href="#GEN.28.20"><sup id="GEN.28.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>

When all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would work together to roll the stone away from the top of the well and get water for the sheep. When they finished doing that, they would put the stone back in its place over the top of the well.</p>

They replied, “No, we cannot do that until all the flocks are gathered here and the stone is removed from the top of the well. After that, we will give water to the sheep.”</p>

Jacob told Rachel that he was one of her father’s relatives, the son of her aunt Rebekah. So she ran and told that to her father.</p>
<p id="p-GEN.29.12" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.29.13"><sup id="GEN.29.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
As soon as Laban heard that Jacob, his sister’s son, was there, he ran to meet him.

Then he brought him to his home, and Jacob told him all that had happened to him. <a href="#GEN.29.14"><sup id="GEN.29.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
Then Laban said to him, “Truly, you are part of my family!”</p>

Laban said to him “◄You should not work for me for nothing just because you are a relative of mine!/Why should you work for me for nothing just because you are a relative of mine?► [RHQ] Tell me how much you want me to pay you.” <a href="#GEN.29.16"><sup id="GEN.29.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
Well, Laban had two daughters. The older one was named Leah, and the younger one was named Rachel. <a href="#GEN.29.17"><sup id="GEN.29.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
Leah had pretty eyes, but Rachel had a very attractive figure and was beautiful. <a href="#GEN.29.18"><sup id="GEN.29.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
Jacob ◄was in love with/wanted very much to be married to► Rachel, and he said, “I will work for you for seven years. That will be my payment for your letting me marry your younger daughter, Rachel.” <a href="#GEN.29.19"><sup id="GEN.29.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
Laban replied, “It is better for me to let you marry her than for her to marry some other man!” <a href="#GEN.29.20"><sup id="GEN.29.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
So Jacob worked for Laban for seven years to get Rachel, but to him it seemed like it was only a few days, because he loved her so much.</p>
<p id="p-GEN.29.20" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.29.21"><sup id="GEN.29.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
After the seven years were ended, Jacob said to Laban, “Let me marry Rachel now, because the time we agreed upon for me to work for you is ended, and I want to marry her. [EUP]” <a href="#GEN.29.22"><sup id="GEN.29.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
So Laban gathered together all the people who lived in that area and made a feast. <a href="#GEN.29.23"><sup id="GEN.29.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
But that evening, instead of taking Rachel to Jacob, Laban took his older daughter, Leah, to him. But because it was already dark, he could not see that it was Leah and not Rachel, and he had sex [EUP] with her. <a href="#GEN.29.24"><sup id="GEN.29.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
(Laban had already given his slave girl Zilpah to his daughter Leah to be her maid/servant.)</p>

    <a href="#GEN.29.25"><sup id="GEN.29.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
The next morning, Jacob was shocked to see that it was Leah who was with him!

Laban replied, “In this land, it is not our custom to give a younger daughter to be married before we let someone marry our firstborn daughter. <a href="#GEN.29.27"><sup id="GEN.29.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
After we finish this week of celebration, we will let you marry the younger one also. But in return, you must pay for Rachel by working for me for another seven years.”</p>

    <a href="#GEN.29.28"><sup id="GEN.29.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>

Laban gave his slave girl, Bilhah, to Rachel to be her maid/servant. <a href="#GEN.29.30"><sup id="GEN.29.30" class="usx-v">30</sup></a>
Jacob had sex [EUP] with Rachel also, and he loved Rachel more than he loved Leah. And Jacob worked for Laban for another seven years.</p>

Leah gave birth to a son, whom she named Reuben, <span id="add-GEN.29.32" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">which sounds like the Hebrew words that mean ‘Look, a son</span>!’ She said, “Yahweh has seen that I was miserable, and because of that he has given me a son.

Later she became pregnant again and gave birth to another son.

Rachel realized that she was not becoming pregnant and giving birth to any children for Jacob. So she became jealous of her older sister, Leah, because Leah had given birth to four sons.

She became pregnant and bore Jacob a son. <a href="#GEN.30.6"><sup id="GEN.30.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
Rachel said, “God has ◄vindicated me/judged my case and has decided that what I have done is right►.

God answered Leah’s prayers, and she became pregnant and bore a fifth son to Jacob. <a href="#GEN.30.18"><sup id="GEN.30.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
Leah said, “God has rewarded me for giving my slave to my husband to be another wife for him.” So she named him Issachar, <span id="add-GEN.30.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">which sounds like the Hebrew word that means ‘reward’</span>.</p>

After Rachel had given birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Now allow me to quit working for you and let me return to my own land. <a href="#GEN.30.26"><sup id="GEN.30.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
You know the work that I have done for you <span id="add-GEN.30.26" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">for a long time to get my wives</span>. So let me take my wives and my children, and leave.” <a href="#GEN.30.27"><sup id="GEN.30.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
But Laban said to him, “If you are pleased with me, stay here, because I have found out by performing a magic ritual that Yahweh has blessed me because of what you have done for me. <a href="#GEN.30.28"><sup id="GEN.30.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
Tell me what you want me to pay you for continuing to work for me, and that is what I will pay you.” <a href="#GEN.30.29"><sup id="GEN.30.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>
Jacob replied, “You know how I have worked for you, and you know that your livestock have increased greatly as I have taken care of them. <a href="#GEN.30.30"><sup id="GEN.30.30" class="usx-v">30</sup></a>
You had only a few animals before I came here. But now you have very many, and Yahweh has caused them to increase greatly in number wherever I have taken them. But now I need to start taking care of the needs of my own family.” <a href="#GEN.30.31"><sup id="GEN.30.31" class="usx-v">31</sup></a>
Laban replied, “What do you want me to give you?” Jacob replied, “I do not want you to pay me anything. But if you will do this one thing for me, I will continue to take care of your flocks and protect them. <a href="#GEN.30.32"><sup id="GEN.30.32" class="usx-v">32</sup></a>
Allow me to go and look at all of your flocks today and remove from them all the speckled sheep, all the spotted sheep, and every dark-colored lamb, all the goats that are speckled, and all the goats that are spotted, <span id="add-GEN.30.32" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and keep them for myself</span>. They will be my wages. <a href="#GEN.30.33"><sup id="GEN.30.33" class="usx-v">33</sup></a>
In that way, in the future, you will be able to know whether I have been honest regarding what you have paid me. If any of my goats are neither speckled or spotted, or if any of my lambs are not dark-colored, you will know that I have stolen them from you.”</p>
<p id="p-GEN.30.33" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.30.34"><sup id="GEN.30.34" class="usx-v">34</sup></a>
Laban agreed and said, “Okay, we will do as you have said.” <a href="#GEN.30.35"><sup id="GEN.30.35" class="usx-v">35</sup></a>
But that same day Laban removed all the male goats that had black and white stripes on them or were spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled or spotted, all the goats that were partly white, and all the dark-colored lambs. He separated them and told his sons to take care of them. <a href="#GEN.30.36"><sup id="GEN.30.36" class="usx-v">36</sup></a>
Then he took these flocks and walked a distance of three days, in order that he could be that far from Jacob. Jacob continued to take care of the rest of Laban’s flocks.</p>
<p id="p-GEN.30.36" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.30.37"><sup id="GEN.30.37" class="usx-v">37</sup></a>
Then Jacob cut some branches of ◄poplar, almond, and plane trees/three kinds of trees that had white wood►. He peeled strips of bark from the branches, so that where the bark had been peeled off, the branches were light in color. <a href="#GEN.30.38"><sup id="GEN.30.38" class="usx-v">38</sup></a>
Then he placed the peeled branches in the troughs where they put the water for the animals to drink, so that the branches would be in front of the flocks when they came to drink. <a href="#GEN.30.39"><sup id="GEN.30.39" class="usx-v">39</sup></a>
The animals also mated in front of the branches, and eventually they gave birth to animals that were speckled, or to animals that were spotted, or to animals that had black and white stripes on them. <a href="#GEN.30.40"><sup id="GEN.30.40" class="usx-v">40</sup></a>
Furthermore, Jacob separated the female sheep in his flock from the other sheep and goats in Laban’s flock. And when his female sheep mated, he made them look toward the animals that belonged to Laban that had black and white stripes on them, and the dark-colored animals. He did that so that the female sheep would give birth to animals that were striped or dark-colored. By doing that, he made bigger flocks for himself, and he kept them separate from Laban’s flocks. <a href="#GEN.30.41"><sup id="GEN.30.41" class="usx-v">41</sup></a>
In addition, whenever the stronger female sheep were ready to mate, Jacob put some of those peeled branches in the troughs in front of them, so that they would mate in front of the branches. <a href="#GEN.30.42"><sup id="GEN.30.42" class="usx-v">42</sup></a>
But when weak animals were ready to mate, he did not put the branches in their troughs. So the weak ones became part of Laban’s flock, and the strong ones became part of Jacob’s flock. <a href="#GEN.30.43"><sup id="GEN.30.43" class="usx-v">43</sup></a>
As a result, Jacob became very rich. He owned many large flocks of sheep and goats, and many male and female slaves, and many camels and donkeys.</p>
<a href="#GEN.31"><h3 id="GEN.31" class="usx-c">31</h3></a>

And Jacob noticed that Laban was not acting friendly toward him as he had done before. <a href="#GEN.31.3"><sup id="GEN.31.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
Then Yahweh said to Jacob, “Go back to your country and your relatives, and I will help you there.”</p>
<p id="p-GEN.31.3" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.31.4"><sup id="GEN.31.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
So Jacob sent a message to Rachel and Leah, telling them to come out to the pastures where his flocks of sheep and goats were. <a href="#GEN.31.5"><sup id="GEN.31.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
When they arrived, he said to them, “I see that your father does not act friendly toward me as he did previously. But God, whom my father worshiped, has helped me. <a href="#GEN.31.6"><sup id="GEN.31.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>

When Laban said, ‘The speckled animals are the ones that I will give you to be your wages,’ then all the animals gave birth to young ones that were speckled.

Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and then into Leah’s tent, and then into the tents of the two female slaves and searched for the idols, but he did not find them. After he left their tents, he entered Rachel’s tent. <a href="#GEN.31.34"><sup id="GEN.31.34" class="usx-v">34</sup></a>
But Rachel had previously taken the idols and put them in the saddle of a camel, and she was sitting on the saddle. So when Laban searched all over for them inside Rachel’s tent, he did not find them. <a href="#GEN.31.35"><sup id="GEN.31.35" class="usx-v">35</sup></a>
Rachel said to her father, “Do not be angry with me, sir, but I cannot get up in your presence <span id="add-GEN.31.35" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to show respect for you</span>, because I am having my monthly menstrual period.

    <a href="#GEN.31.36"><sup id="GEN.31.36" class="usx-v">36</sup></a>
Then Jacob became angry. He rebuked Laban, saying, “What crime did I commit? For what sin that I committed have you pursued me? <a href="#GEN.31.37"><sup id="GEN.31.37" class="usx-v">37</sup></a>
Now you have searched through all my possessions, and what did you find from all these possessions that belongs to you? Put it here in front of my relatives and your relatives, so that they can decide who is right, you or me!</p>
<p id="p-GEN.31.37" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.31.38"><sup id="GEN.31.38" class="usx-v">38</sup></a>
I was with you for 20 years. In all that time, your sheep and goats have ◄not miscarried/always given birth to animals safely►. I have not <span id="add-GEN.31.38" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">killed and</span> eaten any rams from your flocks. <a href="#GEN.31.39"><sup id="GEN.31.39" class="usx-v">39</sup></a>
When one of your animals was attacked and mauled/killed by a wild animal, I did not bring it to you. I replaced the dead animal with a living one of my own animals. Whenever one of your animals was stolen, during the day or during the night, you demanded that I replace it with one of my own animals. <a href="#GEN.31.40"><sup id="GEN.31.40" class="usx-v">40</sup></a>
I suffered from the heat during the day and from the cold at night. I was often not even able to sleep [PRS]! <a href="#GEN.31.41"><sup id="GEN.31.41" class="usx-v">41</sup></a>
I lived in your household for 20 years. I worked for you for 14 years to buy your two daughters, and for six more years to buy some of your sheep and goats. During that time, you changed and reduced my wages many times [HYP]. <a href="#GEN.31.42"><sup id="GEN.31.42" class="usx-v">42</sup></a>
If God, the one whom my grandfather Abraham worshiped and before whom my father Isaac trembled in fear, had not been with me and helped me, you would have sent me away ◄with nothing in my hands/owning nothing►! But God saw how much I was suffering and how hard I was working, so last night he told you that what you have done to me was wrong.”</p>
<p id="s1-GEN.31.42" class="usx-s1" >Jacob and Laban made a solemn promise not to harm each other</p>
<p id="p-GEN.31.42" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.31.43"><sup id="GEN.31.43" class="usx-v">43</sup></a>
Laban replied, “These two women are my daughters, and their children are my grandchildren, and the animals are my animals. Everything you see here is mine [HYP]! But what can I do today to keep my daughters or the children they have given birth to [RHQ]? <a href="#GEN.31.44"><sup id="GEN.31.44" class="usx-v">44</sup></a>
I cannot do anything in order to keep them, so hey, we should make a peace agreement, you and I, and do something that will remind us about our agreement.”</p>
<p id="p-GEN.31.44" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.31.45"><sup id="GEN.31.45" class="usx-v">45</sup></a>
So Jacob took a <span id="add-GEN.31.45" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">large</span> stone and set it on its end. <a href="#GEN.31.46"><sup id="GEN.31.46" class="usx-v">46</sup></a>
Then Jacob said to his relatives, “You also gather some stones.” So they gathered some rocks and put them in a heap, and they ate some food there near the heap. <a href="#GEN.31.47"><sup id="GEN.31.47" class="usx-v">47</sup></a>
Laban gave the heap the Aramaic name Jegar-Sahadutha, <span id="add-GEN.31.47" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">which means ‘rock-pile to remind us’,</span> but Jacob gave the rock-pile the Hebrew name Galeed, <span id="add-GEN.31.47" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">which has the same meaning</span>. <a href="#GEN.31.48"><sup id="GEN.31.48" class="usx-v">48</sup></a>
Laban said to Jacob, “This pile of rocks we have put here today will help us to remember our agreement.” That is why Jacob called it Galeed. <a href="#GEN.31.49"><sup id="GEN.31.49" class="usx-v">49</sup></a>
They also named the place Mizpah, <span id="add-GEN.31.49" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">which sounds like the Hebrew word that means ‘watchtower’,</span> because Laban said, “We will ask Yahweh to watch you and me while we are separated from each other, <span id="add-GEN.31.49" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">so that we do not try to harm each other</span>. <a href="#GEN.31.50"><sup id="GEN.31.50" class="usx-v">50</sup></a>
If you mistreat my daughters, or if you take other women to be your wives, even if no one tells me about it, don’t forget that God sees what you and I are doing!”</p>
<p id="p-GEN.31.50" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.31.51"><sup id="GEN.31.51" class="usx-v">51</sup></a>
Laban also said to Jacob, “You see this large stone and this pile of rocks that we have set up to be between us. <a href="#GEN.31.52"><sup id="GEN.31.52" class="usx-v">52</sup></a>
Both this pile of rocks and this large stone will remind us, that I will not go past these rocks to harm you, and you will not go past these rocks to harm me. <a href="#GEN.31.53"><sup id="GEN.31.53" class="usx-v">53</sup></a>
We will ask the God whom <span id="add-GEN.31.53" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">your grandfather</span> Abraham and <span id="add-GEN.31.53" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">his father</span> Nahor worshiped to punish [MTY] either one of us, <span id="add-GEN.31.53" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">if we harm the other one</span>.”</p>
<p id="p-GEN.31.53" class="usx-p" >So Jacob solemnly promised to do what they said in their peace agreement. And he asked God, the one before whom his father Isaac trembled, to listen to what they promised. <a href="#GEN.31.54"><sup id="GEN.31.54" class="usx-v">54</sup></a>
He offered a sacrifice to God there in the hilly area, and he invited his relatives to eat with him. After they had eaten, they slept there that night. <a href="#GEN.31.55"><sup id="GEN.31.55" class="usx-v">55</sup></a>
The next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters <span id="add-GEN.31.55" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">goodbye</span> and asked God to bless them. Then he <span id="add-GEN.31.55" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and his men</span> left them and returned home.</p>
<a href="#GEN.32"><h3 id="GEN.32" class="usx-c">32</h3></a>
<p id="s1-GEN.32" class="usx-s1" >Jacob sent gifts to Esau as he prepared to meet him</p>

    <a href="#GEN.32.1"><sup id="GEN.32.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
As Jacob and his family continued traveling, some angels, whom God sent, met him. <a href="#GEN.32.2"><sup id="GEN.32.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
When Jacob saw them, he said, “This is God’s army camp!” So he named that place Mahanaim, <span id="add-GEN.32.2" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">which means ‘two camps’</span>.</p>
<p id="p-GEN.32.2" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.32.3"><sup id="GEN.32.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
Jacob told some of the men to go ahead of him to his older brother Esau, who was living in Seir, the land where the descendants of Edom lived. <a href="#GEN.32.4"><sup id="GEN.32.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
He told them, “This is what I want you to say to Esau: &#39;I, Jacob, want to be your servant and I want you to be my master. I have been living with our uncle Laban, and I have stayed there until now. <a href="#GEN.32.5"><sup id="GEN.32.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
I now own many cattle, donkeys, sheep, goats, and male and female slaves. Now I am sending this message to you, sir, hoping that you will ◄be friendly toward me/treat me kindly► when I arrive.’ “</p>
<p id="p-GEN.32.5" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.32.6"><sup id="GEN.32.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
The messengers went and gave that message to Esau. When they returned to Jacob, they said, “We went to your older brother Esau. Now he is coming to you, and 400 men are coming with him.”</p>
<p id="p-GEN.32.6" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.32.7"><sup id="GEN.32.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Jacob was very afraid and worried. So he divided the people who were with him into two groups. He also divided the sheep and goats, the cattle, and the camels, into two groups. <a href="#GEN.32.8"><sup id="GEN.32.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
He was thinking, “If Esau and his men come and attack us, perhaps one of the groups will be left and will be able to escape.” <a href="#GEN.32.9"><sup id="GEN.32.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
Then Jacob prayed, “O Yahweh God, whom my grandfather Abraham worshiped and my father Isaac worships, you said to me, ‘Go back to your own land and to your relatives, and I will ◄cause good things happen to/do good things for► you.’ <a href="#GEN.32.10"><sup id="GEN.32.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
I am not worthy for you to have been so kind and faithful to me in so many ways, your servant. I had only this walking stick with me when I crossed the Jordan <span id="add-GEN.32.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">River on my way to Haran</span>, but now I am so wealthy that there are two large groups of my family and possessions. <a href="#GEN.32.11"><sup id="GEN.32.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
So now I pray that you will rescue me from [MTY] my <span id="add-GEN.32.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">older </span> brother Esau, because I am afraid that he and his men will come and attack and kill me and the children and their mothers. <a href="#GEN.32.12"><sup id="GEN.32.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
But do not forget that you have said, ‘I will certainly enable you to prosper, and I will cause your descendants to be as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore, which are so many that no one can count them.’”</p>
<p id="p-GEN.32.12" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.32.13"><sup id="GEN.32.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Jacob slept there that night. The next morning he selected some animals to give to his brother Esau. <a href="#GEN.32.14"><sup id="GEN.32.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
He selected 200 female goats and 20 male goats, 200 female sheep and 20 male sheep, <a href="#GEN.32.15"><sup id="GEN.32.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
30 female camels and their offspring, 40 cows and ten bulls, 20 female donkeys and 10 male donkeys. <a href="#GEN.32.16"><sup id="GEN.32.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
He divided them into small herds, and put each herd into the care of one of his servants. He said to his servants, “Go ahead of me, one group at a time, and keep some space between each herd.” <a href="#GEN.32.17"><sup id="GEN.32.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
He said to the servant who was going with the first group, “When my brother Esau meets you, and he asks you, ‘To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and to whom do these animals in front of you belong?’ <a href="#GEN.32.18"><sup id="GEN.32.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
tell him, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob. He has sent them to you as a gift, sir. And he is coming behind us.’”</p>
<p id="p-GEN.32.18" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.32.19"><sup id="GEN.32.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
He also said the same thing to the servants who were taking care of the second and third groups, and to the other herdsmen. He said to them, “When you meet Esau, I want you to say to him the same thing that I told the first servant. <a href="#GEN.32.20"><sup id="GEN.32.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
And be sure to say ‘Jacob, who wants to serve you, is coming behind us.’” Jacob told them to say that because he was thinking, “Perhaps these gifts that I am sending ahead of me will cause him to ◄act peacefully toward/stop being angry with► me. Then later, when I see him, perhaps he will be kind to me.” <a href="#GEN.32.21"><sup id="GEN.32.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
So the men taking the gifts [PRS] went ahead, but Jacob himself stayed in the camp that night.</p>
<p id="s1-GEN.32.21" class="usx-s1" >Jacob wrestled with Yahweh</p>
<p id="p-GEN.32.21" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.32.22"><sup id="GEN.32.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
Some time during that night, Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two female slaves, and his eleven sons and his daughter, and he sent them across the ford at the Jabbok River. <a href="#GEN.32.23"><sup id="GEN.32.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
After he had done that, he sent other slaves, carrying all his possessions, across the river. <a href="#GEN.32.24"><sup id="GEN.32.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
So Jacob was left there alone. But a man came and wrestled with him until dawn. <a href="#GEN.32.25"><sup id="GEN.32.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
When the man realized that he was not winning against Jacob, he struck Jacob’s hip and caused the thigh bone to pull away from the hip socket. <a href="#GEN.32.26"><sup id="GEN.32.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
Then the man said, “Let me go, because it will soon be daylight.” <span id="add-GEN.32.26" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Then Jacob realized who he was really wrestling with</span>.

The man said to him, “What is your name?” He replied, “Jacob.” <a href="#GEN.32.28"><sup id="GEN.32.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
The man said, “Your name will no longer be Jacob. Your name will be Israel, <span id="add-GEN.32.28" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">which means ‘he struggles with God’,</span> because you have struggled with God and with people, and you have won.” <a href="#GEN.32.29"><sup id="GEN.32.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>
Jacob said, “Now, please tell me your name!” The man replied, “◄Why do you ask me what my name is?/You should not have to ask me what my name is!►” [RHQ] But he blessed Jacob there. <a href="#GEN.32.30"><sup id="GEN.32.30" class="usx-v">30</sup></a>
So Jacob named the place Peniel, <span id="add-GEN.32.30" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">which means ‘God’s face’,</span> saying “I looked directly at God, but I did not die because of doing that.”</p>
<p id="p-GEN.32.30" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.32.31"><sup id="GEN.32.31" class="usx-v">31</sup></a>
The sun was rising as Jacob left Peniel, and he was limping because of what had happened to his hip. <a href="#GEN.32.32"><sup id="GEN.32.32" class="usx-v">32</sup></a>
The muscle on his hip joint had been injured. So to this present time, because of what happened to Jacob, the Israeli people do not eat the muscle/tendon that is attached to the socket of the hips of animals.</p>

One day Dinah, the daughter of Jacob and Leah, went to visit some of the women in that area. <a href="#GEN.34.2"><sup id="GEN.34.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
Shechem, one of the sons of Hamor, the ruler of that area who was descended from the Hiv people-group, saw her. He wanted her. So he grabbed her and forced her to have sex [EUP] with him. <a href="#GEN.34.3"><sup id="GEN.34.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
He [SYN] was very much attracted to her, and fell in love with her, and he tried to get her to love him. <a href="#GEN.34.4"><sup id="GEN.34.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
So Shechem said to his father Hamor, “Please get this girl for me. I want her to become my wife!”</p>
<p id="p-GEN.34.4" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.34.5"><sup id="GEN.34.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
Jacob very soon found out that his daughter Dinah had been disgraced/defiled. But his sons were in the fields with his livestock, so he did nothing about it until they returned home.</p>
<p id="p-GEN.34.5" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.34.6"><sup id="GEN.34.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
In the meantime, Shechem’s father Hamor went to talk with Jacob. <a href="#GEN.34.7"><sup id="GEN.34.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
While they were still talking, Jacob’s sons came in from the field. When they found out what had happened, they were shocked and very angry. They said, “Shechem has done something that is very disgraceful among us Israeli people, something that never should be done!”</p>
<p id="p-GEN.34.7" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.34.8"><sup id="GEN.34.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
But Hamor said to them, “My son Shechem really likes this girl. Please allow him to marry her. <a href="#GEN.34.9"><sup id="GEN.34.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
Let’s make an agreement: You will give your daughters to our young men to be their wives, and we will give our daughters to your young men to be their wives. <a href="#GEN.34.10"><sup id="GEN.34.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>

    <a href="#GEN.34.11"><sup id="GEN.34.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
Then Shechem said to Dinah’s father and brothers, “If you feel good toward me and do what I am asking for, I will give you whatever you ask for. <a href="#GEN.34.12"><sup id="GEN.34.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
Tell me what gifts you want and what bride price you want, and I will give you what you ask for. I just want you to give the girl to me to be my wife.”</p>

    <a href="#GEN.34.13"><sup id="GEN.34.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
But because Shechem had done a shameful thing to their sister Dinah, the sons of Jacob deceived Shechem and his father Hamor <a href="#GEN.34.14"><sup id="GEN.34.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
by saying to them, “No, we cannot do that. We cannot give our sister to be the wife of a man who is not circumcised, because that would be a shameful thing for us to do. <a href="#GEN.34.15"><sup id="GEN.34.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
We will do that only if you do one thing: You must become like us by circumcising all the males that are among you. <a href="#GEN.34.16"><sup id="GEN.34.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
Then we will give our daughters to your young men to be your wives, and we will take your daughters to be the wives of our young men. We will live among you, and we will become one people-group. <a href="#GEN.34.17"><sup id="GEN.34.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>

    <a href="#GEN.34.18"><sup id="GEN.34.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
What they said pleased Hamor and his son Shechem. <a href="#GEN.34.19"><sup id="GEN.34.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
Shechem was very much in love with Jacob’s daughter, so he quickly agreed to do what they suggested. <a href="#GEN.34.20"><sup id="GEN.34.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
Shechem went with Hamor to the meeting place near the city gate, and they spoke to the city leaders, saying, <a href="#GEN.34.21"><sup id="GEN.34.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
“These men are friendly toward us. We should let them live here and travel around (OR, buy and sell things) and if they find land that they want, they can buy it.

Our young men can marry their daughters, and their young men can marry our daughters. <a href="#GEN.34.22"><sup id="GEN.34.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
But these men will agree to live among us and become one people-group with us only if all our males are circumcised, as they are. <a href="#GEN.34.23"><sup id="GEN.34.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
But if we do that, just think! Their livestock and their possessions and their other animals will become ours [RHQ]! So we should agree to do what they suggest, and then they will live among us!” <a href="#GEN.34.24"><sup id="GEN.34.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
Shechem was the most respected person in his father’s household, so all the men who were there at the city gate agreed to what Hamor and Shechem suggested. So every male in the city was circumcised.</p>
<p id="p-GEN.34.24" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.34.25"><sup id="GEN.34.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
On the third day after that, when the men of the city were still sore because of being circumcised, two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, who were Dinah’s brothers, took their swords and entered the city without anyone opposing them, and killed all the men. <a href="#GEN.34.26"><sup id="GEN.34.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
They even killed Hamor and his son Shechem. Then they took Dinah out of Shechem’s house and left the city. <a href="#GEN.34.27"><sup id="GEN.34.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
Then the other sons of Jacob went into the city where all those dead bodies were. They ◄looted/took everything in► the city to get revenge for the shameful thing that had been done to their sister. <a href="#GEN.34.28"><sup id="GEN.34.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
They took away the people’s sheep and goats, their cattle, their donkeys, and everything else that they wanted from inside the city and from out in the countryside. <a href="#GEN.34.29"><sup id="GEN.34.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>
They took away everything that was valuable, even the children and the women. They seized and took away everything that was in the houses.</p>
<p id="p-GEN.34.29" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.34.30"><sup id="GEN.34.30" class="usx-v">30</sup></a>
Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have caused a lot of trouble for me!

I do not have many men to fight for us, so if they all gather together and come to me and attack us, they will destroy us and all our household!” <a href="#GEN.34.31"><sup id="GEN.34.31" class="usx-v">31</sup></a>

Meanwhile, the descendants of Ishmael took Joseph down to Egypt. There Potiphar bought Joseph from them. Potiphar was an Egyptian who was one of the king’s officials and the captain of the king’s ◄palace guards/guards who protected the king►. <a href="#GEN.39.2"><sup id="GEN.39.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
Because Yahweh helped Joseph, he was able to do his work very well, and lived in the house of his Egyptian master. <a href="#GEN.39.3"><sup id="GEN.39.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
His master saw that Yahweh was helping Joseph and enabling him to be successful in everything that he did. <a href="#GEN.39.4"><sup id="GEN.39.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
Joseph’s master was pleased with him, so he appointed him to be his personal servant. Then he appointed him to be the one who would take care of everything in his household and all of his possessions. <a href="#GEN.39.5"><sup id="GEN.39.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
From the time Potiphar appointed Joseph to take care of everything in his household and all that he owned, Yahweh blessed the people who lived in Potiphar’s house because of Joseph. He also caused Potiphar’s crops to grow well. <a href="#GEN.39.6"><sup id="GEN.39.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
Potiphar allowed Joseph to take care of everything that he owned. Potiphar needed to decide only about the food he ate. He was not concerned about anything else in his house.</p>

Potiphar’s wife grabbed his cloak and said, “Have sex [EUP] with me!” Joseph ran out of the house, but his cloak was still in her hand! <a href="#GEN.39.13"><sup id="GEN.39.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
When she saw that he had run outside leaving his cloak in her hand, <a href="#GEN.39.14"><sup id="GEN.39.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
she called the household servants. She said to them, “Look! This Hebrew man that my husband brought to us is ◄insulting/trying to do something disgraceful to► us!

She kept the loincloth beside her until her husband, Joseph’s master, came home. <a href="#GEN.39.17"><sup id="GEN.39.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>

Joseph’s master took Joseph and put him in prison, the place where all the king’s prisoners were put, and Joseph stayed there.</p>

    <a href="#GEN.39.21"><sup id="GEN.39.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>

Some time later, two of the king of Egypt’s officials did things that displeased him.

The king became angry with both of them. <a href="#GEN.40.3"><sup id="GEN.40.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
So he had them put in prison, in the house of the captain of the palace guards. That was the place where Joseph was being kept. <a href="#GEN.40.4"><sup id="GEN.40.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
The two men were in prison for a long time. And during that time the captain of the palace guards appointed Joseph to be their servant, to take care of their needs.</p>
<p id="p-GEN.40.4" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.40.5"><sup id="GEN.40.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
One night while the king’s drink-server and his baker were there in the prison, each of them had a dream. Each dream had a different meaning.</p>

    <a href="#GEN.40.6"><sup id="GEN.40.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
The next morning, when Joseph came to them, he saw that both of them were dejected/worried. <a href="#GEN.40.7"><sup id="GEN.40.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
So he asked them, “Why do you look so sad today?” <a href="#GEN.40.8"><sup id="GEN.40.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
One of them answered, “We both had dreams last night, but there is no one who can tell us the meaning of the dreams.” Joseph said to them, “God is the only one who can [RHQ] tell the meaning of dreams.

So the king’s chief drink-server told his dream to Joseph. He said, “In my dream I saw a grapevine in front of me. <a href="#GEN.40.10"><sup id="GEN.40.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
On the vine there were three branches. After the branches budded, they blossomed, and then they produced clusters of grapes. <a href="#GEN.40.11"><sup id="GEN.40.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
I was holding the king’s cup, so I took the grapes and squeezed the juice into the cup. Then I gave the cup to the king to drink the juice.” <a href="#GEN.40.12"><sup id="GEN.40.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
<span id="add-GEN.40.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">God immediately told Joseph what the dream meant</span>.

Within three days the king will release you from prison. He will let you do the work that you did before. You will take cups of wine to the king as you did before, when you were his drink-server. <a href="#GEN.40.14"><sup id="GEN.40.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
But when you are out of prison and everything goes well for you, please do not forget me. <a href="#GEN.40.15"><sup id="GEN.40.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>

When the chief baker heard that the meaning of the dream of the king’s drink-server was very favorable, he said to Joseph, “I also had a dream. In the dream I was surprised to see three baskets of bread stacked on my head. <a href="#GEN.40.17"><sup id="GEN.40.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>

The third day after that was the ◄king’s birthday/day they celebrated when the king became one year older►. On that day the king invited all his officials to celebrate his birthday.

When Joseph rode in the chariot, men shouted to the people who were on the road in front of him, “Get off the road!” So the king put Joseph in charge of everything in the country.</p>
<p id="p-GEN.41.43" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.41.44"><sup id="GEN.41.44" class="usx-v">44</sup></a>
The king said to Joseph, “I am the king, but no one in the whole land of Egypt will do anything [IDM] if you do not permit them to do it.” <a href="#GEN.41.45"><sup id="GEN.41.45" class="usx-v">45</sup></a>
The king gave Joseph a new name, Zaphenath-Paneah. He also gave him Asenath to be his wife. She was the daughter of Potiphera, who was a priest in a temple in On <span id="add-GEN.41.45" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">city</span>. Then Joseph became known (OR, traveled) through all the land of Egypt.</p>
<p id="p-GEN.41.45" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.41.46"><sup id="GEN.41.46" class="usx-v">46</sup></a>
Joseph was 30 years old when he started to work for the king of Egypt. To do his work, he left the king’s palace and traveled throughout Egypt. <a href="#GEN.41.47"><sup id="GEN.41.47" class="usx-v">47</sup></a>
During the next seven years, the land produced abundant crops, so there was plenty of food. <a href="#GEN.41.48"><sup id="GEN.41.48" class="usx-v">48</sup></a>
As Joseph supervised them, his helpers collected one-fifth of all the grain that was produced during those years, and stored it in the cities. In each city, he had his helpers store up the grain that was grown in the fields that surrounded that city. <a href="#GEN.41.49"><sup id="GEN.41.49" class="usx-v">49</sup></a>
Joseph had them store up a huge amount of grain. It looked as plentiful as the sand on the seashore. There was so much grain that after a while they stopped keeping records of how much grain was stored, because there was more grain than they could measure.</p>
<p id="p-GEN.41.49" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.41.50"><sup id="GEN.41.50" class="usx-v">50</sup></a>
Before the seven years of famine started, Joseph’s wife Asenath gave birth to two sons. <a href="#GEN.41.51"><sup id="GEN.41.51" class="usx-v">51</sup></a>
Joseph named the first one Manasseh, <span id="add-GEN.41.51" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">which sounds like the Hebrew word that means ‘forget</span>’, because, he said, “God has caused me to forget all my troubles and all my father’s family.” <a href="#GEN.41.52"><sup id="GEN.41.52" class="usx-v">52</sup></a>
He named his second son Ephraim, <span id="add-GEN.41.52" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">which means ‘to have children</span>’, because, he said, “God has given me children here in this land where I have suffered.”</p>
<p id="p-GEN.41.52" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.41.53"><sup id="GEN.41.53" class="usx-v">53</sup></a>
Finally the seven years in which there was plenty of food ended. <a href="#GEN.41.54"><sup id="GEN.41.54" class="usx-v">54</sup></a>
Then the seven years of famine started, just as Joseph had predicted. There was also a famine in all the other nearby lands, but although the crops did not grow, there was food everywhere in Egypt, because of the grain they had stored up in the cities. <a href="#GEN.41.55"><sup id="GEN.41.55" class="usx-v">55</sup></a>
When all the people of [MTY] Egypt had eaten all of their own food and were still hungry, they begged the king for food. So the king told all the people of Egypt, “Go to Joseph, and do what he tells you to do.”</p>
<p id="p-GEN.41.55" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.41.56"><sup id="GEN.41.56" class="usx-v">56</sup></a>
When the famine was very bad throughout the whole country, Joseph ordered his helpers to open the storehouses. Then they sold the grain in the storehouses to the people of Egypt, because the famine was very severe all over Egypt. <a href="#GEN.41.57"><sup id="GEN.41.57" class="usx-v">57</sup></a>
And people from many [HYP] nearby countries came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was very severe everywhere [HYP].</p>
<a href="#GEN.42"><h3 id="GEN.42" class="usx-c">42</h3></a>
<p id="s1-GEN.42" class="usx-s1" >Joseph’s brothers went to Egypt to buy grain, but didn’t realize they were buying it from their brother</p>

    <a href="#GEN.42.1"><sup id="GEN.42.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
When someone told Jacob that there was grain in Egypt that people could buy, he said to his sons, “◄Why do you just sit there looking at each other?/Do not just sit there looking at each other!► [RHQ] We need some grain!” <a href="#GEN.42.2"><sup id="GEN.42.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
He said to them, “Someone told me that there is grain for sale in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us, in order that we will not die!”</p>
<p id="p-GEN.42.2" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.42.3"><sup id="GEN.42.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
So Joseph’s ten <span id="add-GEN.42.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">older</span> brothers went down to Egypt to buy some grain. <a href="#GEN.42.4"><sup id="GEN.42.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph’s <span id="add-GEN.42.4" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">younger</span> brother, to go with the others, because he was afraid/worried that something terrible might happen to him like what happened to Joseph. <a href="#GEN.42.5"><sup id="GEN.42.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
So Jacob’s other sons went down from Canaan to Egypt to buy grain, and others from there went too, because there was a famine in Canaan also.</p>
<p id="p-GEN.42.5" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.42.6"><sup id="GEN.42.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
At that time Joseph was the governor of Egypt. He was the one who sold grain to people who came from all over Egypt and from many other countries [HYP] to buy grain. So when Joseph’s brothers arrived, <span id="add-GEN.42.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">they were told that it was necessary for them to talk with Joseph.

As soon as Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them. But he pretended that he did not know them. He spoke harshly to them, saying, “Where do you come from?” One of them replied, “We have come from Canaan, to buy some grain.”</p>
<p id="p-GEN.42.7" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.42.8"><sup id="GEN.42.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him. <a href="#GEN.42.9"><sup id="GEN.42.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
And then Joseph remembered what he had dreamed about them many years previously. <span id="add-GEN.42.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">But he decided not to tell them yet that he was their younger brother</span>. He said to them, “You are spies!

One of them replied, “No, sir! We have come to buy grain. <a href="#GEN.42.11"><sup id="GEN.42.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
We are all sons of one man. We are honest men, not spies.” <a href="#GEN.42.12"><sup id="GEN.42.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
He said to them, “<span id="add-GEN.42.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">I do not believe you</span>.

But one of them replied, “No, that is not true! Originally there were twelve of us who were brothers, the sons of one man. Our younger brother is with our father.

Send one of your group to go and get your younger brother and bring him here. I will put the rest of you in prison, in order that I may test what you have said to find out whether what you are telling me is true.

Then Joseph put them all in prison for three days.</p>

    <a href="#GEN.42.18"><sup id="GEN.42.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
On the third day, Joseph went to the prison and said to them, “I am a man who fears that God <span id="add-GEN.42.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">will punish me if I do not do what I promise</span>.

But if you come back here again, you must bring your youngest brother to me, so that you can prove that what you told me is true, and as a result I will not have you executed.” So they agreed to do that.</p>
<p id="p-GEN.42.20" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.42.21"><sup id="GEN.42.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>

While they were talking with Joseph, they were speaking through ◄an interpreter/someone who knew their language and the Egyptian language►, but when they said these things among themselves, they were speaking in their own language, and they did not know that Joseph could understand their language, and that he could understand what they were saying. <a href="#GEN.42.24"><sup id="GEN.42.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
<span id="add-GEN.42.24" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Because of what they said, Joseph realized that they admitted that what they had done to him many years previously was wrong</span>.

Joseph told his servants to fill the men’s sacks with grain, but he also told them to put the money that each one had paid for the grain in the top of his sack.

Then he took them into Joseph’s house. He gave them water to wash their feet and gave them food for the donkeys. <a href="#GEN.43.25"><sup id="GEN.43.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
He told them that they were going to eat with Joseph at noon. So the men prepared their gifts to give to Joseph when he arrived.</p>

    <a href="#GEN.43.26"><sup id="GEN.43.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
When Joseph came home, they presented to him the gifts that they had brought into the house. Then they bowed down to the ground in front of him. <a href="#GEN.43.27"><sup id="GEN.43.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
He asked them if they were ◄well/in good health►, and then he asked, “How is the health of your old father, the one that you told me about? Is he still living?” <a href="#GEN.43.28"><sup id="GEN.43.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
One of them replied, “Yes, our father, <span id="add-GEN.43.28" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">who is willing to be</span> your servant, is still alive, and he is well.” Then again they bowed down in front of him.</p>

Then he saw his <span id="add-GEN.43.29" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">younger</span> brother Benjamin, his own mother’s other son. He asked them, “Is this your youngest brother, the one whom you told me about?” After they said “Yes,” he said to Benjamin, “Young man, I pray that God will act kindly toward you.” <a href="#GEN.43.30"><sup id="GEN.43.30" class="usx-v">30</sup></a>
Joseph quickly left the room. He realized that he was about to cry because he ◄was full of emotion about his younger brother/loved his younger brother so much►. He went into his private room and cried there. <a href="#GEN.43.31"><sup id="GEN.43.31" class="usx-v">31</sup></a>
Then, after he washed the tears from his face, he came out, and controlling his emotions, he said to the servants, “Serve the food!”</p>
<p id="p-GEN.43.31" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.43.32"><sup id="GEN.43.32" class="usx-v">32</sup></a>
The people of Egypt considered that it was disgraceful for them to eat with Hebrews, so the servants served food to Joseph by himself, and served the other people of Egypt who ate with him by themselves, and they served Joseph’s older brothers and younger brother by themselves. <a href="#GEN.43.33"><sup id="GEN.43.33" class="usx-v">33</sup></a>
His brothers were astonished to see that their seats were arranged according to their ages, from the oldest to the youngest! <a href="#GEN.43.34"><sup id="GEN.43.34" class="usx-v">34</sup></a>
And when their portions of food were served to them from Joseph’s table, Benjamin’s portion was five times as much as anyone else’s portion! So they ate food and drank wine with Joseph and became very cheerful.</p>

When his brothers were ready to return home, Joseph said to the man who was in charge of things in his house, “Fill the sacks of those men with as much grain as they can carry <span id="add-GEN.44.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">on their donkeys</span>. And put in the top of each man’s sack the silver that he paid for the grain. <a href="#GEN.44.2"><sup id="GEN.44.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
Then put my silver cup in the top of the youngest brother’s sack, along with the silver that he paid for the grain.” So the servant did what Joseph told him to do.</p>

When they had not gone far from the city, Joseph said to the servant in charge of things in his house, “Pursue those men immediately.

<p id="p-GEN.44.10" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.44.11"><sup id="GEN.44.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
Each of the men quickly lowered his sack down from the donkey to the ground and opened it. <a href="#GEN.44.12"><sup id="GEN.44.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
Then the servant started to search for the cup in each sack. He started with the oldest brother’s sack and ended with the youngest one’s sack. And he found the cup in Benjamin’s sack and showed it to them. <a href="#GEN.44.13"><sup id="GEN.44.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
The brothers tore their clothes <span id="add-GEN.44.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">because they were so dismayed</span>. They loaded the sacks on the donkeys again and returned to the city.</p>

But Joseph replied, “No, I could never do anything like that. Only the man in whose sack the cup was found will become my slave. The rest of you can return to your father peacefully.”</p>

You asked us, ‘Is your father still living, and do you have another brother?’ <a href="#GEN.44.20"><sup id="GEN.44.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
We answered, ‘Our father is alive, but he is an old man. He has a young son who was born after our father became an old man.

Joseph also provided food for all his father’s family. The amounts that he gave them were according to how many children each of them had.</p>
<p id="s1-GEN.47.12" class="usx-s1" >Joseph arranged for people to buy grain from him during the famine</p>

    <a href="#GEN.47.13"><sup id="GEN.47.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
There were no crops growing in the whole region, because the famine was very severe. The people of Egypt and Canaan [MTY] became weak because they did not have enough food to eat. <a href="#GEN.47.14"><sup id="GEN.47.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
Joseph collected all the money that the people in Egypt and Canaan paid for the grain they were buying from him, and he brought the money to the king’s palace. <a href="#GEN.47.15"><sup id="GEN.47.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
When the people of Egypt and Canaan had spent all their money for grain, they all kept coming to Joseph and saying, “Please give us some food! If you do not give us grain, we will die [RHQ]! We have used all our money to buy food, and we have no money left!” <a href="#GEN.47.16"><sup id="GEN.47.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
Joseph replied, “Since your money is all gone, bring me your livestock. If you do that, I will give you food in exchange for your livestock.” <a href="#GEN.47.17"><sup id="GEN.47.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
So they brought their livestock to Joseph. He gave them food in exchange for their horses, their sheep and goats, their cattle, and their donkeys.</p>
<p id="p-GEN.47.17" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.47.18"><sup id="GEN.47.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
The next year they came to him again and said, “We cannot hide this from you: We have no more money, and now our livestock belongs to you. We have only our bodies and our land to give to you. We have nothing else left. <a href="#GEN.47.19"><sup id="GEN.47.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
◄If you do not give us some food, we will die!/Do you want to watch us die?► [RHQ] If you do not give us seeds, our fields will become useless [IDM]. Buy us and our land in exchange for food.

<p id="p-GEN.47.19" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#GEN.47.20"><sup id="GEN.47.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
So Joseph bought all the farms in Egypt for the king. The people of Egypt each sold their land to him because the famine was very severe, <span id="add-GEN.47.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and they had no other way to get money to buy food</span>. So all the farms became the king’s farms. <a href="#GEN.47.21"><sup id="GEN.47.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
As a result, Joseph caused all the people from one border of the country to the other to become the king’s slaves. <a href="#GEN.47.22"><sup id="GEN.47.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
But he did not buy the priests’ land, because they received food from the king regularly, so the food that the king gave them was enough for them. That is the reason they did not sell their land to him. <a href="#GEN.47.23"><sup id="GEN.47.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
Joseph said to the people <span id="add-GEN.47.23" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">who sold themselves and their land to him</span>, “Listen to me! Today I have bought you and your land for the king. So here are seeds for you so that you can plant them in the ground. <a href="#GEN.47.24"><sup id="GEN.47.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
But when you harvest the crop, you must give one-fifth of the crop to the king. The rest of the crop you can keep, to be seed to plant in the fields, and to be food for you and your children and for everyone else in your household to eat.” <a href="#GEN.47.25"><sup id="GEN.47.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
They replied, “You have saved our lives! We want you to be pleased with us. And we will be the king’s slaves.”</p>

    <a href="#GEN.47.26"><sup id="GEN.47.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
So Joseph made a law about all the land in Egypt, stating that one-fifth of the crops that are harvested belongs to the king. That law still exists. Only the land that belonged to the priests did not become the king’s land.</p>

    <a href="#GEN.47.27"><sup id="GEN.47.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
Jacob and his family started to live in Egypt, in the Goshen region. They acquired property there. Many children were born to them there. As a result, their population increased greatly.</p>

But Joseph replied to them, “Do not be afraid! <span id="add-GEN.50.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">God is the one who punishes people</span>; ◄am I God?/I am not God!► [RHQ] <a href="#GEN.50.20"><sup id="GEN.50.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
As for you, yes, you wanted to do something very evil to me. But God caused something good to come from it! He wanted to save many people from dying of hunger, and that is what happened! Today they are alive! <a href="#GEN.50.21"><sup id="GEN.50.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
So I say <span id="add-GEN.50.21" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">again</span>, do not be afraid! I will make sure that you and your children have enough to eat.” In that way he reassured them and made made them feel much better.</p>

Joseph lived with his father’s family in Egypt until he was 110 years old. <a href="#GEN.50.23"><sup id="GEN.50.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
He lived long enough to see Ephraim’s children and grandchildren. The children of Joseph’s grandson Machir, who was Manasseh’s son, were born before Joseph died, and were adopted by Joseph to be his own children [IDM]. <a href="#GEN.50.24"><sup id="GEN.50.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
One day Joseph said to his <span id="add-GEN.50.24" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">older</span> brothers, “I am about to die. But God will certainly ◄help/take care of► you. And <span id="add-GEN.50.24" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">some day</span> he will lead your <span id="add-GEN.50.24" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">descendants</span> up out of this land and take them to Canaan, the land that he solemnly promised to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.” <a href="#GEN.50.25"><sup id="GEN.50.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
Then Joseph said, “When God enables you to do that, you must take my body back to Canaan.” He made his older brothers solemnly promise to do that.</p>

    <a href="#GEN.50.26"><sup id="GEN.50.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
So Joseph died in Egypt when he was 110 years old. His body was embalmed and put in a coffin there.</p>
