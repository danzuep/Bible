Previously we had told the king that our God takes care of all those who truly trust in him, but that he becomes very angry with those who refuse to obey him.

As I gave these various items to those priests, I weighed each of the items. This was the total: 25 tons of silver, 100 items made from silver that altogether weighed 7,500 pounds, ◄7,500 pounds/3,400 kg.► of gold, <a href="#EZR.8.27"><sup id="EZR.8.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
20 gold bowls that altogether weighed ◄19 pounds/8.6 kg.►, and two items made of polished bronze that were as valuable as ones made of gold.</p>

So guard them carefully, and <span id="add-EZR.8.29" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">when we arrive</span> in Jerusalem, weigh them in the presence of the priests, the descendants of Levi <span id="add-EZR.8.29" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">who will help the priests</span>, and the other Israeli leaders there.

They are commands that you gave to your servants, the prophets, to tell to us. They said that the land that we would occupy was polluted because of the detestable/disgusting things that were done by the people who lived there. They said that in the land there were people from one end to the other who did immoral/shameful things. <a href="#EZR.9.12"><sup id="EZR.9.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
They said, ‘Do not allow your daughters to marry their sons! Do not allow your sons to marry their daughters! Do not even try to cause things to go well for those people-groups! If you obey these instructions, your nation will be strong, and you will enjoy the good crops that grow on the land, and the land will belong to your descendants forever.’</p>

However, some of us are again disobeying your commands, and we are marrying women who do those detestable things.

    <a href="#EZR.10.1"><sup id="EZR.10.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
While I was kneeling down in front of the temple and praying and crying, I was confessing <span id="add-EZR.10.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the sins that the Israeli people had committed</span>. Many people, men and women and children, gathered around me and also cried very much. <a href="#EZR.10.2"><sup id="EZR.10.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
Then Shecaniah, the son of Jehiel from the clan of Elam, said this to me: “We have disobeyed God. <span id="add-EZR.10.2" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Some of</span> us have married women who are not Israelis. But we can still confidently expect <span id="add-EZR.10.2" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Yahweh to be merciful to</span> us Israeli people. <a href="#EZR.10.3"><sup id="EZR.10.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
We will do what you, and the others who have an awesome respect for what our God has commanded, tell us to do. We will do what God told us in his laws.

<p id="p-EZR.10.4" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EZR.10.5"><sup id="EZR.10.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
So I stood up and demanded that the leaders of the priests, the <span id="add-EZR.10.5" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">other</span> descendants of Levi, and all <span id="add-EZR.10.5" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the other</span> Israeli people solemnly declare that they would do what Shecaniah said that they should do. So they all solemnly promised to do that. <a href="#EZR.10.6"><sup id="EZR.10.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
Then I went away from the front of the temple and went to the room where Jehohanan lived. I stayed there that night, but I did not eat or drink anything. I was still sad because some of the Israelis who had returned <span id="add-EZR.10.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">from Babylonia</span> had not faithfully obeyed <span id="add-EZR.10.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">God’s laws</span>.</p>
<p id="p-EZR.10.6" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EZR.10.7"><sup id="EZR.10.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Then we sent a message to all <span id="add-EZR.10.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the people in</span> Jerusalem and <span id="add-EZR.10.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in other towns in</span> Judah, saying that all those who had returned <span id="add-EZR.10.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">from Babylonia</span> should come to Jerusalem immediately. <a href="#EZR.10.8"><sup id="EZR.10.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
We said that if any of them did not arrive within three days, the leaders of the people would order that all the property of those people would be taken from them, and that they would no longer be considered to belong to the Israeli people; <span id="add-EZR.10.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">they would be considered to be foreigners</span>.</p>
<p id="p-EZR.10.8" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EZR.10.9"><sup id="EZR.10.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
So within three days, on December 19, all the people of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin gathered in Jerusalem. They were there, sitting in the courtyard in front of the temple. They were trembling because it was raining hard and because they were worried <span id="add-EZR.10.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that they would be punished for what they had done</span>. <a href="#EZR.10.10"><sup id="EZR.10.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
Then I stood up and said to them, “<span id="add-EZR.10.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Some of</span> you men have committed a very bad sin. You have married women who are not Israelis.

So now you must confess to Yahweh, the God whom your ancestors <span id="add-EZR.10.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">worshiped/belonged to</span>, the sin which you have committed, and you must do what he wants. Separate yourselves from the people of other nations and from the women from those nations whom you have married.”</p>
<p id="p-EZR.10.11" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EZR.10.12"><sup id="EZR.10.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
The whole group answered, shouting loudly, “Yes, what you have said is right! We will do what you have said.” <a href="#EZR.10.13"><sup id="EZR.10.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
But then <span id="add-EZR.10.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">one of</span> them said, “But we are a very large group, and it is raining hard. Also, there are many of us who have committed this bad sin. This is something that we cannot ◄take care of/handle► in one or two days, and we cannot stand here in this rain. <a href="#EZR.10.14"><sup id="EZR.10.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
So allow our leaders to decide for all of us what we should do. Tell everyone who has married a woman who is not Israeli to come at a time that you decide. They should come with the elders and judges from each city. If we do that, our God will stop being angry with us <span id="add-EZR.10.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">because of what we have done</span>.”</p>
<p id="p-EZR.10.14" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EZR.10.15"><sup id="EZR.10.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
Jonathan the son of Asahel, Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah, Meshullam, and Shabbethai, a descendant of Levi, were the only ones who objected to this.</p>

    <a href="#EZR.10.16"><sup id="EZR.10.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
All the others who had returned from Babylonia said that they would do it. So I chose leaders of each of the clans, and I wrote down their names. On December 29, these men came and sat down to investigate the matter. <a href="#EZR.10.17"><sup id="EZR.10.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
