<span id="add-2CO.13.4" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">It is true that</span> Christ <span id="add-2CO.13.4" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">seemed to be</span> weak when he was crucified {when <span id="add-2CO.13.4" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">people</span> killed him by nailing him to the cross}.
