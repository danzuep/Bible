<p>
    <sup>1</sup>This is King Solomon’s most beautiful song.</p><p>The young woman speaks to her lover</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Kiss me on my lips,</p><p>because your love for me is more delightful than wine.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>The fragrance of the cologne on your skin is very sweet/pleasing [CHI].</p><p>And your reputation is very good and spreads,</p><p>
    like [SIM] the fragrance of the special oil spread on your skin.</p><p>That is why the other young women are attracted to you.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Take me quickly;</p><p>take me to your home.</p><p>
    It is as though you are my king;</p><p>take me into your room.</p><p>Their friends speak to the man</p><p>We are very happy [DOU] about you;</p><p>we say that your love for each other is better than wine.</p><p>It is not surprising that the other young women adore you.</p><p>The woman speaks</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>You women of Jerusalem,</p><p>I am dark but beautiful;</p><p>my dark skin is like [SIM] the tents in Kedar,</p><p>
    or like the beautiful curtains in Solomon’s palace.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    But do not stare at me because of the sun having caused my skin to become dark;</p><p>my brothers were angry with me,</p><p>
    so they forced me to work out in the sunshine in the vineyards,</p><p>so I was not able to take good care of my body/skin [CHI, MET].</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>You whom I [SYN] love, where will you take your flock of sheep today?</p><p>Where will you allow them to rest at noontime?</p><p>I want to know because it is not right [RHQ] for me to wander around like a prostitute</p><p>looking for you among the flocks that belong to your friends.</p><p>The man speaks</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>You who are the most beautiful of all the women,</p><p>if you search for me and do not know where I will take my sheep,</p><p>follow the tracks/footprints of the sheep.</p><p>
    Then allow your young goats to ◄graze/eat grass► near the shepherds’ tents.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>You are beautiful, my darling, like the young female horse</p><p>that pulls the chariot of the king of Egypt.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Your cheeks are decorated with jewelry,</p><p>and there are strings of beads/pearls around your neck.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>We will make for you some gold earrings</p><p>that are decorated/inlaid with silver.</p><p>The woman speaks</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>While the king was on his couch,</p><p>the smell of my perfume spread around the room.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>The man who loves me is as delightful as [MET] a ◄sachet/small cloth bag► of myrrh between my breasts.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>He is like [MET] a bunch of flowers from the vineyards at En-Gedi.</p><p>The man speaks</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>You whom I love, you are beautiful;</p><p>you are very beautiful!</p><p>Your eyes are as delightful/charming as doves.</p><p>The woman replies</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>You who love me, you are very delightful/handsome,</p><p>you are wonderful!</p><p>This green grass will be like a couch where we lie down.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    Branches of cedar trees will shade us;</p><p>
    it is as though branches of juniper/pine trees will be like [MET] a roof over our heads.</p><a href="#SONG OF SONGS-c-2"><h3 id="SONG OF SONGS-c-2">2</h3></a>
<p>The woman speaks</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>I am like [MET] a flower/rose from the Sharon Plain,</p><p>and like [MET] a lily that grows in a valley.</p><p>The man speaks</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Among the other young women,</p><p>the one whom I love is like [MET] a lily growing among thorns!</p><p>The woman speaks</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>And among the other men, you, the man who loves me, are like [MET] an apple/fruit tree that grows in the forest.</p><p>
    You are like a tree whose shadow protects me from the sun,</p><p>and your being close to me [EUP] is like [MET] eating sweet fruit.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>You led me to the ◄banquet room/room where we could make love►,</p><p>and it is evident that you love me very much.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Refresh me and strengthen me with your lovemaking</p><p>
    like I am refreshed by eating [MET, EUP] raisins and other fruit,</p><p>because I very much desire that you love me even more.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Put your left arm under my head</p><p>and with your right arm hold me close.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>You young women of Jerusalem,</p><p>solemnly promise me, while the does and gazelles are listening, that you will not</p><p>disturb us while we are making love</p><p>until we are ready to quit.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>I hear the voice of the man who loves me.</p><p>
    It is as though [MET] he is leaping over the mountains</p><p>and skipping over the hills</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>like [SIM] a deer or a gazelle.</p><p>Now he is standing outside the wall of our house,</p><p>looking in the window,</p><p>and peering through the ◄lattice/wooden strips inside the window frame►.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>He spoke to me and said,</p><p>“You whom I love, get up;</p><p>my beautiful one, come with me [CHI]!</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Look, the ◄winter/cold season► is ended;</p><p>the rain has stopped;</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>flowers are blooming throughout the country/land.</p><p>It is now time to sing;</p><p>we hear the doves cooing.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>There are young/new figs on the fig trees,</p><p>and there are blossoms on the grapevines</p><p>and their fragrance fills the air.</p><p>You whom I love, get up;</p><p>my beautiful one, come with me!</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    You are like [MET] a dove that is hiding far from me in an opening/crack in the rocky cliff.</p><p>Show me your face,</p><p>and allow me to hear your voice,</p><p>because your voice is sweet-sounding</p><p>and your face is lovely [CHI].”</p><p>The woman continues to speak</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    There are other men who are like [MET] little jackals/foxes that ruin vineyards;</p><p>do not allow those men to attack me.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>You who love me, I belong to you and you belong to me,</p><p>and you experience pleasure when you kiss my lips</p><p>
    like [MET] a shepherd enjoys taking care of his sheep.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>You who love me, come and be like [SIM] a gazelle or like a young deer on the hills of Bether,</p><p>and then flee like a deer at dawn tomorrow morning,</p><p>when the darkness fades.</p><a href="#SONG OF SONGS-c-3"><h3 id="SONG OF SONGS-c-3">3</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>All through the night while I lay on my bed,</p><p>I longed for the one whom I love.</p><p>I desired for him to come,</p><p>but he did not come.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    So I said to myself,</p><p>“I will get up now and walk around the city,</p><p>through the streets and plazas,</p><p>to search for the one whom I love.”</p><p>
    So I got up and searched for him,</p><p>but I could not find him.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>The city watchmen saw me</p><p>while they were patrolling/walking around the city.</p><p>
    I asked them,</p><p>“Have you seen the one whom I love?”</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>As soon as I walked past them,</p><p>I found the one whom I love.</p><p>I clung to him and would not let him go</p><p>until I had brought him to my mother’s house,</p><p>to the room where my mother had conceived me (OR, where I was born).</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>You women of Jerusalem,</p><p>solemnly promise me, while the does and gazelles are listening, that you will not</p><p>disturb us while we are making love</p><p>until we are ready to quit.</p><p>One of their friends speaks</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Who is it that is coming from the desert,</p><p>who is stirring up dust like a column of smoke</p><p>from burning myrrh and incense</p><p>
    made from spices imported by merchants?</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>It is Solomon, sitting in his portable chair</p><p>surrounded by 60 bodyguards</p><p>chosen from the strongest/greatest warriors in Israel.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>They all have swords</p><p>and they all ◄are trained to/know well how to► use them.</p><p>Each one has his sword strapped to his side</p><p>and is prepared to defend Solomon from dangers that might occur even during the night.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>King Solomon commanded his servants to make that portable chair for him;</p><p>
    it was made with wood from Lebanon.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>The canopy that covered it was ◄held up/supported► by posts made of silver,</p><p>and the back of the chair was embroidered with gold.</p><p>The seat/cushion was covered with purple cloth</p><p>lovingly made/woven by the women of Jerusalem.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>You women of Jerusalem,</p><p>come and look at King Solomon</p><p>wearing the headdress that his mother put on his head</p><p>on the day when he was married,</p><p>the day when he [SYN] was very happy.</p><a href="#SONG OF SONGS-c-4"><h3 id="SONG OF SONGS-c-4">4</h3></a>
<p>The man speaks</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>My darling, you are beautiful,</p><p>you are very beautiful!</p><p>Underneath your veil, your eyes are as gentle as [MET] doves.</p><p>Your long black hair moves from side to side like [SIM] a flock of black goats</p><p>moving down the slopes of Gilead Mountain.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Your teeth are very white</p><p>like [SIM] a flock of sheep whose wool has just been ◄shorn/cut off►</p><p>and that have come up from being washed in a stream.</p><p>You have all of your teeth;</p><p>none of them is missing.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Your lips are like [SIM] a scarlet ribbon,</p><p>and your mouth is lovely.</p><p>Beneath your veil,</p><p>your round, rosy/red cheeks are like [SIM] the halves of a pomegranate.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Your long neck is beautiful like [SIM] the tower of King David</p><p>that was built using layers/rows of stone.</p><p>
    The ornaments on your necklaces are like 1,000 [HYP] shields that are hanging on the walls of a tower;</p><p>each one belongs to a warrior.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Your breasts are as beautiful [SIM] as two ◄fawns/young gazelles►</p><p>that eat grass among lilies.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Until dawn tomorrow morning</p><p>and the nighttime shadows/darkness disappear,</p><p>I will lie close to your breasts</p><p>that are like [MET] hills that are covered with incense [DOU].</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>My darling, you are completely beautiful;</p><p>your body is perfectly formed!</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>My bride, it is as though you are in [MET] Lebanon</p><p>
    far away, where I cannot reach you;</p><p>come back to me.</p><p>
    It is as though you are inaccessible [MET]</p><p>on the top of Hermon Mountain or the nearby peaks.</p><p>Come from where the lions have their dens</p><p>and where the leopards live on the mountains.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>My bride [DOU], you who are dearer to me than my sister, you have captured my affection [IDM]</p><p>by only once quickly looking at me,</p><p>and by one strand of jewels in your necklace.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>My bride, your love for me is delightful!</p><p>It more delightful than wine!</p><p>And the fragrance of your perfume</p><p>is more pleasing than any spice!</p><p>

    <sup>12</sup>My bride, you who are dearer to me than [MET] my sister, you are like [MET] a garden that is locked</p><p>
    in order that other men cannot enter it;</p><p>
    you are like [MET] a spring or a fountain that is covered</p><p>
    in order that others may not drink from it.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>You are like [MET] an orchard of pomegranate trees</p><p>full of delicious fruit,</p><p>and plenty of plants that produce henna and nard spices,</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>and saffron and calamus and cinnamon</p><p>and many other kinds of incense,</p><p>and myrrh and aloes</p><p>and many other fine spices.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    You are like [MET] a fountain in a garden,</p><p>
    like [MET] a spring of clear water</p><p>that flows down from the mountains of Lebanon.</p><p>The woman speaks</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    I want the north wind and the south wind to come,</p><p>and blow on my garden,</p><p>
    in order that the fragrance of the spices will spread through the air.</p><p>
    Similarly, I want the one who loves me to come and enjoy cuddling up to me</p><p>
    like [MET, EUP] someone comes into a garden and enjoys eating the fruit that grows there.</p><a href="#SONG OF SONGS-c-5"><h3 id="SONG OF SONGS-c-5">5</h3></a>
<p>The man speaks</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>My bride, you who are dearer to me than my sister,</p><p>I have come to cuddle up to you [MET, EUP];</p><p>
    it will be as though I will be gathering myrrh with my other spices,</p><p>and eating my honey and my honeycomb,</p><p>and drinking my wine and my milk.</p><p>Their friends speak</p><p>You two who love each other, enjoy your lovemaking;</p><p>enjoy all that you want to.</p><p>The woman speaks</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>I was partially asleep, but my mind was still awake.</p><p>Then I heard the one who loves me knocking at the door.</p><p>
    He said, “My darling, you who are dearer to me than my sister, my dear friend, my perfect one, my dove [MET],</p><p>open the door for me!</p><p>My hair is wet from the dew,</p><p>from the mist that has fallen during the night.”</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    But I had already taken off my robe;</p><p>I did not [RHQ] want to put it on again to open the door.</p><p>I had already washed my feet;</p><p>I did not [RHQ] want them to become dirty again.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>The one who loves me put his hand through the opening in the wall,</p><p>and I was thrilled that he was there.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>I got up to open the door for the one who loves me,</p><p>
    but first I put a lot of myrrh on my hands.</p><p>The myrrh was dripping from my fingers</p><p>while I unlatched the bolt.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>I opened the door for the man who loves me,</p><p>but he had left.</p><p>He had turned away and was gone!</p><p>I was very disappointed [IDM];</p><p>I searched for him, but I could not find him.</p><p>I called him, but he did not answer.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>The city watchmen saw me while they were walking around the city.</p><p>They beat me and wounded me</p><p>
    because they thought I must be a prostitute;</p><p>those men who were guarding the city walls took my robe.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>You young women of Jerusalem,</p><p>I plead with you,</p><p>if you see the man who loves me,</p><p>tell him [DOU] that I am very disappointed that we did not make love.</p><p>Their friends speak</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>You who are the ◄fairest/most beautiful► among women,</p><p>why do you think that the one who loves you is better than other men?</p><p>In what way is the man who loves you better than other men</p><p>with the result that you ask us to tell him that?</p><p>The woman speaks</p><p>

<p>Their friends speak to the woman</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>You who are the most beautiful of all the women,</p><p>where has the one who loves you gone?</p><p>
    If you tell us which [RHQ] direction he went,</p><p>we will go with you to search for him.</p><p>The woman speaks</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>The one who loves me has now come to me, who am like [MET, EUP] his garden,</p><p>He has come to enjoy my ◄charms/physical attractions► which are like [MET, EUP] spices,</p><p>to enjoy cuddling up to me [EUP, MET],</p><p>and kissing my lips, which are like [MET] lilies.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>I belong to the one who loves me, and the one who loves me belongs to me;</p><p>he enjoys kissing my lips</p><p>like [MET] a shepherd enjoys taking care of his sheep.</p><p>The man speaks</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>My darling, you are beautiful,</p><p>like [SIM] Tirzah the capital city of Israel and Jerusalem the capital city of Judah are beautiful;</p><p>you are as exciting [MET] as a group/battalion of troops holding up their banners.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Quit looking at me like that,</p><p>because your eyes excite me very much.</p><p>Your long black hair moves from side to side like [SIM] a flock of black goats</p><p>
    moving down the slopes of Gilead Mountain.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Your teeth are very white</p><p>like [SIM] a flock of sheep whose wool has just been shorn</p><p>and that have come up from being washed in a stream.</p><p>You have all of your teeth;</p><p>none of them is missing.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Beneath your veil,</p><p>your cheeks are like [SIM] the halves of a pomegranate.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Even if a king had 60 queens and 80 ◄concubines/slave wives►</p><p>and more young women than anyone can count,</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    none of them would be like my dove, who is perfect,</p><p>you who are your mother’s only daughter,</p><p>whom your mother considers to be very precious.</p><p>
    Other young women who see you say that you are fortunate,</p><p>and the queens and concubines recognize that you are very beautiful.</p><p>Their friends speaks</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Who is [RHQ] this woman who is as delightful as [SIM] the dawn,</p><p>as fair/delightful to look at as the light of the moon,</p><p>as exciting as a group/battalion of troops holding up their banners?</p><p>The man speaks</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>I went down to some walnut trees</p><p>to look at the new plants that were growing in the valley.</p><p>I wanted to see if the grapevines had budded</p><p>or if the pomegranate trees were blooming.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    But before I realized it,</p><p>my desire to make love caused me to be as excited as a prince riding in a chariot.</p><p>Their friends speak</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>You who are the perfect one,</p><p>come back to us, in order that we may see you!</p><p>The man speaks</p><p>Why do you want to look at this woman who is perfect,</p><p>like [SIM] you like to watch two rows/lines of people dancing?</p><a href="#SONG OF SONGS-c-7"><h3 id="SONG OF SONGS-c-7">7</h3></a>
<p>

    it is as though I, your king, am captured by your tresses.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>You whom I love, who have many charming features that attract me,</p><p>are very beautiful and pleasant/pleasing.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>You are stately like [SIM] a palm tree,</p><p>and your breasts are like [SIM] clusters/bunches of dates/fruit.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>I said to myself, “I will climb that palm tree</p><p>and take hold of those clusters of dates.”</p><p>To me, your breasts are like clusters of grapes that I can feel</p><p>and your breath is like the sweet fragrance of apples</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>and your kisses are like very good wine.</p><p>The woman speaks</p><p>My kisses [MTY] go to the one who loves me</p><p>and flow like wine over his lips and his teeth.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>I belong to the man who loves me,</p><p>and he desires me.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>You who love me, let’s go to the countryside,</p><p>and sleep among the henna bushes (OR, in one of the villages).</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>And let’s go early to the vineyards</p><p>to see if the grapevines have budded</p><p>and if there are blossoms on them that have opened,</p><p>and to see if the pomegranate trees are blooming,</p><p>and there I will make love to you.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>The mandrakes/love-apples are producing a fragrant odor,</p><p>and we are surrounded by delightful pleasures [MET, EUP],</p><p>new ones and old ones,</p><p>pleasures that I have been saving to give to you, who love me.</p><a href="#SONG OF SONGS-c-8"><h3 id="SONG OF SONGS-c-8">8</h3></a>
<p>The woman speaks</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>I wish that you were my brother</p><p>who ◄nursed at/drank milk from► my mother’s breasts when you were a baby,</p><p>
    because, if you were my brother, if I saw you when you were outside the house,</p><p>I could kiss you,</p><p>and no one would say that my doing that was wrong.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    No one would object if I led you to my mother’s house,</p><p>to where my mother, who taught me many things, lives.</p><p>I would like to take you to my mother’s house because I would like to make love to you [EUP],</p><p>
    and that would be as delightful as [MET] juice squeezed from pomegranates.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>You would put your left arm under my head</p><p>and with your right arm hold me close.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    I would say to you women of Jerusalem,</p><p>“Solemnly promise me</p><p>that you will not disturb us while we are making love</p><p>until we are ready to quit.”</p><p>Their friends speak</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Who is that woman who is coming up from the desert,</p><p>◄leaning on/clinging close to► the man who loves her?</p><p>The woman speaks</p><p>I woke you up when you were under the apple tree</p><p>at the place where your mother conceived you,</p><p>which is the same place where she gave birth to you.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Keep me close to you,</p><p>like [SIM] a seal on your heart,</p><p>
    or like [SIM] a bracelet on your arm.</p><p>Our love for each other is as powerful as death,</p><p>it is as enduring as the grave.</p><p>
    It is as though our love for each other bursts into flames</p><p>and burns like a hot fire.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Nothing can extinguish our love for each other,</p><p>not even a flood.</p><p>If a man tried to cause a woman to love him by saying he would give her everything that is in his house,</p><p>she would refuse.</p><p>Their friends speak</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>We have a younger sister,</p><p>and her breasts are still small.</p><p>So this is [RHQ] what we should do for her on the day that we promise some young man that he can marry her:</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>If her chest is flat like [MET] a wall,</p><p>we will decorate it by putting silver jewels that are like [MET] towers on it.</p><p>Or, if she is flat like [MET] a door,</p><p>we will decorate her with bits/pieces of cedar wood.</p><p>The woman speaks</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>My chest was previously flat like [MET] a wall,</p><p>
    but now my breasts are big like [SIM] towers.</p><p>So the one who loves me is delighted with me.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    King Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-Hamon,</p><p>and he rented it to people for them to take care of it.</p><p>He required each one to pay him 1,000 pieces of silver each year for the grapes that they harvested.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    But my body is like [MET] my own vineyard,</p><p>and Solomon, I am giving it to you.</p><p>
    You do not need to pay me 1,000 pieces of silver to enjoy my body,</p><p>but I will give 200 pieces of silver to those who take care of me [MET].</p><p>The man speaks to the woman</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>You are staying in the gardens</p><p>and my friends are listening to your voice;</p><p>
    so allow me to hear it, too.</p><p>The woman speaks</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>You who love me, come to me quickly;</p><p>
    run to me [MET, EUP] as fast as [SIM] a gazelle or young deer</p><p>runs across [MET] hills of spices.</p><a href="#SONG OF SONGS-h">^</a> <a href="#SONG OF SONGS-c-1">[1]</a> <a href="#SONG OF SONGS-c-2">[2]</a> <a href="#SONG OF SONGS-c-3">[3]</a> <a href="#SONG OF SONGS-c-4">[4]</a> <a href="#SONG OF SONGS-c-5">[5]</a> <a href="#SONG OF SONGS-c-6">[6]</a> <a href="#SONG OF SONGS-c-7">[7]</a> <a href="#SONG OF SONGS-c-8">[8]</a>
