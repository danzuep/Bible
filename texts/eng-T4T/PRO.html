<p>The purpose of Proverbs</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>These are the ◄proverbs/wise sayings► that come from Solomon, the King of Israel, who was the son of King David.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>◄These proverbs [PRS] can teach people/By studying these proverbs, people can learn► how to be wise</p><p>and how to obey what these proverbs teach them.</p><p>They will also help people to understand which teachings are wise.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>These proverbs [PRS] will teach you how to discipline/control yourselves,</p><p>how to conduct your lives,</p><p>and how to do what is right and just [DOU].</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>They will show people who do not yet know much how to do things that are smart.</p><p>They will show young people how to become wise and how to make good plans/decisions.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Those who are wise should also pay attention to these proverbs,</p><p>in order to become more wise,</p><p>and those who understand these teachings will receive good advice/guidance.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Then they will be able to understand the meaning of proverbs and parables/metaphors,</p><p>these wise sayings and ◄riddles/sayings that are difficult to understand►.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>If you want to be wise, you must begin by revering Yahweh.</p><p>
    Only foolish people despise wisdom and good advice/discipline.</p><p>Warnings about sinful people</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>My son, pay attention to what I, your father, am teaching you.</p><p>And do not reject what your mother teaches you.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>What we teach you will make you respected like having a lovely turban around your head</p><p>and like a beautiful necklace to put around your neck.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>My son, if sinners tempt/entice you to do what is wrong,</p><p>say “No” to them.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>They may say, “Come with us! Join us!</p><p>We will hide and then kill [MTY] someone who passes by.</p><p>We will ambush some helpless/innocent people.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>We will kill them [HYP] and get rid of them completely,</p><p>
    just like people who are buried in graves are gone forever.</p><p>While they are in good health, we will send them to the place where dead people are.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>And we will seize all the things that they own.</p><p>We will fill our houses with these things!</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    So, come with us!</p><p>Join our group!</p><p>We will share with you the things that we steal.”</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>My son, do not accompany them!</p><p>Do not walk on the roads with them!</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>They rush to do evil deeds!</p><p>They hurry to murder [MTY] people.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>It is useless to put out a ◄trap/net to catch a bird► because when a bird sees it,</p><p>
    it stays away from it.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>But those wicked people are not like the birds,</p><p>
    because they do not realize</p><p>that when they prepare to ambush someone to kill him,</p><p>they will be killed themselves!</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>That is what happens to people who eagerly try to get things by violently attacking others.</p><p>They will only destroy themselves!</p><p>Wisdom shouts in the streets</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>Wisdom [PRS] shouts to people in the streets,</p><p>and calls out to people in the ◄plazas/town squares►.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>Wisdom calls out in noisy places,</p><p>and at the entrances to cities.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    Wisdom says, “How long will you stupid people continue to enjoy doing foolish things [RHQ]?</p><p>How long will you people who ridicule God enjoy doing that [RHQ]?</p><p>How long will you foolish people refuse to know what things are right [RHQ]?</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>If you pay attention to me when I rebuke you,</p><p>I will tell you what I am thinking in my inner being;</p><p>I will give you some good advice.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>But when I called to you, you refused to listen.</p><p>I beckoned to you to come to me,</p><p>but you ignored me.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>I tried to advise you,</p><p>but you refused to listen to me.</p><p>I tried to correct you,</p><p>but you rejected what I told you.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>So now, when you are experiencing troubles/disasters,</p><p>I will laugh at you.</p><p>When things happen that cause you to be afraid,</p><p>I will make fun of you.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>When calamities strike you like a big storm,</p><p>when disasters hit you like a violent wind,</p><p>when all kinds of things distress you and give you trouble,</p><p>
    I will ridicule you!</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>
    Wisdom also says, “When foolish people call to me to help them,</p><p>I will not answer them.</p><p>They will search for me diligently/everywhere,</p><p>but they will not find me.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>They refused to know what things are right,</p><p>and they decided not to revere Yahweh.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>They would not accept my advice,</p><p>and they did not pay attention when I tried to correct them.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>So they will endure what will result [MET, DOU] from the evil way they have lived/behaved</p><p>and the evil things they have planned to do.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>Those who turn away from me are stupid/foolish;</p><p>they will die because of doing that.</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>But those who pay attention to me will live peacefully and safely,</p><p>and they will not be afraid that something will harm them.”</p><a href="#PROVERBS-c-2"><h3 id="PROVERBS-c-2">2</h3></a>
<p>The results of wisdom</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>My son, listen to what I say,</p><p>and consider my instructions to be as valuable as [MET] a treasure.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Pay attention to wisdom</p><p>and try hard to understand it.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Call out to God to get insight;</p><p>plead with him to help you to understand more of what he wants you to know.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Search eagerly for wisdom, like you would search for silver,</p><p>like you would search for a treasure that someone has hidden.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>If you do that, you will understand how to revere Yahweh,</p><p>and you will succeed in knowing God.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Yahweh is the one who gives us wisdom.</p><p>He is the one who tells us things that we need to know and understand.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>He gives good advice to those who conduct their lives as they should.</p><p>He protects [MET] those who do what is right.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>He guards those who act justly/fairly toward others,</p><p>and he watches over those who are faithful/loyal to him.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    If you ask God for wisdom, you will understand what is right and just [DOU] to do,</p><p>and you will know the right way to conduct your life,</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>because you will be wise in your inner being;</p><p>and knowing what God wants you to know will cause you to be joyful.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>If you know [PRS] how to choose what is right to do</p><p>and if you understand what God wants you to do,</p><p>God will protect you and guard you and keep you safe.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>If you are wise [PRS], you will not do what evil people do,</p><p>and you will not believe what deceitful people say.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Deceitful people have stopped acting fairly/justly toward others</p><p>and ◄walk on dark and evil paths/do what evil people do► [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>They enjoy doing what is wrong;</p><p>they like to do what is evil and to deceive people.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>They ◄walk on crooked paths/always deceive others►</p><p>and are always dishonest.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>If you are wise [PRS], you will also be saved from ◄immoral women/prostitutes►;</p><p>you will not pay attention when adulterous women try to ◄seduce/entice you by what they say.►</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Those women have left the husbands whom they married when they were young;</p><p>they have disregarded the solemn promise they made to God not to commit adultery.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>If you go into houses of women who are like that,</p><p>you will die when you are still young;</p><p>the road to their houses leads to hell.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>No man who ◄visits/sleeps with► a woman like that will again live harmoniously with his family.</p><p>He will never have a happy life again.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>If you are wise, you should behave like good men behave.</p><p>You should ◄stay on the paths that righteous people walk on/do what godly people do► [MET],</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>because only godly people will live in this land and receive God’s blessings;</p><p>
    only those who have not done wrong will stay here for a long time.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>Wicked people will be expelled from this land,</p><p>and people who are not trustworthy will be thrown {God will throw them} out of it.</p><a href="#PROVERBS-c-3"><h3 id="PROVERBS-c-3">3</h3></a>
<p>More advice to Solomon’s son</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>My son, do not forget what I have taught you.</p><p>Keep my commands in your inner being,</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>because if you obey them you will live a long time and things will go well for you</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Always faithfully love others and ◄be faithful/do what you say that you will do►;</p><p>doing those things will cause others to be pleased with you;</p><p>it will be as though you are wearing a beautiful necklace.</p><p>Keep those things in your mind/inner being.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>If you do, God and people will approve of you</p><p>and think highly of you [MTY].</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Trust in Yahweh completely,</p><p>and do not rely on what you yourself understand.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Always allow him to lead you.</p><p>If you do that, he will ◄show you the right path/direct your life►.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Do not be proud of being wise.</p><p>
    Instead, revere Yahweh</p><p>and turn away from doing evil.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>If you do that, your body will be healthy/strong;</p><p>it will be like medicine for you.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Honor Yahweh by what you do with your money;</p><p>and by giving him the first part of your harvest.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>If you do that, you will have a good harvest.</p><p>Yahweh will fill your barns with grain,</p><p>and your vats/containers will be overflowing with grape juice for making wine.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>My son, when Yahweh disciplines/corrects you, do not despise it,</p><p>and if he rebukes you, do not resent it.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    I say that because it is the people whom Yahweh loves that he corrects/reproves,</p><p>
    just like parents correct/reprove their sons whom they love.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    Yahweh is pleased with those who become wise and have good understanding.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>Being wise and having good understanding is worth more than silver,</p><p>better than gold.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>Being wise is more precious than ◄jewels/precious stones►;</p><p>there is nothing that you could desire that would be as valuable as wisdom.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>On the one hand, wisdom [PRS] enables you to live a long life,</p><p>and on the other hand, wisdom enables you to become rich and to be honored.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>If you are wise, your life will be pleasant,</p><p>and things will go well for you.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>Wisdom is like a tree that gives long life to those who eagerly take hold of it,</p><p>and Yahweh is pleased with those who hold onto it tightly.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>By his wisdom Yahweh created the earth,</p><p>and by his understanding he put everything in the skies.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>By his knowledge he caused the water that was beneath the earth to burst forth,</p><p>and he caused rain to fall from the clouds.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>My son, always keep doing things that are right and things that are smart.</p><p>If you do that,</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>you will live many years and be honored and respected {people will honor and respect you}.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>If you do what is right and wise, you will be able to walk safely,</p><p>and you will not ◄stumble/do things that are wrong► [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>You will be able to lie down at night and not be afraid of anything,</p><p>and you will sleep peacefully.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>You will not be afraid that something disastrous will happen to you</p><p>or that storms that strike the wicked will strike you,</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>because you will be confident that Yahweh will take care of you.</p><p>He will not let your foot be caught in a trap/snare.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>If you are able to help people who deserve it,</p><p>do not refuse to help them.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>If you are able to help someone you interact with,</p><p>do not say, “Come back later;</p><p>
    perhaps I can help you tomorrow.”</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>Do not make plans to harm those you interact with regularly,</p><p>
    because they live near you, and they trust you.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>If someone has not harmed you,</p><p>do not accuse him by saying that he has harmed you.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>Do not envy people who obtain things by violent actions,</p><p>and do not imitate/do what they do.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>
    I say that because Yahweh considers such people to be abominable/detestable;</p><p>but he is a friend to all those who do what is right.</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>Yahweh curses the families [MTY] of those who are wicked,</p><p>but he blesses the families of those who are good/righteous.</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>Yahweh makes fun of those who make fun of others,</p><p>but he kindly helps those who are humble.</p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>Wise people will be honored {people will honor wise people},</p><p>but foolish people will be dishonored/disgraced.</p><a href="#PROVERBS-c-4"><h3 id="PROVERBS-c-4">4</h3></a>
<p>Advice to young people</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>My children, listen to what I am teaching you.</p><p>If you pay attention, you will understand what is wise.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>What I am teaching you is good,</p><p>so do not turn away from it.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>When I was a young boy, loved by my mother,</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>my father told me, “Remember my words;</p><p>if you obey my commandments,</p><p>you will live a long time.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Obtain wisdom and understanding,</p><p>and ◄do not abandon/hold fast to► [LIT] what I have taught you.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Do not turn away from wisdom,</p><p>because if you are wise, you will be protected from all evil/danger.</p><p>If you love wisdom, wisdom [PRS] will guard you.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>The most important thing that you can do is to get wisdom.</p><p>Even if you obtain many other things,</p><p>the best thing is to know what things are wise.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>If you consider being wise to be very valuable,</p><p>
    people will think very highly of you.</p><p>If you cling to wisdom like you would cling to a woman you love,</p><p>
    many people will honor you.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>If you become wise, that will for you be like a beautiful wreath that is put {someone puts} on your head;</p><p>it will be like a king’s glorious crown.”</p><p>
    That is what my father told me.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    So now I say, “My son, heed what I say.</p><p>If you do that, you will live a good long life.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>I am teaching you the way to live wisely;</p><p>I am showing you how to act justly toward others.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>If you live wisely,</p><p>when you decide to do something, you will succeed [LIT].</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Hold fast to the things I have taught you to do,</p><p>and do not let them go.</p><p>Guard them,</p><p>because they will be the source of a good life.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>Do not do the things that wicked people do;</p><p>
    do not behave like they do;</p><p>do not even walk on the roads that evil people walk on [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>Stay away from those roads;</p><p>turn aside and walk on other roads;</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>because evil people cannot sleep if they have not done some evil deed on that day.</p><p>They cannot rest if they have not harmed someone.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>What they eat and what they drink are things that they have obtained by acting wickedly and violently.”</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>The behavior of good/righteous people is like the light that begins to shine at dawn</p><p>and then continues to shine brighter until the brightest time of day.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    But the behavior of wicked people is like deep/thick darkness.</p><p>
    Because it is very dark, they cannot see the things that cause them to stumble.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>My son, pay attention to what I am saying.</p><p>Listen to my words carefully.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>Keep them close to you;</p><p>let them penetrate your inner being,</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>because you will have [PRS] a good life and good health if you search for them and find them.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>It is very important that you be careful about what you think,</p><p>because what you think controls [MET] the things that you do.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>Do not say anything that deceives others</p><p>and never say what is not true.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>Keep looking straight ahead toward the events that are before you,</p><p>and do not turn aside.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>Plan carefully where you will go and what you will do,</p><p>and then stay on that road.</p><p>Then what you do will be right.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>Do not leave the straight road by turning to the left or to the right.</p><p>
    Do only what is right</p><p>and keep yourself from doing what is evil.</p><a href="#PROVERBS-c-5"><h3 id="PROVERBS-c-5">5</h3></a>
<p>A warning about adultery</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>My son, listen carefully to some more wise things that I will tell you.</p><p>Listen well to what I am going to teach you.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>If you do that, you will be able to choose wisely what to do,</p><p>and you will know the right things to say [MTY].</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>What an immoral woman says to you may be as sweet as honey,</p><p>and sound smoother than olive oil feels on your skin,</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>but the result of being with her will be bitter like gall</p><p>and injure you as badly, like being cut with a sharp two-edged sword.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>If you go where she goes [MTY], you will go down to where the dead people are.</p><p>Her steps will lead you straight to the grave.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>She is not concerned about the roads that lead to a long life.</p><p>She walks down a crooked path,</p><p>and she does not realize that she is on the wrong road.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>So now, my sons, listen to me.</p><p>◄Never turn aside from/always remember► [LIT] what I am about to tell you.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Run away from immoral women!</p><p>Do not go near the doors of their houses!</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>If you enter the home of one of them, you will lose your ◄self-respect/good reputation►</p><p>and that woman’s husband will not act mercifully toward you;</p><p>he will kill you and take everything that you have acquired during your life!</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Foreigners will take your money,</p><p>and all the good things that you have worked for will ◄end up in their hands/become their possessions►.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>And when you are about to die,</p><p>you will groan with severe pain</p><p>because diseases that you have gotten from being immoral will be destroying your body.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Then you will say, “I hated it when people tried to correct me.</p><p>I despised people when they reproved/rebuked me.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>I did not heed what my teachers said!</p><p>I paid no attention to those who tried to teach me something about my behavior.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    Now I am almost ruined,</p><p>and I will be disgraced in public gatherings.”</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>Like a man is refreshed by drinking water from his own well [MET],</p><p>enjoy having sex [EUP] only with your own wife.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>Like you would not waste good water by pouring it into the street,</p><p>
    you should not have sex with other women. [MET, EUP]</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Enjoy having sex only with your wife;</p><p>do not have sex with other women.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>Let your wife be a source of great pleasure to you.</p><p>◄Be happy/Enjoy sex► with the woman whom you married when you were both young.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>She is as pretty and graceful as a young female deer.</p><p>Allow her breasts to always satisfy you.</p><p>Allow her lovemaking to excite you.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>My son, do not be [RHQ] captivated/charmed by an immoral woman!</p><p>Do not fondle the breasts of another man’s wife!</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    I say that because Yahweh sees clearly everything that we do;</p><p>he knows where we are going on the roads that we walk on.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>Evil men’s sinful desires hold them fast;</p><p>their sins are like ropes that bind them.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>Evil men will die because they are unable to say “No” to their desires;</p><p>they will ◄go astray/be lost► because of the foolish things that they do.</p><a href="#PROVERBS-c-6"><h3 id="PROVERBS-c-6">6</h3></a>
<p>Warnings against foolish behavior</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>My son, if someone has borrowed money from a friend or a stranger,</p><p>and if you have promised that you will pay the money back if that person is unable to pay back the money he borrowed,</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>you may be trapped by what you have agreed to do,</p><p>
    because if the one who borrowed the money is not able to pay it back, you will have to pay it.</p><p>What you have said that you will do will be like a snare to you.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>So, my son, I will tell you what you should do to escape from your difficulty,</p><p>so that the moneylender does not get control over your wealth:</p><p>Humbly go to your friend and plead with him to cancel the agreement!</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Do not wait until tomorrow; go immediately!</p><p>Do not rest until you go and talk with him.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Save yourself,</p><p>like a deer that escapes from a deer hunter</p><p>
    or like a bird that flees from a bird hunter.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>You lazy individual, learn something from watching the ants.</p><p>Become wise from observing what they do.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>They do not have a king or a governor or any other person who rules them and forces them to work,</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    but they work hard all during the summer,</p><p>gathering and storing food to eat during the winter.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    But, you lazy loafer, how long will you continue to sleep [RHQ]?</p><p>Are you never going to get up from sleeping and go to work?</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>You sleep a for a little time; you say, “I will take just a short nap.”</p><p>You lie down and fold/lay your hands across your chest and rest;</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>and suddenly you will become poor.</p><p>It will be as though a bandit suddenly comes and takes all that you have.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    I will describe for you what worthless and evil people are like.</p><p>They constantly lie;</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>by winking their eyes and moving their feet and making signs with their fingers,</p><p>they signal to their friends what they are intending/planning to do.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>They plan to do evil things.</p><p>They constantly cause strife/trouble.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>But disasters will hit them suddenly;</p><p>they will be crushed/ruined and nothing will be able to heal them.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>There are six, maybe seven, kinds of people that Yahweh hates. They are:</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>People who show by their eyes that they are very proud;</p><p>people who lie [MTY];</p><p>people [SYN] who kill others [SYN] who have done nothing wrong;</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>people who plan to do evil deeds;</p><p>people [SYN] who run quickly to do wrong things;</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>people who easily tell lies in court;</p><p>and people who cause strife between family members.</p><p>More warnings about adultery</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>My son, obey my commands,</p><p>and do not ignore what your mother has taught you.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>Remember the things that we have said.</p><p>Those things should be like a beautiful necklace around your neck.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    If you follow our advice, it will be as though what we have taught you [PRS] will lead you, wherever you go.</p><p>When you sleep, they will protect you.</p><p>And when you wake up in the morning, they will teach/instruct you.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>These commands and what we teach you will be like a lamp to light your path [MET].</p><p>When we rebuke you and correct/punish you,</p><p>we will be showing you the road to having a good life.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>Heeding [PRS] these commands and things that we have taught you will enable you to keep away from immoral women</p><p>and from listening to the enticing words of an adulterous woman.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    Even if such a woman is beautiful and has lovely eyes, do not desire to go with her.</p><p>Do not let her persuade you to go with her ◄with her eyes/by the way she looks at you►.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    Do not forget that you can hire a prostitute for only a loaf of bread,</p><p>but if you sleep with another man’s wife, ◄it may cost you/you may lose► your life.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>Can you carry hot coals in your pocket and not be burned [RHQ]?</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>Can you walk on burning coals and not scorch/burn your feet?</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>
    No! And in the same way, anyone who ◄sleeps with/has sex with► another man’s wife will suffer for doing that.</p><p>
    He will certainly [LIT] be punished severely.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>We do not despise a thief if he steals some food because he is very hungry.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>But if he steals something and then is caught by the police,</p><p>he will have to pay back ◄seven times as much as/much more than► he stole.</p><p>He may need to sell everything that is in his house to get enough money to pay it back.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>
    But a man who commits adultery with some woman is very foolish,</p><p>
    because he is destroying his own self/soul by what he is doing.</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>
    That woman’s husband will wound him badly,</p><p>and other people will despise him.</p><p>His shame will never end.</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>Because that woman’s husband will ◄be jealous/not want anyone else to sleep with her►, he will become furious,</p><p>and when he gets revenge, he will not act mercifully toward the man who slept with his wife.</p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>And he will not accept any bribe/money, even if it is a big bribe, to ◄appease him/cause him to stop being angry►.</p><a href="#PROVERBS-c-7"><h3 id="PROVERBS-c-7">7</h3></a>
<p>More warnings about adultery</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>My son, heed my advice,</p><p>and guard my instructions as you would [MET] guard a treasure.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Obey my commands,</p><p>and as a result you will live a good life.</p><p>Consider the things that I teach you to be very precious;</p><p>guard them, just like you protect your eyes.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Tie my commands around your fingers in order that they will remind you to obey them.</p><p>Always keep them in mind [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    Love wisdom like you love your sister.</p><p>Understand what is wise,</p><p>
    and let that be as dear to you as members of your family.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>If you are wise and if you understand what is wise [PRS], you will not sleep with an immoral woman;</p><p>you will not listen to a woman who tries to entice you to sleep with her by what she says.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>One day, I was standing at the window inside my house,</p><p>and I looked outside.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>I saw some young men who did not have good sense.</p><p>Among them was a man who was very foolish.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>He crossed the street near the house of an immoral woman.</p><p>He was walking along the path toward her house</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>at twilight, when it was getting dark [DOU].</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Suddenly the woman came out to see/meet him.</p><p>She was dressed ◄seductively/like a prostitute►, wanting to persuade him to sleep with her.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>She was a loud talker, one who was rebellious;</p><p>she [SYN] never stayed at home.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>She often went into the city streets and plazas/markets,</p><p>waiting to trap some man.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    When she saw that young man, she put her arms around him and kissed him.</p><p>Then without being a bit ashamed, she said,</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>“I have some meat that is left over from a sacrifice that I made today to maintain fellowship with Yahweh;</p><p>I have fulfilled/done what I promised him that I would do.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>And now I have come out to meet/see you.</p><p>I was searching for you, and now I have found you!</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>I have put on my bed sheets/bedspreads that were made from very fine linen that were imported {people brought} from Egypt.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>I have sprinkled sweet-smelling perfumes on my bed—</p><p>myrrh and aloes and cinnamon.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>Come with me; let us enjoy having sex until tomorrow morning.</p><p>Let’s enjoy making love.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>My husband is not at home;</p><p>he has gone away on a long journey.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>He is carrying a wallet filled with money,</p><p>and he will not return until the middle of this month.”</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    So she persuaded him by her enticing/tempting words.</p><p>She allured him by her smooth/sweet talk.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    And he went with her immediately,</p><p>like an ox that was going to where it would be slaughtered,</p><p>or like a deer (OR, a fool) that is stepping into a noose/trap,</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>where it will remain/stay until someone shoots an arrow into its liver and kills it.</p><p>
    He was like a bird that flew into a trap.</p><p>He did not know that ◄it would cost him his life/he would die as a result►.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>My son, listen to what I say;</p><p>pay careful attention to my words.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>Do not allow anything to arouse/persuade you to go with an immoral woman like that.</p><p>Do not go where she goes.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>She has caused many men to be ruined;</p><p>truly, no one can count the men she has killed.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>The road to her house is the road to the grave.</p><p>Those who enter her bedroom [PRS] will die as a result.</p><a href="#PROVERBS-c-8"><h3 id="PROVERBS-c-8">8</h3></a>
<p>Wisdom calls to us</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>It is as if wisdom, with great understanding of many things, is calling [PRS] out to people.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Wisdom stands on hilltops and at crossroads.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    Wisdom also stands at the city gates and shouts loudly,</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>“I am calling to everyone!</p><p>I am shouting loudly to all people!</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>You people who do not know how to do things that are smart to do, get sound judgment;</p><p>you foolish people, get good understanding!</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Listen to me, because I have some excellent/important things to say.</p><p>What I say is what is fair/right.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>I speak what is true;</p><p>I detest speaking [MTY] what is false/deceptive.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Everything that I say is honest;</p><p>there is nothing that I say that deceives people.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>My words are clear to those who have good sense;</p><p>those who are wise know that what I say is right.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    If someone offers you the kind of teaching I give or offers you silver,</p><p>choose my teaching.</p><p>
    If he offers to show you how to be wise or offers you gold,</p><p>choose to know how to be wise,</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>because wisdom is more valuable than jewels.</p><p>Nothing that you desire is as valuable as being wise.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>I, wisdom, and understanding of what is smart to do, cannot be separated.</p><p>We are like two people who live in the same house.</p><p>I know how to be wise and how to make smart decisions.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    All the people who revere Yahweh hate evil.</p><p>I, wisdom, hate people who are proud and people who think they are more important than others.</p><p>I hate people who  behave in an evil way and those who say things to deceive others.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>I give people good advice and I enable them to do things that are wise.</p><p>I understand how things really are, and I am strong.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>When kings are wise, they rule well;</p><p>and when rulers are wise, they make laws that are just/fair.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>Rulers govern their people with the help of me, wisdom,</p><p>and those who have authority decide things fairly/just with my help.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>I, wisdom, love all those who love me,</p><p>and all those who truly seek me will find me.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>I enable people to become rich and to be honored;</p><p>
    I enable them to have wealth that will last and to be successful.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>What I can give people is more valuable than fine/pure gold and the best silver.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>I always do what is righteous and just/fair.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>I give wealth to those who love me;</p><p>I fill their houses with valuable things.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>Yahweh created me, wisdom, when he began to create the world;</p><p>he created me to do my work before he created anything else.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>He appointed me long ago, before he created the earth.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>I was born before the oceans were created,</p><p>when there were no springs from which water flowed.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>I was born before the hills and mountains were formed;</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    I, wisdom, was born before Yahweh made the earth,</p><p>before he made the fields and the soil on the earth.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>I was there when Yahweh put the sky in place,</p><p>when he marked the place in the distance where the sky and the oceans seem to come together.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>I was there when Yahweh put the clouds above the earth</p><p>and when he caused the water that is inside the earth to be secure.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>I was there when he fixed a boundary for the seas,</p><p>so that the water in the seas would not go past those boundaries,</p><p>and when he put down the foundations which support the earth.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>I was at the side of Yahweh, the master worker (OR, as though I was his child).</p><p>I caused him to be happy every day, and I was always rejoicing when I was with him.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>I was delighted with the world that he created;</p><p>I was happy with the people whom he created, too.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>So, you people who are like my sons, listen to me.</p><p>
    I am pleased with all those who obey my teachings.</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>Listen carefully to what I teach you and become wise.</p><p>Do not reject my teaching!</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>
    I am pleased with those who listen to me,</p><p>those who are outside my house every day, waiting for me to come out.</p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>Those who find me will have a long life,</p><p>and Yahweh will be pleased with them.</p><p>
    <sup>36</sup>But those who stray away from me just harm themselves.</p><p>All those who hate me, it is as though [IRO] they are loving death.”</p><a href="#PROVERBS-c-9"><h3 id="PROVERBS-c-9">9</h3></a>
<p>Being wise and being foolish</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    It is as though wisdom is a woman who has built a big house for herself,</p><p>and has set up seven columns to support the roof,</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>and has slaughtered an animal and cooked the meat,</p><p>and has mixed nice spices in the wine,</p><p>and has put the food on the table.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    It is as though then she sent out her servant women to call out from the highest place in the town,</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>“You people who need to understand more, come in!”</p><p>And to those who are ignorant, it is as though she calls out,</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>“Come and eat the food that I have prepared,</p><p>and drink the good wine that I have mixed!</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>◄Leave/Go away from► other foolish people, and if you do that, you will continue to live.</p><p>Walk on the road that will enable you to ◄have knowledge/know what is true and what is not true►.”</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>If you rebuke someone who will not allow others to correct him, he will insult you.</p><p>If you reprove/scold an evil man, he will hurt you.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Do not rebuke someone who will not allow others to ◄correct him/tell him what he has done is wrong►, because he will hate you for doing that.</p><p>
    But if you rebuke a wise person, he will respect you.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>If you give instruction to wise people, they will become wiser.</p><p>And if you teach righteous people, they will learn more.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>If you want to be wise, you must start by revering Yahweh,</p><p>and if you know God, the Holy One, you will understand which teachings are wise/true.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>If you become wise, you will live many years [DOU].</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>If you are wise, you are the one who will benefit from it;</p><p>if you ridicule becoming wise, you are the one who will suffer.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Foolish women talk loudly;</p><p>they are ignorant and are never ashamed of the wrong things that they do.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>They sit at the doors of their houses</p><p>
    or they sit on the top of the hills in the town,</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>and they call out to the men who are passing by,</p><p>who are trying to be concerned with their own affairs,</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>“You people who need to understand more, come into my house!”</p><p>And to those who are ignorant, they call out,</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>“Just as water which you have stolen tastes very good</p><p>and food that you eat by yourself tastes the best,</p><p>
    if you have sex secretly with someone to whom you are not married, you will enjoy it very much.”</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>But men who go to those women’s houses do not know that those who have gone there are now dead;</p><p>they have descended down into the deepest parts of the place where dead people are.</p><a href="#PROVERBS-c-10"><h3 id="PROVERBS-c-10">10</h3></a>
<p>Wise sayings from Solomon</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>These are more proverbs/wise sayings from Solomon:</p><p>If children are wise, they cause their parents to be happy;</p><p>but if children are foolish, they cause their parents to be very sad.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Money that you get by doing dishonest/wicked things will really not benefit you;</p><p>but by living righteously you will live for ◄a long time/many years►.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Yahweh does not allow righteous people to starve,</p><p>but he will prevent wicked people from getting what they want.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Lazy people soon become poor;</p><p>it is those who work hard who become rich.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Those who are wise, harvest the crops when they are ripe;</p><p>it is shameful/disgraceful to sleep and not work during harvest time.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Righteous people will be blessed by God;</p><p>
    the nice things that wicked people say [MTY] sometimes conceal the fact that they are planning to act violently.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>After righteous people die, other people are blessed as they remember what those people did before they died;</p><p>but we will soon forget wicked people [MTY] after they die.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Wise people heed good instruction/advice,</p><p>but people who talk foolishly will ruin themselves.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Honest people will be safe,</p><p>but others (OR, God) will find out those who are dishonest.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Those who signal with their eyes that they are about to do something that is wrong cause trouble,</p><p>but those who rebuke others truthfully cause them to be peaceful.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>What righteous people say [MTY] is like a fountain that ◄gives life/enables people to live many years► [MET],</p><p>but what wicked people say [MTY] hides the fact that they intend to act violently.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>When we hate others, it causes quarrels,</p><p>but if we love others, we forgive them for the wrong things that they do.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Those who have good sense say [MTY] what is wise,</p><p>but people who do not have good sense must be punished.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>Wise people continue to learn all that they can,</p><p>but when foolish people speak, they soon cause trouble.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>The wealth that rich people have protects them like a city is protected by a strong wall around it [MET],</p><p>but people who are poor suffer much because they have no one to help them.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>If you are righteous, your reward will be a good life,</p><p>
    but all that sinful people gain is to sin more.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Those who pay attention when others try to ◄correct them/teach them what they are doing that is wrong► will live ◄happily/for many years►;</p><p>but those who reject being rebuked will not find the road to life (OR, cause others to go astray).</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>Those who will not admit that they hate others are liars,</p><p>and those who slander others are foolish.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>When people talk a lot, that will lead them to sin a lot by what they say;</p><p>if you are wise, you will refuse to say very much.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>What righteous/good people say [MTY] is as valuable as pure silver [MET];</p><p>what wicked people think is worthless.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>What righteous people say [MTY] benefits many people,</p><p>but foolish people die because of the stupid things that they do.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>Yahweh blesses some people by enabling them to become rich,</p><p>and working hard will not make them to become richer (OR, and he will not also cause them to become sad).</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>Foolish people ◄have fun/enjoy► doing what is wrong,</p><p>but wise/sensible people enjoy doing what is wise.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>Righteous people will get the good things that they want/desire,</p><p>but what wicked people are afraid of is what will happen to them.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>When storms come, the wicked will ◄be blown away/never be safe►,</p><p>but righteous people will be safe forever.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>We do not like a lazy person who refuses to do the job that he is given to do,</p><p>
    just like we do not like vinegar in our mouths or smoke in our eyes.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>If you revere Yahweh, you will live for a long time;</p><p>but wicked people die before they become old.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>Righteous people confidently expect that good things will happen to them, and that causes them to be happy/joyful;</p><p>but when wicked people confidently expect something good to happen, it does not happen.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>Yahweh protects [MET] those who live righteously,</p><p>but he destroys those who do what is evil.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>Righteous people will always be secure [LIT],</p><p>but wicked people will be removed from their land (OR, from this earth).</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>Righteous people [MTY] say things that are wise,</p><p>but God will shut the mouths of people [MTY] who say what is not true.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>Righteous people [MTY] know what to say that is acceptable,</p><p>but wicked people [MTY] are constantly saying things that are not true.</p><a href="#PROVERBS-c-11"><h3 id="PROVERBS-c-11">11</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh detests people who use scales that do not weigh correctly;</p><p>he is delighted with those who use correct weights on the scales.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    People who are proud will eventually be disgraced;</p><p>it is wise to be humble.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    People who are good are guided by doing what is honest;</p><p>those who are not honest will be ruined because of the wrong things that they do.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    Your money will not help you on the day that God judges and punishes people;</p><p>but if you live righteously, you will live a long time.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>When people are honest and good, that will ◄direct their paths/show them what is right for them to do►;</p><p>but wicked people will experience disasters because of the evil things that they do.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    God rescues/protects righteous people because they ◄are honest/do what is right►,</p><p>but those who ◄are treacherous/cannot be trusted► will be trapped because of their being greedy.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>When wicked people die, they cannot confidently expect to receive anything that is good;</p><p>they expect that their money will help/save them, but it will not.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    Yahweh rescues righteous people from their troubles/difficulties;</p><p>instead, it is the wicked who will have troubles.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Godless people can ruin others by what they say [MTY],</p><p>but righteous people will be saved by their ◄own good sense/being wise►.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>When things go well for righteous people, the people in [MTY] their city are happy,</p><p>and they shout joyfully when wicked people die.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>When righteous people request God to bless a city, that city will become great,</p><p>but cities are ruined by what wicked people say [MTY].</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>It is foolish to despise others;</p><p>those who ◄have good sense/are wise► do not say anything to criticize others.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Those who ◄spread gossip/tell bad things about others► will tell your secrets to others,</p><p>but if there is someone whom you can trust, you can trust him to not tell your secrets to others.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>A nation will be destroyed/ruined if it does not have leaders who guide it wisely;</p><p>but if there are many good advisors, the nation remains secure.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>If you promise a stranger that you will pay his debt if he cannot pay it himself, you will regret it.</p><p>You will be safe if you refuse to guarantee that you will pay someone else’s debts.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    People honor/respect women who are kind/gracious;</p><p>ruthless/violent people may get a lot of money, but that is all that they will get.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Those who are kind benefit themselves because others will be kind to them,</p><p>but those who are cruel will hurt themselves because others will be cruel to them.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>If wicked people earn a lot of money, that will deceive them because they will not keep it for very long,</p><p>but those who do what is right will surely be rewarded by God forever.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Those who always do what is right will live a long/happy life,</p><p>but those who insist on doing what is wrong will not live very long.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>Yahweh hates those who are always thinking about doing evil things,</p><p>but he is delighted with those who always do what is right.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>It is certain that Yahweh will punish evil people</p><p>and that righteous people will escape from being punished.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    It is ◄unsuitable/not proper/disgusting► for a beautiful woman not to know what is right to do,</p><p>like [SIM] it is unsuitable/disgusting for a pig to have a gold ring in its snout/nose.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>When the things that righteous people want happen, it brings good to them and to others,</p><p>but when the wicked get what they want, it causes everyone else to become angry.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>Some people give their money generously to poor people, but they become richer in spite of that,</p><p>and some people hold tightly to their money, but they still become poor in spite of that.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>Those who give generously to others will prosper;</p><p>if you help others, they/someone will help you, too.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>People curse/despise someone who hoards his grain and does not sell it, waiting to get a higher/bigger price for it,</p><p>but they praise someone who sells it when people need it, even when the price is not high.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>If you sincerely want to do what is right, people will respect you,</p><p>but if you are wanting to cause trouble, trouble is what you will get.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>Those who trust in their money will disappear like the withered leaves that fall from the trees,</p><p>but righteous people will keep going strong, like green leaves in the summer.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>Those who bring troubles to their families will inherit nothing [MET] from them,</p><p>and those who do foolish things like that will some day become the servants of wise people.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>Those who live righteously will live for a long time,</p><p>but those who act violently will destroy their own lives (OR, those who are wise will have many people come and live with them).</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>
    Sometimes righteous people are rewarded here on the earth,</p><p>but it is much more certain that very wicked people [DOU] will be rewarded by being punished.</p><a href="#PROVERBS-c-12"><h3 id="PROVERBS-c-12">12</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>Those who want to know what is right to do want to be ◄disciplined/corrected► when they do what is wrong;</p><p>it is foolish to not want to be ◄corrected/told that what you did is wrong►.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Yahweh is pleased with good people,</p><p>but he condemns those who plan to harm others.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>People do not become secure/safe by doing what is wicked;</p><p>righteous people will be very safe and secure [LIT] like [MET] a tree that has deep roots.</p><p>

    <sup>18</sup>
    If someone borrows money from another person, it is foolish for you to promise [IDM] that you will pay the money back</p><p>if that other person is unable to pay back the money that he borrowed.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Those who like to sin also like to cause strife/trouble;</p><p>
    and those who build fancy doors in their houses to show that they are very wealthy (OR, speak proudly) are inviting disaster.</p><p>

    <sup>21</sup>Children who are foolish soon cause their parents to be very sad;</p><p>their parents will not be joyful at all.</p><p>

    <sup>25</sup>Children who are foolish cause their father to be sad</p><p>and also cause their mother to be very sorrowful.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>It is not right to force someone who has done nothing wrong to pay a fine;</p><p>it is wrong to punish good/respected people.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>Those who have good sense do not talk a lot,</p><p>and those who ◄control their tempers/keep themselves from becoming very angry► are truly wise.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>People may think that foolish people who do not say anything are wise;</p><p>if foolish people ◄do not say anything/keep their mouths shut►, others will think that they are very intelligent.</p><a href="#PROVERBS-c-18"><h3 id="PROVERBS-c-18">18</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>Those who separate themselves from other people think only about those things that they are interested in;</p><p>

    <sup>4</sup>What wise people say is like a deep ocean that you can never get to the bottom of [MET],</p><p>and it refreshes us like water from a rapidly flowing stream.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>It is not good for a judge to decide matters in favor of those who ◄are guilty/have done wicked things►</p><p>and to not do what is just for those who ◄are innocent/have not done what is wrong►.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>When foolish people [SYN] start arguments,</p><p>
    it is as though they [SYN] are requesting/inviting someone to flog/whip them.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>What foolish people [MTY] say causes them to be ruined;</p><p>their own words are like a trap [MET] that catches/seizes them.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    People enjoy listening to what gossips say like [SIM] they enjoy tasty food;</p><p>they accept what gossips tell them like [MET] they swallow tasty food.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>People who are lazy while they work</p><p>are just as bad as [IDM] those who destroy things.</p><p>

    <sup>16</sup>If you take a gift to an important person, that will open the way to allow you to talk to him.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>The first person to present his case in court seems right,</p><p>but when ◄someone else/his opponent► begins to ask him questions, it may become clear that what he said was not true.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>If two influential/important people are arguing,</p><p>
    someone can settle the matter by ◄casting lots/throwing marked stones to decide who is right►.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>If you help relatives, they will protect you like [SIM] a strong wall protects a city,</p><p>but if you quarrel with them, that will separate you from them like bars on a city gate separate the city from those who want to enter it [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>People are happy when they hear others say [MTY] something that is good,</p><p>
    like they are happy when they eat food that is good [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>What you say can cause others to be killed or it can cause them to continue to live;</p><p>
    so those who like to talk a lot must ◄accept the consequences/realize that what they say can cause much harm►.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>If you marry a good woman, that is like finding a wonderful thing;</p><p>
    it shows that Yahweh is pleased with you.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    It is necessary for poor people to speak politely when they request rich people to do something for them,</p><p>but rich people reply very impolitely when poor people speak to them.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>There are some people who only pretend to be friends with us,</p><p>but there are some friends who are more loyal than members of our families.</p><a href="#PROVERBS-c-19"><h3 id="PROVERBS-c-19">19</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>Conducting our lives as we should even though we are poor</p><p>is better than being foolish and telling lies.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Being enthusiastic but not thinking carefully about what we are about to do is not good;</p><p>doing things hastily can cause us a lot of trouble [IDM].</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Some people are ruined as a result of their own foolish actions,</p><p>and when that happens, they [SYN] angrily say that it is Yahweh’s fault.</p><p>

    <sup>5</sup>Those who tell lies in court will surely be punished [LIT];</p><p>they will not escape it.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Many people try to persuade important people to do favors for them;</p><p>everyone wants to be a friend of those who give gifts.</p><p>

    even if he tries to talk with them, they will not be his friends again.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Those who become wise [IDM] are doing a favor for themselves;</p><p>those who get good sense will prosper.</p><p>

    <sup>10</sup>It is not appropriate for foolish people to live ◄luxuriously/like rich people►,</p><p>and it is even less appropriate for slaves to rule important officials.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Those who have good sense do not quickly become angry;</p><p>people respect those who ignore offensive things that people say to them.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>When a king is angry, that causes people to be afraid of him, like the roar of a lion causes people to be afraid [SIM],</p><p>but if he acts kindly toward people, they like it just like they like dew on the grass in the morning.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Foolish children can cause disasters to happen to their parents.</p><p>A wife who constantly ◄nags/quarrels with► her husband is as annoying as water that continually drips [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>We can inherit a house or money from our parents when they die,</p><p>but only Yahweh can give someone a sensible wife.</p><p>

    <sup>17</sup>When we give things to poor people, it is as though we are lending to Yahweh,</p><p>and he will ◄pay us back/reward us for what we did►.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>Discipline your children while they are young, while you still hope that they will learn to behave as they should;</p><p>
    if you do not discipline them, you are helping them to destroy themselves.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Those who ◄do not control their temper/quickly become very angry► will have to endure what happens as a result;</p><p>
    but if we rescue them from those troubles once, we will have to continue rescuing them.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>Pay attention when people give you good advice and learn from them,</p><p>in order that you will become wise for the rest of your life.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>People plan to do many kinds of things,</p><p>but what will happen is what Yahweh has decided will happen.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>People want others to be loyal to them;</p><p>it is better to be poor than to tell a lie to a judge in court in order to get money.</p><p>

    <sup>28</sup>Worthless witnesses in court make fun of judges who try to make fair decisions,</p><p>and wicked people enjoy doing evil like they enjoy eating good food [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>
    God is ready to punish those who make fun of him/religion;</p><p>those who do foolish things deserve to be flogged/whipped.</p><a href="#PROVERBS-c-20"><h3 id="PROVERBS-c-20">20</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>Drinking a lot of wine or other strong drinks causes people to start fighting;</p><p>it is foolish to become drunk/intoxicated.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Being afraid of a king when he is angry is like [SIM] being afraid of a lion when it growls/roars;</p><p>if you cause the king to become angry, he may execute you.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    People respect those who stay away from disputes/arguments;</p><p>foolish people love to quarrel.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    If a lazy man does not plow his fields at the right/proper time,</p><p>he will look for crops at harvest time, but there will be nothing there.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Just as it is difficult to bring up water from a deep well, it is difficult to know what people are thinking,</p><p>but someone who has good sense/insight will be able to find out what people are thinking.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Many people proclaim that they can be trusted to do what they say that they will do,</p><p>but it is very difficult to find [RHQ] someone who can really be trusted.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>If parents conduct their lives as they should,</p><p>
    God blesses their children (OR, their children are very happy/fortunate).</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>A king who sits on his throne to judge people</p><p>can easily [MTY] find out what things that people have done are good and what things are evil.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>There is no one [RHQ] who can truthfully say, “I do not know of any wrong things that I have done;</p><p>I have ◄gotten rid of all my sinful behavior/quit doing what is sinful►.”</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Yahweh detests people who use weights that are not right</p><p>and measures that are not correct.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Even children show by what they do whether they are good or not;</p><p>they show whether ◄what they do/their behavior► is honest and right or not.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Two of the things that Yahweh has created for us</p><p>are ears to hear things and eyes to see things.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>If you want to sleep all the time, you will become poor;</p><p>if you stay awake and work, you will have plenty of food.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>People look at things that they are about to buy, and in order to get it for a lower price sometimes they say, “◄It is no good/It is poor quality►,”</p><p>but after they buy it, they go and boast about having bought it for a cheap price.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>Gold and precious stones are valuable,</p><p>but wise words [MTY] are more valuable.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>If you foolishly promise to a stranger that you will pay what he owes if he is unable to pay it [DOU],</p><p>
    you deserve to have someone take your coat from you.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>People may think that food that they acquire by doing what is dishonest will taste very good,</p><p>but later they will not enjoy what they have done any more than they would enjoy eating gravel/sand.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>When people give you good advice, if you do what they suggest, your plans will succeed;</p><p>so be sure to get good advice from wise people before you start fighting a war.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Those who go around telling gossip are always telling secrets to others;</p><p>so stay away from people who foolishly talk too much.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>If someone curses his father or his mother,</p><p>his life will be ended, just like a lamp is extinguished.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>If you very quickly take the property that your parents promise will be yours after they die,</p><p>you will not receive any good/blessing from it.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>Do not say, “I will do evil to those who do evil to me;”</p><p>wait for Yahweh to do something about it, and he will ◄help you/do what is right►.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>Yahweh detests those who use dishonest scales</p><p>and weights that are not accurate/correct.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>Yahweh is the one who has decided what will happen to us,</p><p>so ◄how can we &lt;understand/know&gt; what will happen before it happens?/we humans certainly cannot &lt;understand/know&gt; what will happen before it happens.► [RHQ]</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>You should think carefully before you solemnly promise to dedicate something to God,</p><p>because later you might be sorry you have promised to do it.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>Wise kings find out [MET] which people have done what is wrong,</p><p>and they punish them very severely [IDM].</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>Our consciences are like lamps that Yahweh has given to us to enable us to know what we are thinking [MET];</p><p>they reveal what is hidden deep in our ◄minds/inner beings►.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>Kings will continue to rule as long as they faithfully love their people and are loyal to them</p><p>and as long as they rule righteously/fairly.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>We honor/admire young people because they are strong,</p><p>but we respect [MTY] old people more because they are wise.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>When we are beaten or whipped, it can cause us to quit doing what is evil in our lives;</p><p>when someone wounds us by punishing us, it can cause our behavior to become good.</p><a href="#PROVERBS-c-21"><h3 id="PROVERBS-c-21">21</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh controls what kings do [MTY] like he controls how streams flow;</p><p>he causes kings to do just what he wants them to do.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>People always think that what they do is right,</p><p>but Yahweh judges our ◄motives/reasons for doing things► [MTY].</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Doing what is right and fair is more acceptable to Yahweh</p><p>than bringing sacrifices to him.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Being proud and arrogant [DOU] is like a lamp [MTY] that guides wicked people;</p><p>being proud and arrogant characterizes ◄wicked people’s whole behavior/everything that wicked people do►.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>People who plan carefully will surely have plenty of what they need;</p><p>those who act too quickly to become rich will become poor.</p><p>

    <sup>7</sup>Wicked people refuse to do what is right/just,</p><p>but they will be ruined because of the violent things [PRS] that they do.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Guilty people continually do what is evil; it is as though [MET] they are walking on a crooked road;</p><p>but righteous/innocent people always do what is right.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>It is better to live in the corner of an attic/housetop by yourself</p><p>than to live inside the house with a wife who is always nagging.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Wicked people [SYN] are always wanting to do what is evil;</p><p>they never act mercifully toward anyone.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>When those who ridicule others are punished, even those who do not have good sense see that, and they become wise,</p><p>and when those who are wise are taught, they become wiser.</p><p>

    <sup>13</sup>There are people who refuse to listen when poor people cry out for help;</p><p>
    but some day they themselves will cry out for help, and no one will hear them.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>When someone is angry with you,</p><p>if you secretly give him a gift, he will stop being angry.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>Good/Righteous people are happy when they see others do what is just/fair,</p><p>but those who do what is evil are terrified when they think about what may happen to them.</p><p>

    <sup>21</sup>Those who always try to act in a fair and kind way toward others</p><p>will live a long time and be honored/respected.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>A wise army commander helps his troops climb over a wall to attack a city that is defended by a strong army,</p><p>with the result that they are able to ◄get over/destroy► the high walls that their enemies trusted would protect them.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>Those who are very careful about what they say [MTY]</p><p>are able to avoid trouble.</p><p>

    <sup>26</sup>All during the day wicked people desire to obtain things,</p><p>but righteous people have plenty, with the result that they are able to give things generously to others.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>

    <sup>3</sup>Those who have good sense realize that there is something dangerous ahead, and they avoid it;</p><p>those who do not have good sense just keep going and later they will suffer because of doing that.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>The reward that Yahweh gives to those who are humble and who revere him</p><p>is that he causes them to be rich and honored and to live for a long time.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Because of the things that wicked people do, they have difficulties/troubles that will be like thorns and traps on the roads that they walk on [MET];</p><p>people who are careful/cautious will be able to stay away from those difficulties.</p><p>

    It is easy to rob poor people who are helpless and cannot defend themselves, but never do that;</p><p>and do not oppress in court those who are needy/afflicted,</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>because Yahweh will speak to defend them,</p><p>and he will punish those who steal things from others—by causing them to die.</p><p>-2-</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>Do not become friends with those who often become angry,</p><p>and do not associate with those who cannot control their temper/anger,</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>because you might start to act like they do</p><p>and not be able to stop doing that.</p><p>-3-</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>If someone borrows money,</p><p>do not be one of those who promises to pay what that person owes</p><p>he cannot pay it back,</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>because if you cannot pay it back,</p><p>people will surely [RHQ] come and take away everything you own, even your bed.</p><p>-4-</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>Do not steal some of your neighbors’ land by removing the boundary lines/markers that your ancestors placed/set.</p><p>-5-</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>Know/Learn [RHQ] this about those who do their work very skillfully:</p><p>They will quit working for ordinary people</p><p>and will start working for kings</p><p>
    because the kings will want people like that to work for them.</p><a href="#PROVERBS-c-23"><h3 id="PROVERBS-c-23">23</h3></a>

    <sup>1</sup>When you sit down to eat a meal with a ◄government official/king►,</p><p>think carefully about what (OR, who) is in front of you.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    Even if you ◄have a big appetite/want to eat a lot of food►,</p><p>restrain yourself.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Do not want to eat a lot of his fine food,</p><p>because he may be trying to trick you.</p><p>-7-</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Do not cause yourself to become very tired by working very hard to become rich;</p><p>be wise and stop doing that,</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>because as soon as you look [MTY] at all the money that you have acquired, it will be gone;</p><p>it will disappear as if it suddenly grew wings [SIM]</p><p>and flew up into the sky like an eagle.</p><p>-8-</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    If someone who is stingy invites you to a meal,</p><p>do not eat a lot of his fine food,</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>because he will be thinking about how much the food cost that you are eating.</p><p>He will say to you, “Eat and drink all that you want!”, but that is not what he will really be thinking.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    When you realize what he is really thinking, it will cause you to want to vomit what you have eaten;</p><p>and your kind words telling him that you are enjoying the meal will be wasted.</p><p>-9-</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>◄Do not waste time by/It is useless► talking to foolish people;</p><p>they will only despise the wise things that you say.</p><p>-10-</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Do not steal someone’s property by removing a boundary marker that has been there for a long time,</p><p>and do not take for yourself the land that belongs to orphans,</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>because Yahweh is strong, and he is like a relative that has the responsibility to defend them,</p><p>he will stand up in court and argue for them and against you.</p><p>-11-</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Pay attention to what your teachers teach you,</p><p>and try to learn from the wise things that they say.</p><p>-12-</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Do not refuse to discipline your children;</p><p>if you punish/spank them, it will not cause them to die,</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>and it may save them from going to the place where dead people are.</p><p>-13-</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>My son/child, if you [SYN] become wise,</p><p>I [SYN] will be very happy.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>I [SYN] will rejoice when I hear you [SYN] say what is right/wise.</p><p>-14-</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Do not envy sinful people;</p><p>instead, revere Yahweh all of your life.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    If you do that, you will be happy in the future,</p><p>and God will certainly do for you what you are confidently expecting him to do.</p><p>-15-</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>My son/child, listen carefully to me and become wise,</p><p>and think about ◄all that you do/your behavior►.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>Do not associate with those who drink a lot of ◄wine/strong drink►</p><p>or with those who ◄are gluttons/eat more than they should►,</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>because drunkards and gluttons will become poor;</p><p>and if all that you do is eat and sleep, you will soon ◄be wearing rags/not have any money to buy clothes►.</p><p>-16-</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>Pay attention to what your father tells you,</p><p>and ◄do not neglect/take care of► [LIT] your mother when she is old.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>Try to know/learn what is wise, and get good instruction and understanding;</p><p>and do not throw those things away.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>Righteous children will cause their parents to be very happy;</p><p>those whose children are wise are proud of them.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    Do what will cause your father to be glad</p><p>and enable your mother also to be happy.</p><p>17</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>My son, heed what I say to you,</p><p>and allow what I do to be an example for you.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>Prostitutes and immoral women [DOU] are like [MET] a deep pit</p><p>or a well that you may fall into.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>They wait for you like robbers [SIM],</p><p>and they cause many men to ◄be unfaithful to/have sex with women who are not► their wives.</p><p>-18-</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>I will tell you [RHQ] what kind of people are always miserable and sad.</p><p>I will tell you [RHQ] which people are always causing arguments/quarrels and who are always complaining.</p><p>I will tell you [RHQ] who are injured in fights</p><p>and whose eyes are always red/bloodshot.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>
    It is those who drink a lot of wine,</p><p>who try drinking other kinds of strong drinks.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>Do not look with pleasure at red wine that looks nice, and which sparkles when it is poured out into cups,</p><p>and which tastes good as you drink it,</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>because the next morning you will feel like you have been bitten by a poisonous snake [DOU].</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>You [SYN] will think that you are seeing strange/weird things,</p><p>and you [SYN] will not be able to think clearly or speak clearly.</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>You will think you are in a ship that is tossing on the sea;</p><p>you be like [SIM] someone who is trying to sleep when the ship is rolling from one side to the other.</p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>You will say, “I think that someone struck me, but he did not hurt me;</p><p>he hit me, but I did not feel it.</p><p>When will I ◄wake up/feel normal again►</p><p>in order that I can drink some more wine?”</p><a href="#PROVERBS-c-24"><h3 id="PROVERBS-c-24">24</h3></a>

    <sup>1</sup>Do not envy evil people;</p><p>do not desire to associate with them,</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>because they are constantly thinking about acting violently,</p><p>and whenever they speak [MTY], they talk about ◄causing trouble/hurting someone►.</p><p>-20-</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>People make good houses (OR, families) by doing what is wise,</p><p>and they make their houses (OR, families) strong by heeding good advice.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>By using good sense, they are able to buy valuable and beautiful things and put them in the rooms of their houses.</p><p>-21-</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Being wise is better than being strong/powerful;</p><p>those who know many things can accomplish more than those who are very strong.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Leaders can fight battles if they have wise advisors,</p><p>and they win those battles if they have many good advisors.</p><p>-22-</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Foolish people cannot understand wise sayings/talk;</p><p>at public meetings they are not able to say anything that is useful.</p><p>-23-</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Those who are always planning to do evil things will be called troublemakers.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>It is sinful to plan to do foolish things,</p><p>and people hate those who make fun of everything that is good.</p><p>-24-</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>If you act as though you are helpless when you have troubles,</p><p>you are truly very weak.</p><p>-25-</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    If it is unjustly decided that someone must be executed, try hard to rescue them [DOU].</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>If you say, “I did not know anything about it, so ◄it is not my concern/I did not try to help him►,”</p><p>remember that God knows what we have done,</p><p>and he knows what we were thinking [IDM, RHQ],</p><p>and he will certainly [RHQ] repay us as we deserve for what we have done or for not doing what we should have done.</p><p>-26-</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>My child/son, eat honey, because it is good for you;</p><p>the honey that drips from honeycombs tastes very sweet.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>Similarly, being wise is good for your soul;</p><p>if you become wise,</p><p>you will be happy in the future,</p><p>and God will certainly do for you what you are confidently expecting him to do [LIT].</p><p>-27-</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>Do not be like wicked people who hide and wait to break into the houses of righteous/good people</p><p>and rob/steal things.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    Even if good people fall down seven/many times,</p><p>they always stand/get up again,</p><p>but when a disaster happens to wicked people,</p><p>it ruins/destroys them.</p><p>-28-</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Do not be happy when something bad happens to one of your enemies;</p><p>do not rejoice when he stumbles and falls,</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>because Yahweh will know what you are thinking, and he will not like it,</p><p>and as a result he will not punish that enemy of yours.</p><p>-29-</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Do not become angry/upset about those who do what is evil,</p><p>and do not [SYN] envy them,</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>because nothing good will happen to wicked people;</p><p>they are like a lamp that will soon be extinguished [MET].</p><p>-30-</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>My child/son, revere Yahweh and also honor the king,</p><p>and do not associate with people who want to rebel against either of them,</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>because those people will suddenly experience disasters;</p><p>and no one knows [RHQ] what great disasters that God or the king can cause to happen to them.</p><p>More sayings from wise people</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>Here are more things that wise people have said:</p><p>It is wrong for judges to decide matters unfairly [IDM].</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>If they say to people who are guilty, “You ◄are innocent/have not done something that is wrong►,”</p><p>
    even people in other nations will curse and despise them,</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>but if judges say that guilty people must be punished,</p><p>things will go well for those judges, and ◄they will receive blessings/God will bless them►.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>Those who answer others honestly show that they are truly their friends [IDM].</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>First, do the work that needs to be done outside your house,</p><p>and prepare your fields, and then plant things,</p><p>and after you finish doing that, build your house.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>
    In the courtroom do not testify against someone when you have no reason to do that,</p><p>and do not try to deceive people by what you say [MTY].</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>Do not say, “I will do to him what he did to me;</p><p>I will pay him back for the bad things that he did to me.”</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>One day I walked by the vineyards of a lazy man,</p><p>a man who did not have good sense.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>I was surprised to see that the fields were full of all kinds of thorny bushes,</p><p>and the stone wall around the garden had ◄collapsed/fallen down►.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>When I saw that, I thought about it, and I learned this:</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>
    If you spend a lot of time sleeping and napping and folding your hands while you rest,</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>
    soon you will become poor;</p><p>
    it will be as though [PRS, SIM] a bandit who had a weapon in his hand attacked you and stole all that you had.</p><a href="#PROVERBS-c-25"><h3 id="PROVERBS-c-25">25</h3></a>
<p>More wise sayings from Solomon</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Here are more wise sayings/words that Solomon wrote. Some men who worked for Hezekiah, the king of Judah, copied them from a scroll that Solomon had written.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    We consider God to be great because he ◄acts in mysterious ways/does things that we cannot understand►;</p><p>
    we consider kings to be great because they explain things.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    It is not possible for anyone to measure how high the sky is or how deep the earth/ocean is;</p><p>likewise [SIM], it is not possible for us to know all that kings are thinking.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    If workers burn out the impure bits that are in silver,</p><p>a man who makes things from silver can make something beautiful from the silver.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Similarly, if wicked advisors are taken away from a king,</p><p>his government will remain secure, because the king will be able to act justly.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>When you stand in front of a king, do not try to ◄impress him/honor yourself►</p><p>and do not ◄act like you are important/ask to sit where important people sit;►</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>it is better if someone tells you to sit closer to the king</p><p>than for someone to tell you, while the king is listening, to sit further away in order that someone who is more important may sit closer to the king.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Do not quickly go to a court to tell the judge about something that you have seen,</p><p>because another witness may later say something that proves that you are wrong, and as a result you will be disgraced/ashamed.</p><p>If that happens, ◄what will you do?/you will not know what to do.► [RHQ]</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>If you and someone else think differently about some matter,</p><p>settle it between yourselves, and do not tell others any secret that he has told you.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>If others find out that you have told secrets,</p><p>you will be ashamed,</p><p>and from that time on, ◄you will have a bad reputation/people will think badly about you►.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Something that is said that is very appropriate</p><p>is as delightful as seeing [SIM] gold apples/ornaments in a silver bowl.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>When a wise person rebukes/warns someone [SYN] who is willing to listen,</p><p>that is as valuable as [SIM] a gold ring or a gold chain.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>A messenger who ◄is reliable/tells someone else exactly what he was told to say► refreshes the spirits of his bosses who sent him</p><p>like [SIM] ◄snow/cold water► refreshes the ground at the time that people harvest crops.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>When someone promises to give a gift to us but never gives it,</p><p>
    that disappoints us as much as [SIM] clouds and wind that come but do not bring any rain.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>If someone keeps requesting a ruler long enough to do something, he will often agree to do it;</p><p>similarly, by speaking [MTY] gently we can often convince others that what we say is right [IDM].</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>If you find some honey, do not eat a lot of it,</p><p>because doing that may cause you to vomit.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Do not go to your neighbor’s house very often to talk with him;</p><p>if you go very often, he will get tired of listening to you and start to hate you.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>To falsely accuse others in court</p><p>is like [SIM] attacking them with a war-club or a sword or a sharp arrow.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Depending on unreliable people when you have troubles</p><p>is as bad as trying to eat when you have a bad/hurting tooth or trying to walk when your foot is crippled.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>Singing to someone who is depressed just causes him to feel worse;</p><p>it is like [SIM] taking off clothes on a very cold day</p><p>or like putting vinegar on a wound.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>If your enemies are hungry, give them something to eat;</p><p>if they are thirsty, give them something to drink;</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>doing that will cause them to feel ashamed [IDM],</p><p>and Yahweh will reward you for doing that.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>When wind blows from the right direction, it will rain;</p><p>
    similarly [SIM], if we gossip about others, that causes them to look at us very angrily.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>It is better to live ◄alone/by yourself► in the corner of an attic/housetop</p><p>than to live inside the house with a wife who is always nagging.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>Receiving good news from a country far away refreshes our spirits</p><p>like [SIM] cold water refreshes us when we are very thirsty.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>When a righteous/good person ◄gives in/yields► to wicked people,</p><p>that is as bad as [SIM] a spring that becomes muddied or a fountain that becomes polluted.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>It is not good to eat too much honey,</p><p>and trying to get people to praise you is also not good.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>People who ◄cannot control their tempers/quickly become very angry► are unable to defend their behavior;</p><p>that is like having a city without a wall around it, with the result that no one can defend it.</p><a href="#PROVERBS-c-26"><h3 id="PROVERBS-c-26">26</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>Just like [SIM] it is not appropriate for snow to fall in summer time, or rain to fall at harvest time,</p><p>it is not appropriate to praise/honor foolish people.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Like [SIM] birds that fly by and do not alight/land on anything,</p><p>if someone curses you, it cannot hurt you if you ◄do not deserve them/have not done to him what is wrong►.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>It is necessary to whip a horse and to put a bridle on a donkey to force them to go where we want them to go,</p><p>and similarly [SIM] it is often necessary to strike foolish people with a stick to cause them to do what is right.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>If a foolish person asks a foolish question, do not answer him,</p><p>because if you answer his question, you are just as foolish as he is.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>If you give a foolish answer to someone who asks a foolish question,</p><p>he will realize that he is ◄not very wise/foolish►.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Anyone who asks a foolish person to take a message to someone</p><p>
    is himself doing something as foolish as cutting off his own feet</p><p>or drinking poison.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>A lame man cannot use his legs,</p><p>and similarly [SIM] it is useless for a foolish person to speak [MTY] ◄proverbs/wise sayings►.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Tying a stone in a sling so that it cannot be thrown at a target</p><p>is as foolish as [SIM] honoring a foolish person.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>If a drunk person waves some thorns/brambles with his hand,</p><p>
    he is not able to accomplish anything useful by doing that (OR, he does not feel it when a thorn sticks in his hand);</p><p>similarly, if foolish people speak [MTY] proverbs,</p><p>
    they do not help anyone who hears them.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>A man who shoots arrows to try to wound everybody who is near is foolish;</p><p>similarly, anyone who hires a foolish person who passes by is very foolish.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>A foolish person will foolishly do something stupid a second time;</p><p>it is like [SIM] a dog returning to eat what it has vomited.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    God can help/bless foolish people more easily</p><p>than he can help/bless people who are not wise [RHQ], but think that they are wise.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Lazy people just stay inside their houses and do nothing;</p><p>
    they keep saying “I think there is a lion in the street!”</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>A door continually swings back and forth on its hinges and does not go anywhere;</p><p>similarly [SIM], lazy people just continually turn over in their beds and never do anything.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>Some people are extremely lazy;</p><p>they put their hand in a dish to get some food but do not even lift the food up to their mouths.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>Lazy people think that they are wiser than seven/several people</p><p>who can answer others’ questions with good sense.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Anyone who ◄meddles/involves himself► in a quarrel that does not concern him</p><p>is as foolish as [SIM] someone who tries to grab a passing dog by its ears.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>Crazy people who shoot burning arrows to kill people</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>are as foolish as those who deceive someone else</p><p>and then say, “I was only joking.”</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>If there is no more firewood to put on the fire, the fire will go out;</p><p>similarly [SIM], if there are no people who ◄gossip/tell people things that are not true►, quarreling will end.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    Putting charcoal on burning coals or putting wood on a fire causes the fire to keep burning;</p><p>similarly, people who like to quarrel cause people to keep arguing.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>People enjoy listening to what gossips say about others just like [SIM] they enjoy tasty food;</p><p>they enjoy listening to what gossips tell them like they enjoy swallowing tasty food.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>People who say nice things when they are thinking about doing evil things</p><p>are like a nice glaze/covering on a cheap clay pot.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>Those who hate someone and are saying [MTY] something very different from what they are thinking are hypocrites;</p><p>they are only planning to harm that person.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>When they say nice things, do not believe them,</p><p>because in their inner beings are many things that Yahweh hates.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>They try to deceive people to cause them to think that they do not hate that person,</p><p>but in a public meeting, the people will find out the evil things that they have done.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>Those who dig a deep pit for other people to fall into will fall into it themselves;</p><p>rocks will roll down on those who start to cause rocks to roll down to crush someone.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>Those [MTY] who tell lies to others really hate them,</p><p>and those who deceive others ruin them.</p><a href="#PROVERBS-c-27"><h3 id="PROVERBS-c-27">27</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>Do not boast about what you will do tomorrow,</p><p>because you do not know what will happen [PRS] on any day.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Do not praise yourself [MTY, PRS]; allow others to praise you.</p><p>If someone else praises you, that is okay.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    It causes pain to our bodies to carry heavy stones or a pail full of sand,</p><p>but doing something stupid/foolish can cause great pain to other people’s spirits.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>It is cruel to be angry with others, and our being angry sometimes destroys others,</p><p>but being jealous of someone is [RHQ] often more cruel than that.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>It is better to correct someone openly</p><p>than to show that you l don’t love that person by not correcting him.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>If a friend criticizes you, he is a good friend and you can trust him;</p><p>but if one of your enemies kisses you, he is probably wanting to deceive you.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>When someone’s stomach is full, he does not want to eat honey;</p><p>but when someone is very hungry, he thinks that even bitter things taste sweet.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Anyone who wanders far from his home/family</p><p>is like [SIM] a bird that is far from its nest.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    Putting olive oil and perfume on a person’s skin causes him to feel good,</p><p>but having a friend who gives good advice is even better.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Do not neglect your friends or your parents’ friends;</p><p>and at a time when you are experiencing a disaster, do not go to a relative who lives far away to request his help;</p><p>someone who lives near you can help you more than relatives who live far away.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>My child/son, cause me to be happy by becoming wise,</p><p>in order that I will know how to reply to those who would criticize me about your behavior.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Those who have good sense will realize that there is something dangerous ahead, and they will hide;</p><p>those who do not have good sense just keep going, and later they will suffer because of doing that.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    You deserve to have your property taken from you</p><p>if you foolishly promise to a stranger (OR, a strange woman) that you will pay what she owes if she is unable to pay it [DOU].</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>If you rise early in the morning and call out a greeting to your neighbor while he is still sleeping,</p><p>he will consider it to be a curse, not a blessing.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    Having a wife that is constantly nagging</p><p>is as bad as listening to rain continually dripping on a rainy day.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    Trying to restrain/stop her from doing that is as difficult [SIM] as trying to stop the wind</p><p>or trying to hold oil in your hand.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    We can use one iron tool to sharpen another iron tool;</p><p>similarly [SIM], when one person shares what he is thinking, it can help other people to think more clearly.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>Those who take care of fig trees will have figs to eat;</p><p>
    similarly, servants who protect their master will be honored by him.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    When a person looks in the water, he sees his own face;</p><p>similarly [SIM], when we look at a person’s behavior, we know what he is thinking.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    It is as though the place where the dead people are is always wanting more people to die and come there;</p><p>and humans [SYN] are always wanting to acquire more things, too.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    Workers put silver and gold in a very hot furnace to burn out what is impure,</p><p>and [SIM] people learn what we are really like when they see how we react when people praise us.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>Even if you beat/crush a fool severely like [MET] you pulverize grain with a pestle,</p><p>you probably will not be able to cause him to stop ◄being foolish/doing foolish things►.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>Take good care of your flocks of sheep</p><p>and herds of cattle,</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>because the money that you acquired from selling animals previously will not ◄last/stay with you► forever;</p><p>similarly [SIM], governments [MTY] certainly do not [RHQ] last forever.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>After you cut the hay [DOU] and store it to feed the animals in the winter while a new crop of hay is growing,</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>you will be able to shear the sheep and make clothes from the wool,</p><p>and you will get money from selling some of the goats to buy more land,</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>and you will get enough milk from the other goats</p><p>for you and your family and your female servants.</p><a href="#PROVERBS-c-28"><h3 id="PROVERBS-c-28">28</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>Wicked people run away even when no one is pursuing them,</p><p>but righteous/good people are not afraid; they are as brave as lions.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>When the people of a nation sin, they will have one ruler after another;</p><p>but when their leaders are wise and have good sense, their government will last for a long time.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>A poor person who oppresses other poor people</p><p>is like [MET] a very heavy/hard rain that destroys the crops, with the result that there is no food for people to eat.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Those who reject/disobey God’s laws always speak well of wicked people;</p><p>but those who obey God’s laws always oppose what wicked people do.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Evil people do not understand what it means to act justly,</p><p>but those who try to obey/worship Yahweh understand that very well.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>It is better to be honest even though you are poor</p><p>than to be dishonest even though you are rich.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Young people who obey the laws are wise [IDM];</p><p>parents whose children associate with those who ◄carouse/go to wild parties► are humiliated/disgraced because of what their children do.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>When people become very rich by charging very high interest [DOU],</p><p>their money will eventually go to someone who does kind things for the poor.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>If people do not obey [MTY] God’s laws,</p><p>
    God ◄detests their prayers/considers that their prayers stink►.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Those who cause honest/good people to do what is evil</p><p>will fall into their own pits/traps,</p><p>but good things will happen to those who ◄are innocent/have not done what is wrong►.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    Many rich people think that they are wise,</p><p>but poor people who have good sense will find out whether rich people really are wise or not.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>When righteous/good people ◄succeed/win elections►, everyone ◄celebrates/is happy►;</p><p>but when wicked people win, everyone hides because they are afraid of what the wicked people will do.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Those who refuse to confess/admit their sins will not prosper,</p><p>but God acts mercifully/kindly toward those who confess their sins and turn away from their sinful behavior.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    God is pleased with those who always revere him,</p><p>but those who are stubborn [IDM] will experience disasters.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>Wicked people who mistreat poor people whom they rule</p><p>are as dangerous to them as [SIM] a lion roaring at them or a bear springing up to attack them.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>Rulers who do not have good sense cruelly oppress the people they rule,</p><p>but rulers who do not want to become rich by cheating/deceiving people will live (OR, rule) for a long time.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Those who are guilty of murdering [MTY] another person</p><p>will ◄be fugitives/keep running away► until they die;</p><p>do not help them to escape.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>Those who continually do what is right will be safe/protected,</p><p>but those who are dishonest will suddenly be ruined.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Farmers who work hard in their fields will produce good crops and always have plenty of food to eat,</p><p>but those who spend all their time ◄on useless projects/doing things that do not benefit anyone► will become very poor.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    God will greatly bless those who ◄are trustworthy/always do what they say that they will do►,</p><p>but he will certainly punish [LIT] those who try to become rich quickly.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>It is not good for judges to decide matters unfairly/unjustly,</p><p>but some people will do what is wrong even if they receive only a very small bribe [HYP] for doing it.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>Selfish people [IDM] are very eager to become rich quickly;</p><p>they do not realize that they will soon become poor.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>Those who rebuke someone will be appreciated/thanked more</p><p>than those who say nice things to others merely to ◄flatter them/cause them to feel good►.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>Anyone who steals things from his father or his mother</p><p>and says “That is not sinful”</p><p>is as bad as a bandit.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>Greedy people cause trouble/strife;</p><p>those who trust in Yahweh will prosper [IDM].</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>Those who believe that what they think is always right are foolish;</p><p>those who act wisely will ◄escape danger/be safe►.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>Those who give things to poor people will not become poor,</p><p>but many people will curse those who refuse to help [IDM] poor people.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>When wicked people become rulers, people hide because they are afraid of what those wicked people will do;</p><p>but when wicked people are no longer rulers, good/righteous people will become the rulers.</p><a href="#PROVERBS-c-29"><h3 id="PROVERBS-c-29">29</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>Some people remain stubborn [IDM] even though they are often reproved/warned about doing what is wrong,</p><p>
    but some day they will be crushed/ruined, and nothing will be able to heal them.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>When righteous people are rulers, people are happy,</p><p>but when wicked people rule, people ◄groan/are miserable►.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Those who are eager to become wise cause their parents to be glad;</p><p>those who spend their time with prostitutes will end up giving all their money to them.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>When a king rules justly/fairly, he causes his nation to be strong,</p><p>but a king who is concerned only with getting more money from the people ruins his nation.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Those who ◄flatter others/say nice things to others merely to cause them to feel good► are really setting a trap for them (OR, for themselves) [SYN].</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Evil people will be trapped by the sins that they commit,</p><p>but righteous/honest people will sing and be joyful/happy.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Righteous/Good people know that poor people should be treated fairly/justly,</p><p>
    but wicked people ◄are not concerned about/do not pay attention to► those matters at all.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Those who make fun of everything that is good say things that cause everyone in the city to ◄be agitated/in turmoil►;</p><p>those who are wise enable people to remain calm.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>If a wise person sues a foolish person,</p><p>the foolish person merely laughs at him and yells at him and will not be quiet (OR, the dispute will not be resolved).</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Those who murder others hate people who ◄are honest/always do what is right►,</p><p>but righteous people try to protect them.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>People who are wise are patient and restrain/control themselves when they are angry,</p><p>but foolish people ◄quickly show others that they are very angry/do not restrain themselves at all►.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>If a ruler ◄pays attention to/believes► people who tell lies,</p><p>all his officials will also become wicked.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>There is one thing that is true about both poor people and those who oppress them:</p><p>Yahweh enables all of them to see.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>If kings judge poor people fairly,</p><p>they will continue to rule for a long time.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>If children are punished/spanked and reproved/warned,</p><p>they become wise;</p><p>but if they are allowed to do whatever they want to do,</p><p>they do things that cause their mothers to be ashamed of them.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>When wicked people rule, there are more crimes committed {people commit more crimes},</p><p>but some day those wicked people will ◄be defeated/no longer rule►, and righteous people will see that happen.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>If you discipline your children, they will no longer do things that will cause you to be worried;</p><p>instead, they will do things that will delight you [SYN].</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>When the people of a nation do not receive messages that come directly from God, they do not control their behavior.</p><p>
    God is pleased with those who obey his laws.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>It is not possible to correct/discipline servants only by talking to them;</p><p>they understand what you are saying, but they do not pay attention to it.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    God can help/bless foolish people more easily [RHQ]</p><p>than he can help/bless people who speak without thinking first.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>If someone gives his servants everything that they want, starting from when they are young,</p><p>some day those servants will take from him everything that he owns.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>Those who quickly become angry cause many arguments,</p><p>and they also commit many sins.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>Proud people will be disgraced;</p><p>those who are humble will be respected.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>Those who help thieves to steal only hurt themselves;</p><p>
    when they are in court, they solemnly ask God to curse them if they do not tell the truth,</p><p>but they do not tell the truth about the crime that was committed,</p><p>
    and as a result, God will curse them.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>It is like a dangerous trap [MET] for people to be ◄afraid of/worried about► what others will think about them,</p><p>but those who trust in Yahweh are safe/protected.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>Many people request rulers to do things to help them,</p><p>but Yahweh is the only one who surely does for people what is fair/just.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>Righteous people hate/detest those who do what is evil,</p><p>and wicked people hate those whose behavior is always good.</p><a href="#PROVERBS-c-30"><h3 id="PROVERBS-c-30">30</h3></a>
<p>Wise sayings from Agur</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>These are sayings/messages that God gave to Agur, the son of Jakeh.</p><p>
    Agur wrote them for Ithiel and Ucal.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>It seems that I am very stupid;</p><p>I do not deserve to be considered to be a human;</p><p>I do not have the good sense that humans should have.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>I have not learned how to become wise</p><p>and I do not know much about God.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    But let me say this:</p><p>No one [RHQ] has ascended to heaven to find out what God is like and returned to tell us.</p><p>No one [RHQ] has gathered/held the wind in his hand.</p><p>No one [RHQ] has wrapped the water in the ocean in a piece of cloth,</p><p>and no one [RHQ] has established the boundaries of the earth.</p><p>
    If you know who has done those things, tell me [RHQ] his name, and the names of his children [SAR]!</p><p>
    But you do not know who has done those things, so you cannot speak with authority about what God is like.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Everything that God has said is true;</p><p>he is like a shield [MET] for all those who request him to protect them.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Do not add to (OR, change) what God has said;</p><p>if you do that, he will rebuke you and show that you are lying.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    God, I ask you to do two things for me;</p><p>
    please do them before I die:</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Help me never to lie or deceive people</p><p>and do not cause me to become poor or to become rich.</p><p>
    Just give me the food that I need;</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>because if I become rich,</p><p>I might say that I do not [RHQ] know you and that I do not need you;</p><p>and if I become poor,</p><p>I might dishonor you by stealing things.</p><p>More wise sayings</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Do not ◄slander/say bad things about► a worker to his boss;</p><p>if you do that, the worker will curse you, and cause you to have trouble.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    I will list four kinds of evil things that people do:</p><p>Some people curse their fathers and do not ask God to bless their mothers.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Some people think that they are perfect,</p><p>but really they have never been cleansed from their guilt for committing disgusting sins.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Some people are very proud;</p><p>they think that they are very good and they despise others.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>Some people act very cruelly toward others;</p><p>
    it is as though [MET] they have teeth that are like sharp knives;</p><p>they severely oppress poor people</p><p>and try to cause them to disappear from the land.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>Leeches are always wanting more blood to suck;</p><p>
    similarly, greedy people are always saying “Give me some!” or “Give me more!” [MET]</p><p>There are four things that are never ◄satisfied/content with what they have►;</p><p>they always want more [LIT]:</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>The place where the dead people are;</p><p>women who do not have any children;</p><p>ground that needs water/rain;</p><p>and a fire that always needs more wood.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Those who [SYN] make fun of their fathers</p><p>or refuse to obey their mothers (OR, despise their aged mothers)</p><p>should die and have their eyes pecked out by crows,</p><p>and the rest of their corpses should be fed to the vultures.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>There are four things that are wonderful to me,</p><p>
    but I do not understand any of them:</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>How eagles fly in the sky,</p><p>how snakes are able to move/crawl across a big rock,</p><p>how ships sail on the seas,</p><p>and how a man falls in love with a woman.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>This is what a woman who ◄is not faithful to/does not have sex only with► her husband does:</p><p>She commits adultery [EUP], and then bathes</p><p>and says, “I have not done anything that is wrong!”</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>There are four things that no one in the world can tolerate:</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    What a slave does who becomes a king,</p><p>a foolish person eating too much food,</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    what a woman who is hated does when she gets married,</p><p>and what a female servant does when she becomes the boss instead of her mistress.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    There are four animals on the earth that are small, but they are very wise:</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>Ants are not strong,</p><p>but they store up food during the summer in order to have it during the winter.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>Rock badgers also are not strong,</p><p>but they make their homes among the rocks where they will be safe.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>Locusts do not have a king,</p><p>but they march like the soldiers in an army.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>Lizards/Geckos are very small and you can hold them in your hand,</p><p>but they are cleverly able to get inside kings’ palaces.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>
    There are four animals that strut around and look very impressive while they walk [DOU]:</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>Lions, which are stronger than all other animals</p><p>and are not afraid of any of them;</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>male goats, strutting roosters,</p><p>and kings who ◄parade/walk proudly back and forth► in front of the people whom they rule.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>If you have acted foolishly, exalting yourself,</p><p>or if you been planning to do something evil,</p><p>stop it immediately [IDM]!</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>If you churn milk, it produces butter/curds,</p><p>and if you hit someone hard on his nose, his nose bleeds;</p><p>similarly, if you do something to cause people to become angry, strife usually results.</p><a href="#PROVERBS-c-31"><h3 id="PROVERBS-c-31">31</h3></a>
<p>Wise sayings from King Lemuel</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>These are sayings/messages that God gave to King Lemuel’s mother, and which his mother taught him:</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>You are my son; I gave birth to you [RHQ];</p><p>you are the son that God gave me in answer to my prayers.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Do not exhaust your energy having sex [EUP] with women to whom you are not married,</p><p>with women who ruin kings by having sex with them.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Lemuel, kings should not be constantly drinking wine</p><p>or greatly desire to drink other strong/alcoholic drinks.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>If they do that, they forget the laws that they have made,</p><p>and they do not do what is right for poor/afflicted people.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Give strong/alcoholic drinks to those who are dying</p><p>and to those who are ◄greatly distressed/suffering very much►.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>If they drink, they will forget that they are poor,</p><p>and they will not think about their distress/troubles any more.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Speak [MTY] to defend people who are unable to defend themselves;</p><p>speak to encourage others to do what is right for those who are helpless.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Speak [MTY] ◄on their behalf/to help them► and try to cause judges to decide matters fairly/justly;</p><p>try to cause others to do for poor and needy people what should be done for them.</p><p>Praise for a good wife</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>It is very difficult for a man to [RHQ] find a wife who is good and who is capable of doing many things.</p><p>
    Any woman who is like that is worth more than jewels.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Her husband completely trusts her,</p><p>and because of her, he has everything that he needs [LIT].</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>She never does anything that would harm him;</p><p>she does good things for him all the days of her life.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>She finds wool and flax in the market,</p><p>and she enjoys spinning it to make yarn.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>She is like [SIM] a ship that brings from far away goods/merchandise to sell,</p><p>
    because she buys food that comes from far away.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>She gets up before dawn to prepare food for her family.</p><p>
    Then she plans the work that her servant girls will do on that day.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>She goes out and looks at a field that someone wants to sell;</p><p>and if it is a good field, she buys it.</p><p>She buys grapevines [MTY] with the money that she has earned,</p><p>
    and then she plants them.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>She works very hard [IDM];</p><p>she makes her arms strong by the work she does.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>She knows when she is getting a good profit from her business.</p><p>
    When it is necessary, she works [MTY] until it is late at night.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>She holds the ◄spindle/rod which twists the thread that she is making►,</p><p>and then she spins the thread [MTY] that she will use.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>She generously helps [MTY] those who are poor and needy [DOU].</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>She is not worried that the people in her house will be cold in the winter,</p><p>because she has made warm clothes for all of them.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>She makes bedspreads/quilts for the beds.</p><p>She wears fine linen clothes that are dyed purple, like queens wear.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>Her husband is well known by the important people of the town;</p><p>he sits with the other town leaders in the meetings of the town council.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>She makes clothes from linen cloth and sells them.</p><p>She sells sashes to shop owners.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>She is strong in her character and respected/dignified,</p><p>and she ◄laughs at/is not afraid of► what will happen in the future.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>When she speaks, she says what is wise.</p><p>When she gives instructions,</p><p>she speaks [MTY] kindly (OR, faithfully).</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>She watches over everything that is done in her household,</p><p>and she [IDM] is never lazy.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>Her children all together speak highly of her,</p><p>and her husband also praises her.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>
    He says to her, “There are many women who do admirable things,</p><p>but you surpass them all!”</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>Some women who are attractive are not really good women,</p><p>
    but they can deceive us regarding what they are really like.</p><p>Furthermore, women’s beauty does not last;</p><p>but women who revere Yahweh should be honored.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>Reward women who are like that,</p><p>and praise them in public [MTY] for what they have done.</p><a href="#PROVERBS-h">^</a> <a href="#PROVERBS-c-1">[1]</a> <a href="#PROVERBS-c-2">[2]</a> <a href="#PROVERBS-c-3">[3]</a> <a href="#PROVERBS-c-4">[4]</a> <a href="#PROVERBS-c-5">[5]</a> <a href="#PROVERBS-c-6">[6]</a> <a href="#PROVERBS-c-7">[7]</a> <a href="#PROVERBS-c-8">[8]</a> <a href="#PROVERBS-c-9">[9]</a> <a href="#PROVERBS-c-10">[10]</a> <a href="#PROVERBS-c-11">[11]</a> <a href="#PROVERBS-c-12">[12]</a> <a href="#PROVERBS-c-13">[13]</a> <a href="#PROVERBS-c-14">[14]</a> <a href="#PROVERBS-c-15">[15]</a> <a href="#PROVERBS-c-16">[16]</a> <a href="#PROVERBS-c-17">[17]</a> <a href="#PROVERBS-c-18">[18]</a> <a href="#PROVERBS-c-19">[19]</a> <a href="#PROVERBS-c-20">[20]</a> <a href="#PROVERBS-c-21">[21]</a> <a href="#PROVERBS-c-22">[22]</a> <a href="#PROVERBS-c-23">[23]</a> <a href="#PROVERBS-c-24">[24]</a> <a href="#PROVERBS-c-25">[25]</a> <a href="#PROVERBS-c-26">[26]</a> <a href="#PROVERBS-c-27">[27]</a> <a href="#PROVERBS-c-28">[28]</a> <a href="#PROVERBS-c-29">[29]</a> <a href="#PROVERBS-c-30">[30]</a> <a href="#PROVERBS-c-31">[31]</a>
