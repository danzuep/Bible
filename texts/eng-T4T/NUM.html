<p>The men of Israel were counted</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>In April of the year after the Israeli people left Egypt, Yahweh spoke to Moses/me while he/I was in the Sacred Tent, in the Sinai Desert. Yahweh said to him/me, <sup>2-3</sup>“I want you and Aaron to determine how many Israeli men are able to fight in battles. Write down the names of all the men who are at least 20 years old, and write down the names of their clans and families. <sup>4</sup>I have chosen one man from each of the tribes to help you to do this. Each one will be a leader of his clan.</p><p>
    <sup>5-15</sup>Their names are:</p><p>Elizur, the son of Shedeur, from the tribe of Reuben;</p><p>Shelumiel, the son of Zurishaddai, from the tribe of Simeon;</p><p>Nahshon, the son of Amminadab, from the tribe of Judah;</p><p>Nethanel, the son of Zuar, from the tribe of Issachar;</p><p>Eliab, the son of Helon, from the tribe of Zebulun;</p><p>Elishama, the son of Ammihud, from the tribe of Joseph’s son Ephraim;</p><p>Gamaliel, the son of Pedahzur, from the tribe of Joseph’s son Manasseh;</p><p>Abidan, the son of Gideoni, from the tribe of Benjamin;</p><p>Ahiezer, the son of Ammishaddai, from the tribe of Dan;</p><p>Pagiel, the son of Ocran, from the tribe of Asher;</p><p>Eliasaph, the son of Deuel, from the tribe of Gad;</p><p>Ahira, the son of Enan, from the tribe of Naphtali.”</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>Those were the men whom Yahweh chose from the people. They were leaders of their tribes. They were the chief men of the clans of the Israeli people.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Aaron and Moses/I summoned all these leaders, <sup>18</sup>and they gathered all of the people together on that same day. They listed/wrote down the names of all the men who were at least 20 years old, and with their names they wrote the names of their clans and their family groups <sup>19</sup>just as Moses/I had commanded. They wrote the names while ◄the Israelis/we► were there in the Sinai Desert.</p><p>
    <sup>20-43</sup>This is a list of the number of men who were at least 20 years old and able to fight in battles, and the names of their tribes:</p><p>There were 46,500 men from the tribe of Reuben (who was Jacob’s oldest son);</p><p>there were 59,300 men from the tribe of Simeon;</p><p>there were 45,560 men from the tribe of Gad;</p><p>there were 74,600 men from the tribe of Judah;</p><p>there were 54,400 men from the tribe of Issachar;</p><p>there were 57,400 men from the tribe of Zebulun;</p><p>there were 40,500 men from the tribe of Ephraim;</p><p>there were 32,200 men from the tribe of Manasseh;</p><p>there were 35,400 men from the tribe of Benjamin;</p><p>there were 62,700 men from the tribe of Dan;</p><p>there were 41,500 men from the tribe of Asher;</p><p>there were 53,400 men from the tribe of Naphtali.</p><p>
    <sup>44-45</sup>That was the number of men from each tribe that Aaron and Moses/I and the twelve leaders of the tribes of Israel listed, along with the names of their clans. <sup>46</sup>The total was 603,550 men.</p><p>
    <sup>47</sup>But this number did not include the names of the men of the tribe of Levi, <sup>48</sup>because Yahweh had said to Moses/me, <sup>49</sup>“When you ◄count/write the names of► the men of the tribes of Israel, do not count the men in the tribe of Levi. <sup>50</sup>Appoint the male descendants of Levi to take care of the Sacred Tent and the chest inside it that contains the tablets on which are written the Ten Commandments. They must also take care of the other things that are inside the tent. When you travel, they are the ones who must carry the tent and all the things that are inside it, and they must take care of it and set up their tents around it. <sup>51</sup>Whenever it is time for all of you to move to another location, the descendants of Levi are the ones who must dismantle the tent. And when it is time to stop traveling, they are the ones who must set up the Sacred Tent again. Any other person who goes near the Sacred Tent to do this work must be executed. <sup>52</sup>The people of each Israeli tribe must set up their tents in their own area, and they must set up a flag/banner that represents their tribe. <sup>53</sup>But the male descendants of Levi must set up their tents around the Sacred Tent, in order to protect the other Israeli people from being punished [MTY] by Yahweh for coming close to the Sacred Tent. The descendants of Levi are the ones who must stand around the Sacred Tent to guard it.”</p><p>
    <sup>54</sup>So the Israeli people did everything just like Yahweh had commanded Moses/me.</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-2"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-2">2</h3></a>
<p>Instructions for setting up the Israeli camp</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Then Yahweh said this to Aaron and Moses/me: <sup>2</sup>“When the Israelis set up their tents, they should set them up in areas that surround the Sacred Tent, but not close to it. The people of each tribe must set up their tents in a different area. Each tribe must erect in that area a banner of their own clan and a flag that represents their tribe.</p><p>
    <sup>3-4</sup>The people of the tribes of Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun must set up their tents on the east side of the Sacred Tent, close to their tribal flags. These are the names of the leaders of those tribes and the number of soldiers whom they will lead:</p><p>Nahshon, the son of Amminadab, will be the leader of the 74,600 men of the tribe of Judah.</p><p>
    <sup>5-6</sup>Nethanel, the son of Zuar, will be the leader of the 54,500 men of the tribe of Issachar.</p><p>
    <sup>7-8</sup>Eliab, the son of Helon, will be the leader of the 57,400 men of the tribe of Zebulun.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>So there will be 86,400 troops on the east side of the Sacred Tent. Whenever the Israelis move to a new location, those three tribes must go in front of the others.</p><p>
    <sup>10-11</sup>The tribes of Reuben, Simeon, and Gad must set up their tents on the south side of the Sacred Tent, close to their tribal flags. These are the names of the leaders of those tribes and the number of men whom they will lead:</p><p>Elizur, the son of Shedeur, will be the leader of the 46,500 men of the tribe of Reuben.</p><p>
    <sup>12-13</sup>Shelumiel, the son of Zurishaddai, will be the leader of the 59,300 men of the tribe of Simeon.</p><p>
    <sup>14-15</sup>Eliasaph, the son of Deuel, will be the leader of the 45,650 men of the tribe of Gad.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>So there will be 151,450 troops on the south side of the Sacred Tent. Those three tribes will follow the first group when the Israelis travel.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Behind that group will walk the descendants of Levi, who will carry the Sacred Tent. The Israelis will march in the same order that they always set up their tents. Each tribe will carry its own flag.</p><p>
    <sup>18-19</sup>The tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin must set up their tents on the west side of the Sacred Tent, close to their tribal flags. These are the names of the leaders of those tribes and number of men whom they will lead:</p><p>Elishama, the son of Ammihud, will be the leader of the 40,500 men of the tribe of Ephraim.</p><p>
    <sup>20-21</sup>Gamaliel, the son of Pedahzur, will be the leader of the 32,200 men of the tribe of Manasseh.</p><p>
    <sup>22-23</sup>Abidan, the son of Gideoni, will be the leader of the 35,400 men of the tribe of Benjamin.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>So there will be 108,100 troops on the west side of the Sacred Tent. Those three tribes will follow the second group, behind the descendants of Levi.</p><p>
    <sup>25-26</sup>The tribes of Dan, Asher, and Naphtali must set up their tents on the north side of the Sacred Tent, close to their tribal flags. These are the names of the leaders of those tribes and the number of men whom they will lead:</p><p>Ahiezer, the son of Ammishaddai, will be the leader of the 62,700 men of the tribe of Dan.</p><p>
    <sup>27-28</sup>Pagiel, the son of Ocran, will be the leader of the 41,500 men of the tribe of Asher.</p><p>
    <sup>29-30</sup>Ahira, the son of Enan, will be the leader of the 53,400 men of the tribe of Naphtali.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>So there will be 157,600 troops on the north side of the Sacred Tent. Those three tribes will be last. They must carry their own flags when the Israelis travel.”</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>So there were 603,550 Israeli men who were able to fight who were listed according to their families’ ancestors. <sup>33</sup>But just as Yahweh had commanded, the names of the descendants of Levi were not included.</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>The Israelis did everything that Yahweh had told Moses/me. They set up their tents close to their tribal flags, and when they traveled to a new location, they walked with their own clans and family groups.</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-3"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-3">3</h3></a>
<p>The sons of Aaron</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>These are some of the things that happened to Aaron and Moses/me when Yahweh spoke to Moses/me on Sinai Mountain.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Aaron’s four sons were Nadab the oldest, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. <sup>3</sup>They were appointed [MTY] (OR, Moses/I appointed them) to be priests. <sup>4</sup>But, while Yahweh was watching, Nadab and Abihu died in the Sinai Desert because they burned incense in a manner that was different from what Yahweh had commanded. They had no sons, so Eleazar and Ithamar were the only sons of Aaron who were left to be priests, along with their father Aaron.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, <sup>6</sup>“Bring the men of the tribe of Levi and present them to Aaron, in order that they may assist him. <sup>7</sup>They will serve Aaron and all the other Israeli people, while they do their work inside the Sacred Tent and outside it. <sup>8</sup>They must serve all the Israeli people by taking care of all the things that are inside the Sacred Tent. <sup>9</sup>Appoint them to help Aaron and his two sons. I have chosen them from all the Israeli people to do that. <sup>10</sup>Appoint Aaron and his two sons to do the work that priests do. But anyone else who comes close to the Sacred Tent to do that work must be executed.”</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Yahweh also told Moses/me, <sup>12</sup>“Note that from all the Israelis, I have chosen the men of the tribe of Levi to take the places of all the firstborn sons of the Israeli people. The male descendants of Levi belong to me, <sup>13</sup>because truly all the firstborn males belong to me. That is because on the day that I killed all the firstborn sons of the people of Egypt, I spared all the firstborn sons of the Israelis and set them apart for myself. I also set apart the firstborn males of your domestic animals. They belong to me, Yahweh.”</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>Yahweh spoke to Moses/me again in the Sinai Desert. He said, <sup>15</sup>“Count the male members of the tribe of Levi. Write down their names and the names of their clans and family groups. Count all the males who are at least one month old.” <sup>16</sup>So Moses/I counted them, just as Yahweh commanded.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Levi had three sons, whose names were Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>Gershon had two sons: Libni and Shimei. The clans that were descended from them had the same names as those two sons.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Kohath had four sons: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. The clans that were descended from them had the same names as those four sons.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>Merari had two sons: Mahli and Mushi. The clans that were descended from them had the same names as those two sons.</p><p>Those are the clans that were descended from Levi.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>The two clans descended from Gershon are those that were descended from his sons Libni and Shimei. <sup>22</sup>In those two clans there were 7,500 males who were at least one month old. <sup>23</sup>They were told to set up their tents on the west side of the Sacred Tent. <sup>24</sup>The leader of those two clans was Eliasaph, the son of Lael. <sup>25</sup>Their work was to take care of the Sacred Tent, including the coverings of the tent, the curtain at the entrance of the tent, <sup>26</sup>the ◄curtains/large pieces of cloth► that formed the walls around the courtyard that is around the tent and around the altar, the curtains that were at the entrance of the courtyard, and the ropes for fastening the tent. They also did all the work of taking care of the things outside the Sacred Tent.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>The clans that were descended from Kohath were those descended from his four sons: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. <sup>28</sup>In those four clans there were 8,600 males who were at least one month old. The work of the men of the clans was to take care of the things that are inside the Sacred Tent. <sup>29</sup>They set up their tents on the south side of the Sacred Tent. <sup>30</sup>The leader of those four clans was Elizaphan, the son of Uzziel. <sup>31</sup>The work of the men of those clans was to take care of the sacred chest, the table on which the priest put the sacred bread, the lampstand, the altars, all the items that the priest used in the Sacred Tent, and the curtain that is inside the tent. Their work was also to take care of the things inside the tent.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>Aaron’s son Eleazar was the leader of all the male descendants of Levi. He supervised all the work that was done at the Sacred Tent.</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>The clans that were descended from Merari were those descended from his sons Mahli and Mushi. <sup>34</sup>In those two clans there were 6,200 males who were at least one month old. <sup>35</sup>They were told to set up their tents on the north side of the Sacred Tent. The leader of those two clans was Zuriel, the son of Abihail. <sup>36</sup>The work of the men of those two clans was to take care of the frames that held up the tent, the crossbars, the pillars, and the bases. They also did all the work that was connected with those items. <sup>37</sup>Their work was also to take care of the posts that held up the curtains that formed the walls of the courtyard, and all the bases, tent pegs, and ropes that fastened those curtains.</p><p>
    <sup>38</sup>Aaron and Moses/I and Aaron’s sons were told to set up their/our tents in the area in front of the Sacred Tent, on the east side. Their/Our work was to supervise the work that would be done in and around the Sacred Tent, for the benefit of the Israeli people. Only the priests were permitted to do that. Yahweh declared that we should execute anyone else who went near the tent to do the work that the priests do.</p><p>
    <sup>39</sup>When Aaron and Moses/I counted all the males who were at least one month old, who belonged to the clans descended from Levi, the total was 22,000.</p><p>
    <sup>40</sup>Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Now count all the other firstborn males in Israel who are at least one month old, and write down their names. <sup>41</sup>Also, set apart for me the descendants of Levi to be substitutes for the firstborn males of the other Israelis. And set apart for me the livestock of the descendants of Levi to be substitutes for the firstborn livestock of the other Israeli people.”</p><p>
    <sup>42</sup>So Moses/I did that. He/I counted the firstborn males of all the Israeli people, as Yahweh had commanded. <sup>43</sup>The total of those who were at least one month old was 22,273.</p><p>
    <sup>44</sup>Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, <sup>45</sup>“Set apart the descendants of Levi to be substitutes for the firstborn males of the other Israeli people. The descendants of Levi belong to me, Yahweh. <sup>46</sup>There are 273 more firstborn males of the other Israeli people than of the descendants of Levi. <sup>47-48</sup>To pay for these 273 males, collect five pieces of silver for each of them. Each of those pieces of silver must weigh the same as each of the silver coins that are stored in the Sacred Tent. Give this silver to Aaron and his sons.”</p><p>
    <sup>49</sup>So Moses/I did that. He/I collected the silver from those 273 males. <sup>50</sup>The total was 1,365 pieces of silver. Each silver coin weighed the same as each of the silver coins stored in the Sacred Tent. <sup>51</sup>Moses/I gave these silver coins to Aaron and his sons, as Yahweh had commanded.</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-4"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-4">4</h3></a>
<p>The work of the clans descended from Kohath</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, <sup>2</sup>“Write down the names of the men who belong to the clans descended from Levi. <sup>3</sup>Write the names of the men who are between 30 and 50 years old. These will be men who will work at the Sacred Tent.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>“The work of these descendants of Kohath will be to take care of the sacred items that are used when the people worship at the Sacred Tent. <sup>5</sup>When you Israelis move to another location, Aaron and his sons must enter the tent to take down the curtain that separates the Very Holy Place from the other part of the Sacred Tent. They must cover the sacred chest with that curtain. <sup>6</sup>Then they must cover that with a nice covering made from the skins of goats. Over that they must spread a blue cloth. Then they must insert into the rings on the chest the poles for carrying it.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>“Then they must put a blue cloth over the table on which the priests put the sacred bread. On top of the cloth they must put the bowls for incense, the pans, the other dishes, the jars for the wine that will be offered as a sacrifice, and the sacred bread. <sup>8</sup>Over all of this they must spread a scarlet/red cloth. Finally, they must put on top a nice covering made from the skins of goats. Then they must insert into the rings at the corners of the tables the poles for carrying it.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>“Then with another blue cloth they must cover the lampstand, the lamps, the lamp snuffers, the trays, and the special jars of olive oil to burn in the lamps. <sup>10</sup>They must cover the lampstand and all the other items with a nice covering made from the skins of goats. They must place all these things on a frame for carrying them.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>“Then they must spread another blue cloth over the gold altar which is used for burning incense. Over this they must spread a nice covering made from the skins of goats. Then they must insert into the rings of that altar the poles for carrying it.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>“They must take all the other items that are inside the Sacred Tent and wrap them in a blue cloth, cover that with a nice covering made from the skins of goats, and place all that on a frame for carrying it.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>“Then they must remove the ashes from the altar on which they have burned sacrifices. Then they must cover the altar with a purple cloth. <sup>14</sup>Then they must spread on top of the cloth all the items used at the altar—the pans for carrying the hot coals, the meat forks, the shovels, the bowls for containing the blood to sprinkle on the people, and all the other containers. Then they must spread over all those things a nice covering made from the skins of goats. Then they must insert into the rings at the sides of the altar the poles for carrying it.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>“Then Aaron and his sons have finished covering all these sacred things, the Israeli people will be ready to move to a new location. The descendants of Kohath must come and carry all the sacred things to the next place where you Israelis will set up your tents. But the descendants of Kohath must not touch any of these sacred items, because they will immediately die if they touch them. They are the ones who will carry these things, but they must not touch them.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>“Aaron’s son Eleazar will have the work of taking care of the olive oil for the lamps, the nice-smelling incense, the grain which will be burned on the altar each day, and the olive oil for anointing the priests. Eleazar is the one who will supervise the work that is done at the Sacred Tent and the men who take care of everything that is in it.”</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>“Then Yahweh said to Aaron and Moses/me, <sup>18-20</sup>“When the descendants of Kohath approach the sacred items in the Sacred Tent to take them to another location, Aaron and his sons must always go in with them and show each of them what work to do and what things to carry. But the descendants of Kohath must not enter the Sacred Tent at any other time and look at the things that are in it. If they do that, I will get rid of all the descendants of Kohath.”</p><p>The work of the men descended from Gershon</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>Yahweh also said to Moses/me, <sup>22</sup>“Write down the names of all the men who belong to the clans descended from the Gershon division of the descendants of Levi. <sup>23</sup>Write the names of the men who are between 30 and 50 years old. They will be men who will also work at the Sacred Tent.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>“This is the work that they must do and the things that they must carry when you move to a new location: <sup>25</sup>They must carry the curtains of the Sacred Tent; they must carry the Sacred Tent and all the things that cover it, including the nice outer covering made from skins of goats, and the curtain which is at the entrance of the Sacred Tent. <sup>26</sup>They must also carry the curtains that form the wall that surrounds the courtyard that surrounds the Sacred Tent and the altar, the curtain that is at the entrance to the courtyard, and the ropes that fasten the curtains. They must also do the packing and loading of these things. <sup>27</sup>Aaron and his sons will supervise the work of all the descendants of Gershom. That work includes carrying those things and doing other work that is necessary for moving them. They must tell each of the descendants of Gershom what things they must carry. <sup>28</sup>Those are the tasks that you must give to the men who belong to the clans descended from Gershom. Aaron’s son Ithamar is the one who will supervise their work.</p><p>The work of the men descended from Merari</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>Count also the men who belong to the clans descended from Levi’s son Merari. <sup>30</sup>Write the names of the men who are between 30 and 50 years old. They will be men who will also work at the Sacred Tent. <sup>31</sup>Their work will be to carry the frames that hold up the tent, the crossbars, the posts that hold up the curtains, and the bases. <sup>32</sup>They must also carry the posts for the curtains that form the walls of the courtyard and the bases for the posts, the tent pegs, and the ropes to fasten the curtains. Tell each man what things he must carry. <sup>33</sup>Those are the tasks that the descendants of Merari must do at the Sacred Tent. Aaron’s son Ithamar is the one who will supervise them.”</p><p>Summary of the counting of the descendants of Levi</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>So Aaron and Moses/I and the Israeli leaders counted the descendants of Kohath, writing also the names of their clans and family groups. <sup>35</sup>They/We counted all the men who were between 30 and 50 years old who were able to work at the Sacred Tent. <sup>36</sup>The total was 2,750 men. <sup>37</sup>They were the descendants of Kohath who were able to work at the Sacred Tent. Aaron and Moses/I counted them just as Yahweh had commanded Moses/me.</p><p>
    <sup>38</sup>They/We also counted the descendants of Gershon, writing also the names of their clans and family groups. <sup>39</sup>They/We counted all the men who were between 30 and 50 years old who were able to work at the Sacred Tent. <sup>40</sup>The total was 2,630 men. <sup>41</sup>They were the descendants of Gershon who were able to work at the Sacred Tent. Aaron and Moses/I counted them as Yahweh had commanded.</p><p>
    <sup>42</sup>They/We also counted the descendants of Merari, writing also the names of their clans and family groups. <sup>43</sup>They/We counted all the men who were between 30 and 50 years old who were able to work at the Sacred Tent. <sup>44</sup>The total was 3,200 men. <sup>45</sup>They were the descendants of Merari who were able to work. Aaron and Moses/I counted them as Yahweh had commanded Moses/me.</p><p>
    <sup>46</sup>So Aaron and Moses/I and the Israeli leaders counted all the descendants of Levi, writing also the names of their clans and family groups. <sup>47</sup>They/We counted all the men who were between 30 and 50 years old. They were ones who were able to work at the Sacred Tent and who carried the tent and everything that was connected with it. <sup>48</sup>The total was 8,580 men. <sup>49</sup>They/We completed the counting of all the descendants of Levi, as Yahweh had commanded Moses/me. And they/we told each man what work he was to do and what things he must carry when they moved to a new location.</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-5"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-5">5</h3></a>
<p>Expelling those who were ritually impure</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh said to Moses/me, <sup>2</sup>“Tell this to the Israeli people: ‘You must send away from your ◄camp/area where you have your tents► any man or woman who has leprosy and anyone who has a discharge of some fluid from his body, and anyone who has become unacceptable to God because of having touched a corpse. <sup>3</sup>Send them away from there in order that they will not touch people in the camp area where I live among you and cause them to become unacceptable to me.’” <sup>4</sup>So Moses/I told that to the Israeli people, and the Israeli people obeyed what Yahweh commanded Moses/me.</p><p>Paying for committing crimes</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Yahweh also told Moses/me, <sup>6</sup>“Tell this to the Israeli people: ‘If someone ◄commits a crime against/does something wrong to► another person, I consider that that person has done wrong to me. <sup>7</sup>That person must confess that he or she is guilty, and he or she must pay to the person to whom wrong was done what others consider to be a suitable/proper payment for what he has done, and he must pay an extra 20 percent. <sup>8</sup>If the person against whom the wrong was done has died and there is no relative to whom the money can be paid, then the money belongs to me, and it must be paid to the priest. In addition, the one who did the wrong must give a male sheep to the priest to sacrifice in order that ◄that person’s sin may be forgiven/I can forgive that person for his sin►. <sup>9</sup>All the sacred offerings that the Israelis bring to the priest belong to the priest. <sup>10</sup>The priest can keep those gifts.’”</p><p>Suspecting a wife of committing adultery</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Yahweh also said this to Moses/me: <sup>12</sup>“Tell this to the Israeli people: ‘Suppose a man thinks that his wife has slept with another man, <sup>13</sup>but neither he nor anyone else knows if it is true or not, because no one saw her doing that. <sup>14</sup>But if the woman’s husband is jealous, and if he suspects that she has committed adultery, and he wants to know whether that is true or not, <sup>15</sup>he should take his wife to the priest. He must take along as an offering two quarts/liters of barley flour. The priest must not pour olive oil or incense on it, because this is an offering that the man has brought because he ◄is jealous/wants his wife to sleep only with him►. It is an offering to find out if she is guilty or not. Neither olive oil nor incense should be used because are associated with joy and this is not a time for joy.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>The priest must tell the woman to stand in front of the altar in my presence. <sup>17</sup>He must put some sacred water in a clay jar, and then he must put some dirt from the floor of the Sacred Tent into the water. <sup>18</sup>He must untie/unfasten the woman’s hair. Then he must put in her hands the grain that her jealous husband is offering to determine whether she has committed adultery or not. The priest must hold the bowl that contains bitter water that will cause ◄the woman to be cursed/bad things to happen to the woman► if she is guilty. <sup>19</sup>The priest must require her to solemnly declare that she will tell the truth. Then he must say to her, “Has another man had sex [EUP] with you? Have you faithfully slept only with your husband or not? If you have not slept with another man, nothing bad will happen to you if you drink the water. <sup>20</sup>But if you have had sex with another man, Yahweh will curse you. <sup>21-22</sup>Your womb will shrivel up and your stomach will swell up. You will never be able to give birth to children, and as a result, everyone will curse you and avoid you. If you have committed adultery, when you drink this water, that is what will happen to you.” Then the woman must answer, “If I am guilty, I will not object if that happens.”</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>‘Then the priest must write with ink on a small scroll these ◄curses/bad things that will happen to her if she is guilty► and then wash the ink off into the bitter water. <sup>24-25</sup>The priest must take from her the offering of barley flour that she is holding, and lift it up to dedicate it to me. Then he must put it on the altar <sup>26</sup>and burn part of it as a sacrifice. Then the woman must drink the bitter water. <sup>27</sup>If the woman has committed adultery, the water will cause her to suffer greatly. Her stomach will swell up and her womb will shrink, and she will be unable to give birth to children. And then her ◄relatives/fellow Israelis► will curse her. <sup>28</sup>But if she ◄is innocent/has not committed adultery►, her body will not be harmed, and she will still be able to give birth to children.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>‘That is the ritual that must be performed when a woman who is married has been unfaithful to her husband, <sup>30</sup>or when a man is jealous and suspects that his wife has had sex with another man. The priest must tell that woman to stand at the altar in my presence and obey these instructions. <sup>31</sup>Even if the woman has not done what the husband suspected, he will not be punished [MTY] for doing something wrong by bringing his wife to the priest. But if his wife is guilty, she will suffer as a result.’”</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-6"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-6">6</h3></a>
<p>Rules about Nazir-men</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh also said this to Moses/me: <sup>2</sup>“Tell this to the Israeli people: ‘If any of you wants to make a solemn promise to dedicate himself to belong to me in a special way, after you obey these instructions, you will be called a Nazir-man, which means “dedicated man”. <sup>3</sup>You must not drink any wine or other alcoholic/fermented drink. You must not drink any vinegar made from wine or from any other alcoholic/fermented drink. You must not drink grape juice or eat grapes or raisins. <sup>4</sup>You must not eat anything that comes from grapevines, not even the skins or seeds of grapes, during the time that you are a Nazir-man.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>‘Even your hair will be dedicated to me during the time that you area Nazir-man, so you must never allow anyone to cut your hair. Until the time that your solemn promise to dedicate yourself to me is ended, you must allow your hair to grow long. <sup>6</sup>And you must not go near a corpse during the time that you are a Nazir-man. <sup>7</sup>Even if the person who died is your father or your mother or your brother or your sister, you must not cause yourself to become unacceptable to me by coming close to the corpse. Your long hair [MTY] shows that you belong to me in a special way, so you must not cut your hair. <sup>8</sup>You are required to keep doing this all the time that you are dedicated to me in this special way.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>‘If anyone dies very suddenly when he is near you, then your hair that you have dedicated to me is no longer sacred. So you must wait seven days and then shave it all off. Then you must perform a special ritual to cause yourself to become acceptable to me again. <sup>10</sup>The next day you must bring two doves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance of the Sacred Tent. <sup>11</sup>‘The priest must kill the birds and offer them as sacrifices. One of them will be an offering to enable me to forgive you for the sins you have committed, and the other will be an offering that is burned completely to please me. After the priest burns them on the altar, I will forgive you for having come close to a corpse, and when your hair grows again it will be dedicated to me again. <sup>12</sup>The amount of time that you were set apart for me the previous time does not count, because you had become unacceptable to me by coming close to a corpse during the time that you were a Nazir-man. So you must again make a solemn promise to dedicate yourself to me for the entire amount of time that you indicated the previous time. And you must also sacrifice a one-year-old lamb for not doing what you were required to do.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>‘When the time that you promised to dedicate yourself to me is ended, go to the entrance of the Sacred Tent <sup>14</sup>and offer as sacrifices to me three animals that have no defects: Offer a one-year-old ram that will be burned completely, a one-year-old female lamb as a sacrifice to enable me to forgive your sins, and one full-grown ram as a sacrifice to maintain fellowship with me.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>‘When you bring those animals, you must also bring some wine to offer as a sacrifice. And you must also bring a basket of bread that you have made with very good flour and olive oil. But you must not put any yeast in the bread. Also brush/spread some olive oil on some thin wafers and bring them to the priest.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>‘The priest will put the young lamb and the young ram on the altar and completely burn them, in order that I will be pleased and will forgive you for your sins. <sup>17</sup>Then he will kill the full-grown ram as an offering to restore fellowship with me, and he will also burn on the altar some of the bread and the grain and wine.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>‘After that, you must stand at the entrance of the Sacred Tent and shave off your hair. Then you must put that hair in the fire that is under the animal that has been sacrificed on the altar to maintain fellowship with me.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>‘The meat from the ram’s shoulder must be boiled. After it is cooked, the priest will take it along with one of the loaves of bread and one wafer which has been brushed with olive oil, and he will put them in your hands. <sup>20</sup>Then the priest will take them back and lift them up high to dedicate them to me. They now belong to the priest, and he is permitted to eat some of the meat from the ram’s shoulder and from its ribs and from one of its thighs, because that meat is his share of the sacrifice. After that, you will no longer be a Nazir-man, and you will again be permitted to drink wine.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>‘Those are the regulations about the offerings that Nazir-men solemnly promise to bring to me to end their time of being dedicated to me. They must bring these offerings, but if they want to, they may bring additional offerings. And they must do everything that they solemnly promised to do when they dedicated themselves to me.’”</p><p>The blessing for the people</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>Yahweh also said to Moses/me, <sup>23</sup>“Tell Aaron and his sons that when they ask me to bless the people, they must say,</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>‘I desire that Yahweh will bless you</p><p>and protect you,</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>and that he will smile at you</p><p>and act kindly toward you,</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>and that he will be good to you [IDM]</p><p>and cause things to go well for you.’”</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>Then Yahweh said, “If Aaron and his sons ask me to bless the Israeli people, truly I will bless them.”</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-7"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-7">7</h3></a>
<p>The offerings brought to the Sacred Tent</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>When Moses/I had finished setting up the Sacred Tent, he/I dedicated [MTY] it to Yahweh. He/I also dedicated the things that are inside the tent, and the altar for burning sacrifices, and all the things that would be used at the altar. <sup>2</sup>Then the leaders of the twelve Israeli tribes, the same men who had helped Aaron and Moses/me to count the men who could fight in battles, <sup>3</sup>came to the tent, bringing gifts to Yahweh. They brought six sturdy/large carts and twelve oxen, one ox from each of the leaders and a cart from each of the two leaders.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, <sup>5</sup>“Accept these gifts, in order that the descendants of Levi can use them for carrying the sacred items that are here at the Sacred Tent.”</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>So Moses/I took the carts and oxen and gave them to the descendants of Levi. <sup>7</sup>He/I gave two carts and four oxen to the descendants of Gershon for their work, <sup>8</sup>and he/I gave four carts and eight oxen to the descendants of Merari for their work. Aaron’s son Ithamar was the supervisor of all their work. <sup>9</sup>But he/I did not give any carts or oxen to the descendants of Kohath, because they took care of the sacred items that were to be carried on their shoulders, not on carts.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>On the day that the altar was dedicated [MTY], the twelve leaders brought other gifts to be dedicated and put them in front of the altar. <sup>11</sup>Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Each of the next twelve days one leader should bring his gifts for the dedication of the altar.”</p><p>
    <sup>12-83</sup>These are the gifts that each of the leaders brought:</p><p>—a silver dish that weighed ◄more than three pounds/1.5 kg.►, and a silver bowl that weighed ◄almost two pounds/800 grams►, both of which were full of good flour and mixed with olive oil to be offerings of grain; they both were weighed using the standard scales;</p><p>—a small gold dish that weighed ◄four ounces/14 grams►, filled with incense;</p><p>—a young bull, a full-grown ram, and a one-year-old ram, to be sacrifices to be completely burned on the altar;</p><p>—a goat to be sacrificed to enable me to forgive the people for the sins they have committed;</p><p>—and two bulls, five full-grown rams, five male goats, and five rams that were one-year-old, to be sacrifices to maintain the people’s fellowship with Yahweh.</p><p>This was the order in which the leaders brought their gifts:</p><p>on the first day, Nahshon, son of Amminadab from the tribe of Judah brought his gifts;</p><p>on the next/second day, Nethanel, son of Zuar, from the tribe of Issachar;</p><p>on the next/third day, Eliab, son of Helon, from the tribe of Zebulun;</p><p>on the next/fourth day, Elizur, son of Shedeur, from the tribe of Reuben;</p><p>on the next/fifth day, Shelumiel, son of Jurishhaddai, from the tribe of Simeon;</p><p>on the next/sixth day, Eliasaph, son of Deuel, from the tribe of Gad;</p><p>on the next/seventh day, Elishama, son of Ammihud, from the tribe of Ephraim;</p><p>on the next/eighth day, Gamaliel, son of Pedahzur, from the tribe of Manasseh;</p><p>on the next/ninth day, Abidan, son of Gideoni, from the tribe of Benjamin;</p><p>on the next/tenth day, Ahiezer, son of Ammishaddai, from the tribe of Dan;</p><p>on the next/eleventh day, Pagiel, son of Acran, from the tribe of Asher;</p><p>on the next/twelfth day, Ahira, son of Enam, from the tribe of Naphtali.</p><p>
    <sup>84-88</sup>When the altar was dedicated to Yahweh, those twelve leaders brought these gifts:</p><p>—twelve silver plates and twelve silver bowls, weighing a total of about ◄60 pounds/27.6 kg.►, each of them being weighed on the scales kept in the Sacred Tent;</p><p>—twelve gold dishes filled with incense, weighing a total of about ◄three pounds/1.4 kg.►, each being weighed on those same scales;</p><p>—twelve bulls, twelve full-grown rams, and twelve one-year-old rams, to be sacrifices that were completely burned, along with the grain offerings;</p><p>—twelve goats to be sacrificed to forgive the people for the sins they have committed;</p><p>—and 24 bulls, 60 full-grown rams, 60 goats, and 60 rams that were one-year-old, to be sacrifices to maintain the people’s fellowship with Yahweh.</p><p>
    <sup>89</sup>Whenever Moses/I entered the Sacred Tent to talk with Yahweh, he/I heard Yahweh’s voice speaking between the two images of creatures with wings that were above the lid of the sacred chest.</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-8"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-8">8</h3></a>
<p>Aaron set up the lampstand</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh said to Moses/me, <sup>2</sup>“Tell Aaron to put the seven lamps on the lampstand and place them in such a way that they shine toward the front of the lampstand.”</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>So Moses/I told him what Yahweh said, and he did that. <sup>4</sup>The lampstand had been made from gold that had been hammered from one large lump of gold, from its base to the decorations at the top that resembled flowers. The lampstand was made exactly like Yahweh had told Moses/me that it should be made.</p><p>Instructions for dedicating the descendants of Levi</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Yahweh also said to Moses/me, <sup>6</sup>“You must cause the descendants of Levi to be acceptable to me by setting them apart from the other Israeli people. <sup>7</sup>Do that by sprinkling them with water which will symbolize their being freed/cleansed from the guilt of their sins. Then they must shave off all the hair on their bodies and wash their clothes. <sup>8</sup>Then they must bring to the Sacred Tent one bull and some grain mixed with olive oil. Those things will be burned as sacrifices. They must also bring another bull that will enable me to forgive them  for the sins they have committed. <sup>9</sup>Then you must summon all the Israeli people to come together in front of the Sacred Tent, to gather around the descendants of Levi. <sup>10</sup>Then the Israeli people must lay their hands on the descendants of Levi. <sup>11</sup>Aaron must then present them to me to be a gift from the Israeli people, in order that they can work for me at the Sacred Tent.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>“After that, the descendants of Levi must place their hands on the heads of the two bulls. Then the bulls will be killed and burned on the altar. One will be an offering to enable me to forgive them for the sins they have committed, and the other will be completely burned to please me. <sup>13</sup>The descendants of Levi must stand at the altar in front of Aaron and his sons, and you must then dedicate to me the descendants of Levi. <sup>14</sup>This ritual will show that the descendants of Levi are set apart from the other Israelis and that they belong to me.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>“After the descendants of Levi have been made acceptable to me, and presented to me like a special offering, they may start to work at the Sacred Tent. <sup>16</sup>They will belong to me. They will work for me as substitutes for the firstborn males of all the Israelis, who also belong to me. <sup>17</sup>All the firstborn males in Israel, both the people and the animals, are mine. When I caused all the firstborn sons of the people of Egypt to die, I ◄spared/did not kill► the firstborn males of the Israelis. I set them apart to belong to me. I said that the firstborn males of all their domestic animals would also belong to me. <sup>18</sup>But now I have chosen the descendants of Levi to take the places of the firstborn males of other Israelis. <sup>19</sup>I have appointed the descendants of Levi to help Aaron and his sons at the Sacred Tent, as Aaron and his sons offer the sacrifices so that the Israeli people’s sins will be forgiven, and to prevent the Israelis from coming close to the tent with the result that a plague would cause many of them to become sick and die.”</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>Aaron and Moses/I and the other Israelis helped the descendants of Levi to do everything that Yahweh had commanded. <sup>21</sup>The descendants of Levi sprinkled themselves with water to symbolize that they had been freed/cleansed from the guilt of their sins, and they washed their clothes. Then Aaron brought them to the altar to present them to Yahweh, and he offered sacrifices to cleanse them from the guilt of their sins and cause them to become acceptable to Yahweh. <sup>22</sup>After that, the descendants of Levi started to work at the Sacred Tent to assist Aaron and his sons. They did that just as Yahweh had commanded Moses/me.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>Yahweh also said this to Moses/me: <sup>24</sup>“The descendants of Levi who are between 25 and 50 years old will work at the Sacred Tent. <sup>25</sup>But after they become 50 years old, they must ◄retire/not do that work any more►. <sup>26</sup>They may help the other descendants of Levi to do their work at the Sacred Tent, but they must not do the work themselves. That is what you must tell them about the work they will do.”</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-9"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-9">9</h3></a>
<p>They celebrated Passover again</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>One year after the Israelis left Egypt, during the month of March, while they were in the Sinai Desert, Yahweh said to Moses/me, <sup>2</sup>“Tell the Israeli people that they must celebrate the Passover Festival again. <sup>3</sup>They must do it on the fourteenth day of this month, early in the evening, and they must obey all the instructions about it that I gave you previously.”</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>So Moses/I told the people what Yahweh had said about celebrating the Passover. <sup>5</sup>The people celebrated it, there in the Sinai Desert, in the evening of the fourteenth day of the month, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses/me.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>But some of the Israeli people had touched a corpse, and as a result they had become unfit to celebrate the Passover. So they asked Aaron and Moses/me, <sup>7</sup>“It is true that we have touched a corpse. But why should that prevent us from celebrating the Passover Festival and offering sacrifices to Yahweh like everyone else [RHQ]?”</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Moses/I replied, “Wait here until I go into the Sacred Tent and find out what Yahweh says about it.”</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    So Moses/I went into the tent and asked Yahweh what he/I should tell the people, and this is what Yahweh said: <sup>10</sup>“Tell this to the Israeli people: If any of you or your descendants touch a corpse and as a result become unacceptable to me, or if you are away from home on a long trip at the time to celebrate the Passover, you will still be permitted to celebrate it. <sup>11</sup>But you must celebrate it exactly one month later, early in the evening of the fourteenth day of that month. Eat the meat of the lamb for the Passover Festival with bread that is baked without yeast and eat bitter herbs. <sup>12</sup>Do not leave any of it until the next morning. And do not break any of the lamb’s bones. Obey all the regulations about celebrating the Passover. <sup>13</sup>But if any of you has not done anything that would make you unfit to celebrate the Passover Festival, and you are not away from home on a long trip, and you do not sacrifice to me at the proper time, you will no longer be allowed to associate with my people. ◄You will be punished/I will punish you►.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>Foreigners who live among you may also celebrate the Passover Festival, if they obey all my commands concerning it.”</p><p>A cloud covered the Sacred Tent</p><p>
    <sup>15-16</sup>On the day that the Sacred Tent was set up, a cloud covered it. From the time that the sun set until the time that the sun rose the next day, the cloud resembled a huge fire. And that is what happened every day that we/the Israelis were in the desert. <sup>17</sup>When the cloud rose up and started to move to a new location, we/they followed it. When the cloud stopped, we/the Israelis stopped there and set up their tents. <sup>18</sup>We/They traveled when Yahweh, by causing the cloud to move or stop, signaled to us/them when to move and when to stop. When the cloud stayed over the Sacred Tent, we/the Israelis stayed at that place. <sup>19</sup>Sometimes the cloud stayed over the tent for a long time, so when that happened, we/they did not travel. <sup>20</sup>Sometimes the cloud remained over the tent for only a few days. We/The people stopped and set up our/their tents as Yahweh commanded us/them, and we/they traveled to a new location when Yahweh commanded us/them to do that. <sup>21</sup>Sometimes the cloud stayed in one place for only one day. When that happened, when the cloud rose up into the sky the next morning, then we/they traveled. Whenever the cloud moved, during the day or during the night, we/they traveled. <sup>22</sup>If the cloud stayed over the Sacred Tent for two days, or for a month, or for a year, during that time we/they stayed where we/they were. But when the cloud rose up into the sky, we/they started to travel. <sup>23</sup>When Yahweh commanded us/them to stop and set up our/their tents, we/they did that. When he told us/them to move, we/they moved. We/They did whatever Yahweh told Moses/me that we/they should do.</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-10"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-10">10</h3></a>
<p>The silver trumpets</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh also told Moses/me, <sup>2</sup>“Tell someone to make two trumpets by hammering each one from one lump of silver. Blow the trumpets to summon the people to come together and also to signal that they must move their tents to a new location. <sup>3</sup>If both trumpets are blown, it means that everyone must gather together at the entrance of the Sacred Tent. <sup>4</sup>If only one trumpet is blown, it means that only the twelve leaders of the tribes must gather together. <sup>5</sup>If the trumpets are blown loudly, the tribes that are to the east of the Sacred Tent should start to travel. <sup>6</sup>When the trumpets are blown loudly the second time, the tribes that are to the south should start to travel. The loud blasts on the trumpet will signal that they should start to travel. <sup>7</sup>When you want only to gather the people together, blow the trumpets, but do not blow them as loudly.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>“The priests who are descended from Aaron are the ones who should blow the trumpets. That is a regulation that will never be changed. <sup>9</sup>When you fight against enemies who attack you in your own land, tell the priests to blow the trumpets loudly. I, Yahweh, your God, will hear that, and I will rescue you from your enemies. <sup>10</sup>Also tell the priests to blow the trumpets when the people are happy, and at the festivals each year, and at the times when they celebrate the new moon each month. Tell them to blow the trumpets when the people bring offerings that will be completely burned, and when they bring offerings to maintain fellowship with me. If they do that, it will help you to remember that I, Yahweh your God, will help you.”</p><p>The Israelis traveled</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>On the twentieth day of May in the second year after the/we Israelis left Egypt, the cloud rose up from above the Sacred Tent. <sup>12</sup>So we/the Israelis traveled from the Sinai Desert, and we/they continued traveling north until the cloud stopped in the Paran Desert. <sup>13</sup>That was the first time we/they moved, obeying the instructions that Yahweh had given to Moses/me to tell them.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>The group that went first, carrying their flag/banner, was the group from the tribe of Judah. Nahshon, the son of Amminadab, was their leader. <sup>15</sup>The group from the tribe of Issachar followed them. Nethanel, the son of Zuar, was their leader. <sup>16</sup>The group from the tribe of Zebulun went next. Eliab, the son of Helon, was their leader. <sup>17</sup>Then they dismantled the Sacred Tent, and the descendants of Gershon and Merari carried it, and they went next.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>The group from the tribe of Reuben went next, carrying their flag. Elizur, the son of Shedeur, was their leader. <sup>19</sup>The group from the tribe of Simeon was next. Shelumiel, the son of Zurishaddai, was their leader. <sup>20</sup>The group from the tribe of Gad was next. Eliasaph, the son of Deuel, was their leader. <sup>21</sup>The group descended from Kohath was next. They carried the sacred items from the Sacred Tent. The Sacred Tent itself was set up at the new location before they arrived there.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>The group from the tribe of Ephraim was next, carrying their flag. Elishama, the son of Ammihud, was their leader. <sup>23</sup>The group from the tribe of Manasseh went next. Gamaliel, the son of Pedahzur, was their leader. <sup>24</sup>The group from the tribe of Benjamin, went next. Abidan, the son of Gideoni, was their leader.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>The ones who went last were the group from the tribe of Dan, carrying their flag. Ahiezer, the son of Ammishaddai, was their leader. <sup>26</sup>The group from the tribe of Asher went next. Pagiel, the son of Ocran, was their leader. <sup>27</sup>The group from the tribe of Naphtali went last. Ahira, the son of Enan, was their leader. <sup>28</sup>That was the order in which the groups of Israeli tribes traveled.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>One day Moses/I said to his/my brother-in-law Hobab, the son of Reuel from the Midian people-group, “We are on the way to the place that Yahweh promised to give to us. Come with us, and we will take good care of you, because Yahweh has promised to do good things for us Israeli people.”</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>But Hobab replied, “No, I will not go with you. I want to return to my own land and to my own family.”</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>But Moses/I said, “Please do not leave us. You know the places where we can set up our tents in this desert, and you can guide us. <sup>32</sup>Come with us. We will share with you all the good things that Yahweh gives to us.”</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>
    So Hobab agreed to go with them. The Israelis left Sinai Mountain, which they called Yahweh’s Mountain, and they walked for three days. The men carrying the sacred chest went in front of the other people for those three days, and they kept looking for a place to set up their tents. <sup>34</sup>The cloud sent by Yahweh was over them every day.</p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>Each morning when the men who were carrying the sacred chest started to walk, Moses/I said,</p><p>“Yahweh, arise!</p><p>Scatter your enemies!</p><p>Cause those who hate you to run away from you!”</p><p>
    <sup>36</sup>And each time the men stopped to set down the sacred chest, Moses/I said,</p><p>“Yahweh, stay close to the thousands of us Israelis!”</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-11"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-11">11</h3></a>
<p>Yahweh sent fire because the people complained</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>One day the people complained to Yahweh about their troubles. When Yahweh heard what they were saying, he became angry. So he sent a fire which burned among the people at the edge of their camp. <sup>2</sup>Then the people cried out to Moses/me, and he/I prayed to Yahweh. Then the fire stopped burning. <sup>3</sup>So they called that place Taberah, which means ‘burning’, because the fire from Yahweh had burned among them.</p><p>Seventy leaders were chosen to help Moses</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Then some troublemakers from other people-groups who were traveling with the Israelis began to want better food. And when they started complaining the Israeli people also started to complain. <sup>5</sup>They said, “We wish we had some meat! <sup>6</sup>We remember the fish that we ate while we were in Egypt, fish that was given to us without ◄cost/asking us to pay for it►. And we had all the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic that we wanted. But now we do not have any desire to eat, because all we have to eat is this manna!”</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>The manna resembled small white seeds. <sup>8</sup>Each morning the people would go out and gather some from the surface of the ground. Then they made flour by grinding it or pounding it with stones. Then they added water and boiled it in a pot, or they made flat cakes with it and baked them. The cakes tasted like bread that was baked with olive oil. <sup>9</sup>Each night the manna came down on their ground where their tents were, like dew from the sky.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Moses/I heard all the Israeli people complaining as they were standing in the entrances of their tents. Yahweh became very angry, and Moses/I was also very perturbed. <sup>11</sup>He/I went into the Sacred Tent and asked Yahweh, “Why have you caused me, your servant, to experience this trouble [RHQ]? Act mercifully to me! What wrong have I done, with the result that you have appointed me to take care of all of these people [RHQ]? <sup>12</sup>◄I am not their father./Am I their father?► [RHQ] Why have you told me to take care of them like a woman carries around her baby and ◄nurses it/gives it her milk► [MET, RHQ]? How can I take them to the land that you promised to give to our ancestors [RHQ]? <sup>13</sup>Where can I get meat to feed all these people? They keep complaining to me, saying, ‘Give us some meat to eat!’ <sup>14</sup>I cannot carry all these people’s burdens by myself! They are like a heavy load [MET], and I cannot carry this very heavy load any more. <sup>15</sup>If you intend to act like this toward me, kill me now. If you are really concerned about me, be kind to me and kill me to end my misery of trying to take care of them!”</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Summon 70 men whom you know are leaders among the Israeli people. Tell them to stand with you in front of the Sacred Tent. <sup>17</sup>I will come down and talk with you there. Then I will take some of the power of my Spirit that you have, and I will put that power on them also. They will help you to take care of some of the things that the people are concerned about, in order that you will not need to do it alone.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>“Furthermore, say to the people, ‘Make yourselves acceptable to me, and tomorrow you will have meat to eat. You were complaining, and Yahweh heard you when you were saying, “We want some meat to eat. We had better food in Egypt!” Now Yahweh will give you some meat, and you will eat it. <sup>19</sup>You will eat meat not only for one or two days, nor only for five or ten or 20 days. <sup>20</sup>You will eat meat every day for one month, and then you will loathe/despise it, and it will cause you to want to vomit. This will happen because you have rejected Yahweh who is here among you, and you have wailed in his presence, saying “We would have had better food to eat if we had not left Egypt [RHQ].”’”</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>But Moses/I replied to Yahweh, “There are 600,000 men plus women and children here with me, so ◄why do you say ‘I will give them plenty of meat every day for a month!’?/it does not seem right for you to say ‘I will give them plenty of meat every day for a month!’► [RHQ] <sup>22</sup>Even if we killed all the sheep and cattle, that would not [RHQ] be enough to provide meat for all of them Even if we caught all the fish in the sea and gave it to them, that would not be enough [RHQ]!” <sup>23</sup>But Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Do you think that I [SYN] have no power? You will now see if I can do what I say I will do.”</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>So Moses/I went out from the Sacred Tent and told the people what Yahweh had said. Then he/I gathered together the 70 leaders and told them to stand around the Sacred Tent.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>Then Yahweh came down in the cloud that was above the tent and spoke to Moses/me. He took some of the power of the Spirit that he had given to Moses/me and gave it to the 70 leaders. By means of the power of the Spirit within them, they ◄prophesied/spoke messages that Yahweh gave them►, but they did that only once.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>Two of the leaders whom Moses/I appointed, Eldad and Medad, were not there when the rest of them gathered together. They had not left their tents to go and stand around the Sacred Tent. But Yahweh’s Spirit came on them also, and they started to ◄prophesy/speak messages from Yahweh►. <sup>27</sup>So a young man ran and told Moses/me, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in all their tents!”</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>Joshua, who had helped Moses/me since he was a young man, said, “Sir, tell them to stop doing that!”</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>But Moses/I replied, “◄Are you worried that they might injure my reputation/Do you think that I want to be the only one who prophesies► [RHQ]? I wish that all Yahweh’s people could ◄prophesy/speak messages from Yahweh►. I wish that Yahweh would give the power of his Spirit to all of them!” <sup>30</sup>Then Moses/I and all the leaders went back to their/our tents.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>Then Yahweh sent a strong wind from the sea. It blew quail into the area all around the camp for miles in every direction, and caused the quail to fall onto the ground. They were piled up on the ground about ◄3 feet/1 meter► high! <sup>32</sup>So the people went out and gathered up the quail all that day, and all that night, and all of the following day. It seemed as though everyone gathered at least 50 bushels! They spread the quail out on the ground all around the camp, so that the quail would dry out. <sup>33</sup>Then they cooked them and started to eat them. But while they were still eating the meat [MTY], Yahweh showed that he was very angry with them. He struck them with a severe plague/sickness, and many people died. <sup>34</sup>The people who died and were buried were the ones who had said they wanted to eat meat like they had formerly eaten in Egypt. So they called that place Kibroth-Hattaavah, which means ‘graves of those who craved’.</p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>From there, the Israelis continued walking east until they arrived at Hazeroth town, where they stopped and stayed for a long time.</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-12"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-12">12</h3></a>
<p>Miriam and Aaron were jealous of Moses</p><p>
    <sup>1-2</sup>
    Moses’/My older sister Miriam and his/my older brother Aaron were saying this: “Is Moses the only one to whom Yahweh has spoken messages to tell to us [RHQ]? Does Yahweh not speak messages to us two also?” They told people that they were saying that because Moses/I had married a woman who was a descendant of the Cush people-group, but they were really saying that because they ◄were jealous/did not want Moses/me to be the only leader of the Israeli people►. But Yahweh heard what they were saying.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    The truth was that Moses/I was very humble. He/I was more humble than anyone else on the earth and Moses/I had not appointed himself/myself to be their leader.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>So immediately Yahweh spoke to Moses/me and to Aaron and Miriam. He said, “All three of you must go and stand at the Sacred Tent.” So they/we did that. <sup>5</sup>Then Yahweh descended to the entrance of the tent in a cloud that resembled a huge white pillar. He told Aaron and Miriam to step forward, so they did. <sup>6</sup>Then he said to them,</p><p>“Listen to me!</p><p>When a prophet is among you,</p><p>I usually reveal myself to him by allowing him to see visions,</p><p>and I speak to him in dreams.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>But that is not the way I speak to my servant Moses.</p><p>I trust that he will lead my people well.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>So I talk to him face-to-face.</p><p>I speak to him ◄clearly/using words that he will understand easily►, not using parables.</p><p>He has even seen what I look like.</p><p>So you should be afraid to criticize my servant Moses!”</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Yahweh was very angry with Miriam and Aaron, and he left.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>When the cloud rose up from the Sacred Tent, Aaron looked at Miriam, and he saw that her skin was as white as snow, because she now had leprosy. <sup>11</sup>Aaron said to Moses/me, “My master, please do not punish us for this sin that we have foolishly committed. <sup>12</sup>Do not allow Miriam to be like a baby that is already dead when it is born, whose flesh is already half decayed!”</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>So Moses/I cried out to Yahweh, saying, “God, I plead with you to heal her!”</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>But Yahweh replied, “If her father had rebuked her for doing something wrong by spitting in her face, she would have been ashamed for seven days. She should be ashamed because of what she has done. So send her outside the camp for seven days. Then she will not have leprosy any more, and she may return to the camp.” <sup>15</sup>So they sent her outside the camp for seven days. ◄The people/We► did not move to another location until she returned.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>But after she returned, they/we left Hazeroth and moved north in the Paran Desert and set up their/our tents there.</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-13"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-13">13</h3></a>
<p>Twelve Israeli men explored Canaan</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh said to Moses/me, <sup>2</sup>“Send some men to Canaan land to explore it. That is the land that I will give to you Israelis. Send men who are leaders in their tribes.”</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>So Moses/I did what Yahweh commanded him/me. He/I sent out twelve Israeli men who were all leaders of their tribes. He/I sent them from their/our camp at Paran in the desert. <sup>4</sup>These are the names of the men and the tribes they belonged to:</p><p>Shammua, the son of Zaccur, from the tribe of Reuben;</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Shaphat, the son of Hori, from the tribe of Simeon;</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, from the tribe of Judah;</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Igal, the son of Joseph, from the tribe of Issachar;</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Hoshea, the son of Nun, from the tribe of Ephraim;</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Palti, the son of Raphu, from the tribe of Benjamin;</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Gaddiel, the son of Sodi, from the tribe of Zebulun;</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Gaddi, the son of Susi, from the tribe of Manasseh;</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Ammiel, the son of Gemalli, from the tribe of Dan;</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Sethur, the son of Michael, from the tribe of Asher;</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>Nahbi, the son of Vophsi, from the tribe of Naphtali;</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>and Geuel, the son of Maki, from the tribe of Gad.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>Those are the names of the men whom Moses/I sent out to explore Canaan. Before they left, Moses/I gave Hoshea a new name, Joshua, which means ‘Yahweh is the one who saves.’</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Before Moses/I sent them to explore Canaan, he/I said to them, “Go through the southern part of Canaan, and then go north into the hilly area. <sup>18</sup>See what the land is like. See if the people who live there are strong or weak. See if there are many people or only a few people. <sup>19</sup>Find out what kind of land they live in [RHQ]. Is it good or bad? Find out about the towns in which they live [RHQ]. Do they have walls around them or not? <sup>20</sup>Find out about the soil [RHQ]. Is it ◄fertile/good for growing crops► or not? Find out if there are trees there [RHQ]. Try to bring back some of the fruit that grows in that land.” He/I said that because it was the beginning of the time to harvest grapes.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>So those men went to Canaan. They went through the entire land, from the Zin desert in the south all the way to Rehob town near Lebo-Hamath in the north. <sup>22</sup>In the south, they went to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, huge men descended from Anak, lived. Hebron was a city that was built seven years before Zoan city was built in Egypt. <sup>23</sup>In one valley, they cut from a grapevine one cluster of grapes. Because it was very large, they needed two men to carry it on a pole. They also picked some pomegranates and some figs to carry back to their camp. <sup>24</sup>They called that place Eshcol which means ‘cluster’ because they had cut that huge cluster of grapes there. <sup>25</sup>After they explored the land for 40 days, they returned to their camp.</p><p>The report about Canaan</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>They came to Aaron and Moses/me and the rest of the Israeli people in the desert at Paran. They reported to everyone what they had seen. They also showed them the fruit that they had brought back. <sup>27</sup>But this is what they reported to Moses/me: “We arrived in the land that you sent us to explore. It is truly a beautiful land, and it is very fertile [IDM]. Here is some of the fruit. <sup>28</sup>But the people who live there are very strong. Their cities are large and are surrounded by walls. We even saw some of the huge descendants of Anak there. <sup>29</sup>The descendants of Amalek live in the southern part of the land, and the descendants of Heth, Jebus, and Amor live in the hilly area to the north. The descendants of Canaan live along the coast of the Mediterranean sea and along the Jordan River.”</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>
    When they said that, the people were afraid and started to cry out very loudly. But Caleb told the people who were standing near Moses/me to be quiet. Then he said, “We should go there and take the land, because we are certainly able to conquer it!”</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>But the men who had gone with him said, “No, we cannot attack and defeat those people! They are much stronger than we are!” <sup>32</sup>So those men gave to the Israeli people a bad report about the land that they had explored. They said, “The land that we explored is very large; we cannot conquer it. And all the people whom we saw are very tall. <sup>33</sup>We even saw the descendants of Nephili there. The descendants of Anak whom we saw there are descended from the giant Nephili people. When we saw them, we felt as small as grasshoppers [SIM], and they thought that we looked like grasshoppers too!”</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-14"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-14">14</h3></a>
<p>The Israeli people continued to complain</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>That night, all the Israeli people cried loudly. <sup>2</sup>The next day they all complained to Aaron and Moses/me. All the men said, “We wish that we had died in Egypt, or in this desert! <sup>3</sup>Why is Yahweh bringing us to this land, where we men will be killed with swords? And our wives and children will be taken away to be slaves. Instead of going to Canaan. It would be better for us to return to Egypt!” <sup>4</sup>Then some of them said to each other, “We should choose a leader who will take us back to Egypt!”</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Then Aaron and Moses/I bowed down to pray in front of all the Israeli people who had gathered there. <sup>6</sup>Joshua and Caleb, two of the men who had explored the land, tore their clothes because they were very dismayed. <sup>7</sup>They said to the Israeli people, “The land that we explored is very good. <sup>8</sup>If Yahweh is pleased with us, he will lead us into that very fertile [IDM] land, and he will give it to us. <sup>9</sup>So do not rebel against Yahweh! And do not be afraid of the people in that land! We will ◄gobble them up/completely destroy them► [MET]! They do not have anyone who will protect them, but Yahweh will be with us and help us. So do not be afraid of them!”</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Then all the Israeli people talked about killing Caleb and Joshua by throwing stones at them. But suddenly Yahweh’s glory appeared to them at the Sacred Tent. <sup>11</sup>Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “How long will these people reject me [RHQ]? I am tired of them not believing in what I can do, in spite of all the miracles I have performed among them [RHQ]! <sup>12</sup>So I will cause a ◄plague/widespread sickness► to strike them and get rid of them. But I will cause your descendants to become a great nation. They will be a nation that is much greater and stronger than these people are.”</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>But Moses/I replied to Yahweh, “Please do not do that, because the people of Egypt will hear about it! You brought these Israeli people from Egypt by your great power, <sup>14</sup>and the people of Egypt will tell that to the descendants of Canaan who live in this land. Yahweh, they have already heard about you. They know that you have ◄been with/helped► these people and that they have seen you face-to-face. They have heard that your cloud is like a huge pillar that stays over them, and by using that cloud you lead them during the day, and the cloud becomes like a fire at night to give them light. <sup>15</sup>If you kill these people all at one time, the people-groups who have heard about your power will say, <sup>16</sup>‘Yahweh was not able to bring them into the land that he promised to give to them, so he killed them in the desert.’</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>“So Yahweh, now show that you are very powerful. You said, <sup>18</sup>‘I do not quickly become angry; instead, I love people very much, and I forgive people for having sinned and having disobeyed my laws. But I will always punish [LIT] people who are guilty of doing what is wrong. When parents sin, I will punish them, but I will also punish their children and their grandchildren and their great-grandchildren and their great-great-grandchildren.’ <sup>19</sup>So, because you love people like that, forgive these people for the sins that they have committed, just like you have continued to forgive them ever since they left Egypt.”</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>Then Yahweh replied, “I have forgiven them, as you requested me to. <sup>21</sup>But, just as certainly as I live and that people all over the world can see my ◄glory/glorious power►, I solemnly declare this: <sup>22</sup>All these people saw my glory and all the miracles that I performed in Egypt and in the desert, but they disobeyed me, and many times they tested whether they could continue to do evil things without my punishing them. <sup>23</sup>Because of that, not one of them will see the land that I promised their ancestors that I would give to them. No one who rejected me will see that land. <sup>24</sup>But Caleb, who serves me well, is different from the others. He obeys me completely. So I will bring him into that land that he has already seen, and his descendants will inherit/possess some of it. <sup>25</sup>So, since the descendants of Amalek and Canaan who are living in the valleys in Canaan are very strong, when you leave here tomorrow, instead of traveling toward Canaan, go back along the road through the desert towards the Red Sea.”</p><p>Yahweh punished the Israelis</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>Then Yahweh said to Aaron and Moses/me, <sup>27</sup>“How long will the wicked people of this nation keep complaining about me [RHQ]? I have heard everything that they have grumbled/complained against me. <sup>28</sup>So now tell them this: ‘Just as certainly as I, Yahweh, live, I will do exactly what you said would happen. <sup>29</sup>I will cause all of you to die here in this desert! Because you grumbled about me, none of you who are more than 20 years old and who were counted when Moses counted everyone <sup>30</sup>will enter the land that I solemnly promised to give to you. Only Caleb and Joshua will enter that land. <sup>31</sup>You said that your children would be taken from you to become slaves, but I will take them into the land, and they will enjoy living in the land that you ◄rejected/said that you could not conquer►. <sup>32</sup>But as for you adults, you will die here in this desert. <sup>33</sup>And like shepherds wander around in the desert as they take care of their sheep, your children will wander around in this desert for 40 years. Because you adults were not loyal/faithful to me, your children will suffer until you all die in the desert. <sup>34</sup>You will suffer for your sins for 40 years. That will be one year for each of the 40 days that the twelve men explored Canaan land. And I will be like an enemy to you.’ <sup>35</sup>This will certainly happen because I, Yahweh, have said it! I will do these things to every one in this group who conspired against me. They ◄conspired against/decided together to reject► me here in the desert, and they will all die right here in this desert!”</p><p>
    <sup>36</sup>Then the ten men who had explored Canaan and who had urged the people to rebel against Yahweh by giving reports that discouraged the people <sup>37</sup>were immediately struck with a plague/disease that Yahweh sent, and they died. <sup>38</sup>Of the twelve men who had explored Canaan, only Joshua and Caleb remained alive.</p><p>
    <sup>39</sup>When Moses/I reported to the Israeli people what Yahweh had said, many of them were very sad. <sup>40</sup>So the people got up early the next morning and started to go toward the hilly area in Canaan. They said, “We know that we have sinned, but now we are ready to enter the land that Yahweh promised to give to us.”</p><p>
    <sup>41</sup>But Moses/I said, “Yahweh commanded you to return to the desert, so why are you now disobeying him [RHQ]? It will not ◄succeed/be possible►. <sup>42</sup>Do not try to enter the land now! If you try, your enemies will defeat you, because Yahweh will not ◄be with/help► you. <sup>43</sup>When you begin to fight the descendants of Amalek and Canaan, they will slaughter you! Yahweh will abandon you, because you have abandoned him.”</p><p>
    <sup>44</sup>But even though Moses/I did not leave the camp, and the sacred chest that contained the Ten Commandments was not taken from the camp, the people began to go towards the hilly area in Canaan. <sup>45</sup>Then the descendants of Amalek and Canaan who lived in that hilly area came down and attacked them and chased them as far south as the town of Hormah.</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-15"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-15">15</h3></a>
<p>Instructions about offerings</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Then Yahweh told Moses/me, <sup>2</sup>“Tell this to the Israeli people: When you arrive in the land that I am giving to you, <sup>3</sup>you must offer to me special sacrifices which will be pleasing to me when the priest burns them on the altar. Some of them may be offerings that will be completely burned on the altar. Some of them may be to indicate that you have made a solemn promise to me. Some of them may be offerings that you yourselves have decided to make. Some of them may be offerings at one of the festivals that you celebrate each year. These offerings may be taken from your herds of cattle or from your flocks of sheep and goats. <sup>4</sup>When you give these offerings, you must also bring to me a grain offering of two quarts/liters of nice flour mixed with one quart/liter of olive oil. <sup>5</sup>When you offer a lamb to be a sacrifice to be completely burned, you must also pour on the altar one quart/liter of wine.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>‘When you offer a ram to be a sacrifice, you must also bring an offering of four quarts/liters of finely-ground flour mixed with ◄a third of a gallon/1.3 liters► of olive oil. <sup>7</sup>And also pour on the altar ◄a third of a gallon/1.3 liters► of wine. While they are being burned, the smell will be very pleasing to me.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>‘Sometimes you will offer a young bull to be completely burned on the altar. Sometimes you will offer a sacrifice to indicate that you have made a solemn promise to me. Sometimes you will offer a sacrifice to maintain fellowship with me. <sup>9</sup>When you offer these sacrifices, you must also offer a grain offering of six quarts/liters of finely-ground flour mixed with two quarts/liters of olive oil. <sup>10</sup>Also pour on the altar two quarts/liters of wine to be an offering. While those special gifts are being burned, the smell will be very pleasing to me. <sup>11</sup>Each time someone offers a bull or a ram or a male lamb or a young goat to be a sacrifice, it must be done that way. <sup>12</sup>You must obey these instructions for each animal that you bring to me for an offering.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>‘All of you people who have been Israelis all of your lives must obey these regulations when you offer sacrifices that will be pleasing to me when they are burned on the altar. <sup>14</sup>If any foreigners visit you or live among you, if they also want to bring a sacrifice that will be pleasing to me when it is burned on the altar, they must obey these same instructions. <sup>15</sup>I consider that those who have always been Israelis and those who are foreigners are equal, and so they must all obey the same instructions. All of your descendants must also continue to obey these instructions. <sup>16</sup>You Israelis and the foreigners who live among you must all obey the same instructions.”</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Yahweh also said to Moses/me, <sup>18</sup>“Tell these instructions to the Israeli people: Yahweh says this: ‘When you arrive in the land to which I am taking you, <sup>19</sup>and you eat the crops that are growing there, you must set some of them aside to be a sacred offering to me. <sup>20</sup>Each year set aside some of the first grain that you gather after you have threshed it. Bake a loaf of bread from the first flour that you grind and bring it to me to be a sacred offering. <sup>21</sup>Every year, you and your descendants must continue to make and bring to me a loaf of bread baked [MTY] with flour from the first part of the grain that you harvest.’”</p><p>When people sin unintentionally or deliberately</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>“‘There may be times when you Israelis do not obey all these instructions that I have given to Moses to tell you, but not because you intended to disobey them. <sup>23</sup>There may be times when some of your descendants do not obey all these instructions that I have given to Moses to tell to you. <sup>24</sup>If you or they sin by forgetting to obey these instructions and none of the Israeli people realize that they were doing that, one young bull as an offering for all the people must be brought to the priest. That will be pleasing to me when it is burned on the altar. They must also bring to me a grain offering and an offering of wine, and a male goat, to be sacrificed to enable me to forgive them for the sins they have committed. <sup>25</sup>By offering these sacrifices, the priest will make atonement for all of you Israeli people. Then, as a result of their bringing to me an offering to be burned on the altar, ◄you will be forgiven/I will forgive you►, because you sinned without realizing that you were sinning. <sup>26</sup>You Israeli people and the foreigners who are living among you will all be forgiven.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>If one person commits a sin without realizing that he was sinning, that person must bring to me a female goat to be an offering to enable me to forgive that person for the sins that person has committed. <sup>28</sup>The priest will offer it to be a sacrifice to remove the guilt of that person, and that person will be forgiven. <sup>29</sup>You Israelis and all the foreigners who live among you must obey these same instructions.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>But those who disobey my commands ◄deliberately/because they want to►, both Israelis and the foreigners who live among you, have sinned against me by doing that. So ◄they must be expelled/you must expel them► from your camp. <sup>31</sup>They have despised my commands and deliberately disobeyed them, so they must be punished for their sin by not being allowed to live among you any more.’”</p><p>A man is punished for working on the Sabbath</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>One day, while the Israelis were in the desert, some of them saw a man who was gathering firewood on the Sabbath/rest day. <sup>33</sup>Those who saw him doing that brought him to Aaron and Moses/me and the rest of the Israeli people. <sup>34</sup>They guarded him carefully, because they did not know what to do to punish him. <sup>35</sup>Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “The man must be executed. All of you must kill him by throwing stones at him outside the camp.” <sup>36</sup>So they all took the man outside the camp and killed him by throwing stones at him, as Yahweh had commanded Moses/me that they should do.</p><p>Putting tassels on clothing</p><p>
    <sup>37</sup>Yahweh also said to Moses/me, <sup>38</sup>“Tell this to the Israeli people: You and all your descendants must twist threads together to make tassels, and then attach them with blue cords to the bottom edges of your clothes. <sup>39</sup>When you look at the tassels, you will remember all the instructions that I gave to you, and you will obey them, instead of doing what you desire and as a result causing yourselves to become unacceptable to me. <sup>40</sup>Seeing those tassels will help you to remember that you must obey all my commands and that you must be ◄my holy people/dedicated to me►. <sup>41</sup>Do not forget that I am Yahweh, your God. I am the one who brought you out of Egypt in order that you might belong to me. I am Yahweh, your God.”</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-16"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-16">16</h3></a>
<p>Several men rebelled against Moses</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>One day Korah, who was the son of Izhar and a descendant of Levi’s son Kohath, conspired with Dathan and Abiram, who were the sons of Eliab, and On, who was the son of Peleth. Those three men were from the tribe of Reuben. <sup>2</sup>Korah and those other three men incited 250 other people who were leaders among the Israeli people to join them in rebelling against Moses/me. <sup>3</sup>They came together to criticize Aaron and Moses/me. They said to them/us, “You two are using more authority than you should! Yahweh has set apart all of us Israeli people, and he is with/helping all of us. So why do you act as though you are more important than the rest of us people who belong to Yahweh [RHQ]?”</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>When Moses/I heard what they were saying, he/I prostrated himself/myself on the ground. <sup>5</sup>Then he/I said to Korah and those Israeli leaders who were with Korah, “Tomorrow morning Yahweh will show us whom he has chosen to be his priest, and who is holy and allowed to come near to him. Yahweh will permit only those whom he chooses to come into his presence. <sup>6</sup>So Korah, tomorrow you and those who are with you must prepare your pans to burn incense. <sup>7</sup>Then you must light a fire in them and burn the incense in the presence of Yahweh. Then we will see which one of us Yahweh has chosen to be his holy servant. It is you men who are descendants of Levi who are trying to use more authority than you should!”</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Then Moses/I spoke again to Korah. He/I said, “You men who are descendants of Levi, listen to me! <sup>9</sup>The God of us Israelis has chosen all of you to be close to him in order that you can work for him at his Sacred Tent and serve the people. ◄Is that unimportant/Does that mean nothing► to you [RHQ]? <sup>10</sup>Yahweh has brought you, Korah, and your fellow descendants of Levi, near to himself. Now are you demanding to become priests also? <sup>11</sup>It is really Yahweh against whom you and your fellow descendants of Levi are rebelling. Aaron is not the one about whom you are really complaining [RHQ].”</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Then Moses/I summoned Dathan and Abiram, but they refused to come. They sent a message saying, “We will not come to you! <sup>13</sup>You brought us out of Egypt, which was a very fertile [IDM] land, in order to cause us to die here in this desert. That was bad. But now you are also trying to boss us [RHQ], and that is worse. <sup>14</sup>You have not given us a new land to live in, a land that has good fields and vineyards. You are only trying to [RHQ] trick these people. So we will not come to you.”</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>Then Moses/I became very angry. He/I said to Yahweh, “Do not accept the grain offerings that they have brought. I have not taken anything from them, not even one donkey, and I have never done anything wrong to them, so they have no reason to complain about me.”</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>Then Moses/I said to Korah, “You and all those who are with you must come here tomorrow and stand in front of Yahweh. Aaron will also be here. <sup>17</sup>You and all the 250 men who are with you must each take a pan in which to burn incense, and put incense in it, to burn it to be an offering to Yahweh. Aaron will do the same thing.”</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>So the next day each of those men got a pan to burn incense. They put in it incense and hot coals to light it, and then they all stood at the entrance of the Sacred Tent with Aaron and Moses/me. <sup>19</sup>Then Korah summoned all the people who supported him and who were against Moses/me, and they also gathered at the entrance of the tent. Then the glory of Yahweh appeared to all of them/us, <sup>20</sup>and Yahweh said to Aaron and Moses/me, <sup>21</sup>“Get away from all these people, in order that I can get rid of them immediately!”</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>But Aaron and Moses/I prostrated themselves/ourselves on the ground. We pleaded with Yahweh, saying, “God, you are the one who caused all these people to live [MTY]. Only one of these men has sinned; so, ◄is it right for you to be angry with all the people?/it is not right for you to be angry with all the people!► [RHQ]”</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>Yahweh said to Moses/me, <sup>24</sup>“Okay, but tell all the people to get away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.”</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>So Moses/I stood up and went to the tents of Dathan and Abiram. The Israeli leaders followed him/me. <sup>26</sup>He/I told the people, “Get away from the tents of these wicked men, and do not touch anything that belongs to them! If you touch anything, you will die because of their sins!” <sup>27</sup>So all the people moved away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram came out of their tents with their wives and children and babies, and stood at the entrances of their tents.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>Then Moses/I said, “I was not the one who decided to do all these things that I have done. It was Yahweh who chose me and sent me to do them. And now he will prove that to you. <sup>29</sup>If these men die in a normal way, then it will be clear that Yahweh did not choose me. <sup>30</sup>But if Yahweh does something that has never happened before, if he causes the ground that is under their feet to open up and swallow these men and their families and all their possessions, and they fall into the opening and are buried while they are still alive, then you will know that these men have insulted Yahweh.”</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>As soon as Moses/I said this, the ground split open beneath those men. <sup>32</sup>It swallowed them and their families and all those who were standing there with Korah and all of their possessions. <sup>33</sup>They fell into the opening in the ground while they were still alive, and all their possessions fell into the opening also. They disappeared, and the ground closed back up again. <sup>34</sup>They screamed as they fell, and all the people who were standing nearby heard them scream. The people were terrified and cried out as they ran away, saying, “We do not want the ground to swallow us also!”</p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>And then a fire from Yahweh came down from the sky and burned up the 250 men who were burning the incense!</p><p>
    <sup>36</sup>Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, <sup>37</sup>“Tell Aaron’s son Eleazar to take the pans that had incense in them away from the fire and to scatter the burning coals. The pans that those men were carrying are ◄holy/dedicated to me► because they burned incense to me in them. <sup>38</sup>Those men have now died because of their sin; so Eleazar must take their pans and hammer the metal to make it become very thin. He must make a covering for the altar with that metal. Those pans were used to offer incense to me, so they are ◄holy/dedicated to me►. What happened to those pans will now warn the Israeli people.”</p><p>
    <sup>39</sup>So Eleazar the priest collected the 250 pans for burning incense that had been used by the men who died in the fire. He hammered the pans very thin to make a covering for the altar, as Yahweh told Moses/me should be done. <sup>40</sup>That warned the Israeli people that only those who were descendants of Aaron were permitted to burn incense for an offering to Yahweh. If anyone else did that, the same thing that happened to Korah and those who were with him would happen to them.</p><p>
    <sup>41</sup>But the following morning, all the Israeli people started to complain against Aaron and Moses/me, saying “You have killed many people who belonged to Yahweh!”</p><p>
    <sup>42</sup>When all the people gathered together to protest about what Aaron and Moses/I had done, they looked at the Sacred Tent and saw that the sacred cloud had covered it, and the glory of Yahweh had appeared. <sup>43</sup>Aaron and Moses/I went and stood in front of the Sacred Tent. <sup>44</sup>Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, <sup>45</sup>“Get away from these people, in order that I can get rid of them immediately without injuring you two!” But Aaron and Moses/I prostrated themselves/ourselves on the ground and prayed.</p><p>
    <sup>46</sup>Moses/I said to Aaron, “Quickly take another pan and put in it some burning/hot coals from the altar. Put incense in the pan, and carry it out among the people to atone for the sins of the people. Yahweh is very angry with them, and I know that a ◄severe plague/bad sickness► has already started among them.” <sup>47</sup>So Aaron did what Moses/I told him. He took the burning incense out among the people. The plague had already started to strike the people, but Aaron continued to burn the incense so that God would forgive them for the sins they had committed. <sup>48</sup>He stood between the people who had already died and those who were still alive, and then the plague stopped. <sup>49</sup>But 14,700 people had already died from that plague/sickness, in addition to the people who died with Korah. <sup>50</sup>Then after the plague had ended, Aaron and Moses/I returned to the entrance of the Sacred Tent.</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-17"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-17">17</h3></a>
<p>Aaron’s walking stick budded</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, <sup>2</sup>“Tell the Israeli people to bring to you twelve walking sticks. They should bring one from each of the leaders of the twelve tribes. You should carve each leader’s name on his stick. <sup>3</sup>There must be one stick for the leader of each tribe, so you must carve Aaron’s name on the stick for the tribe of Levi. <sup>4</sup>Put those sticks inside the Sacred Tent, in front of the sacred chest that has in it the tablets on which the Ten Commandments are written. That is the place where I always talk with you. <sup>5</sup>Buds will sprout on the stick of the man whom I have chosen to be the priest. When the people see that, they will stop their constantly complaining about you because they will realize that you are the one whom I have chosen.”</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>So Moses/I told the people what Yahweh had said. Then each of the twelve Israeli leaders, including Aaron, brought his walking stick to Moses/me. <sup>7</sup>Moses/I placed the sticks inside the Sacred Tent in front of the sacred chest.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>The following morning, when he/I went into the tent, he/I saw that Aaron’s stick, which represented the tribe of Levi, had sprouted, it had produced leaves and blossoms, and it had also produced almonds that were ripe! <sup>9</sup>Moses/I brought all the sticks out of the Sacred Tent and showed them to the people. Each of the twelve leaders took back his own stick.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Put Aaron’s stick in front of the sacred chest, and let it stay there permanently. That will be a warning to people who want to rebel against me. Then no more people will die because of complaining against me.” <sup>11</sup>So Moses/I did what Yahweh had commanded.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Then the Israeli people said to Moses/me, “We are going to die! All of us are surely going to die! <sup>13</sup>Everyone who comes close to Yahweh’s Sacred Tent dies. Are the rest of us going to die, also?” [RHQ]</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-18"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-18">18</h3></a>
<p>The duties of the priests and Levites</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh said to Aaron, “You and your sons and the other members of your father’s family are the ones ◄who will be punished/whom I will punish► if anything bad happens to the things inside the Sacred Tent. But only you and your sons will be punished if the priests do something bad. <sup>2</sup>Require that those who belong to your tribe, the tribe of Levi, must assist you and your sons while you perform your work at the Sacred Tent. <sup>3</sup>But while they do that work, they must not go near the sacred items inside the tent or near the altar. If they do that, they will die, and you will die, too! <sup>4</sup>They may assist you in doing all the work to take care of the Sacred Tent, but no one else is permitted to come near the place where you are working.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>“You are the ones who will do the sacred work inside the Sacred Tent and at the altar. If you obey these instructions, I will not become very angry with the Israeli people again. <sup>6</sup>I myself have chosen the descendants of Levi from the other Israelis in order that they may be your special helpers. They are like a gift that I have given you to work at the Sacred Tent. <sup>7</sup>But it is you and your sons, who are the priests, who must perform all the rituals concerning the altar and with what happens inside the Very Holy Place. I am giving to you this work of serving as priests. So anyone else who tries to do that work must be executed.”</p><p>The offerings for the priests and Levites</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Yahweh also said to Aaron, “I myself have appointed you to take care of all the sacred offerings that the Israeli people bring to me. I have given all these sacred offerings to you and to your sons. You and your descendants will get a share of these offerings permanently. <sup>9</sup>The parts of the offerings that are not completely burned on the altar belong to you. Those parts of the sacred offerings, including the offerings of grain, the offerings for sins and for the people to be forgiven for not giving me what they are required to give, are set apart, and are to be given to you and your sons. <sup>10</sup>You must eat those offerings in a sacred place, near the Sacred Tent. You and all of the other males in your clan may eat them, but you must consider those offerings to be holy/dedicated to me.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>“The priests lift up high the sacred offerings while they are standing in front of the altar. All of those offerings that the Israelis offer to me belong to you and your sons and daughters. They will always be your share. All the members of your family who have performed the rituals to cause them to  be acceptable to me are permitted to eat from these offerings.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>“ am also giving to you the first food that people harvest each year and bring to me—the best olive oil and new wine and grain. <sup>13</sup>All of the first crops that people harvest and bring to me belong to you. Anyone in your family who has performed the ritual to become acceptable to me is permitted to eat that food.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>“Everything in Israel that is set apart to belong to me also belongs to you. <sup>15</sup>The firstborn males, both humans and domestic animals, that are offered to me, will be yours. But people must buy back their firstborn sons and the firstborn animals that may not be used for sacrifices. <sup>16</sup>They must buy them back when they are one month old. The price that they must pay for each one is five pieces of silver. They must weigh the silver on the scales that are in the Sacred Tent.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>“But they are not permitted to buy back the firstborn cattle or sheep or goats. They are holy and have been set apart for me. Slaughter them and sprinkle their blood on the altar. Then completely burn the fat of those animals on the altar to be an offering to me. The smell as they burn will be very pleasing to me. <sup>18</sup>The meat from those offerings will be yours, just like the breast and right thigh of animals that are presented to me to maintain fellowship with me as the priest lifts them up high in front of the altar are yours. <sup>19</sup>Anything that the Israeli people present to me as holy/sacred gifts, I am giving to you. They are for you and your sons and daughters to eat. They will always be your share. This is an agreement that I am making with you, an agreement that will ◄last forever/never be changed►. I am also making this agreement with your descendants.”</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>Yahweh also said to Aaron, “You priests will not receive any of the land or the property like the other Israeli people will receive. I am what you will receive.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>“Then the Israeli people bring to me a tenth of all the crops and of their newborn animals, I will give that to you descendants of Levi. That will be your payment for the work you do at the Sacred Tent. <sup>22</sup>The other Israelis must not go near that tent. If they go near it, I will consider that their doing that is a sin, and  they will die for committing that sin. <sup>23</sup>Only the descendants of Levi are permitted to work at the Sacred Tent, and they will be punished if anything bad happens to it. That is a law that will never be changed. You descendants of Levi will not receive any land among the other Israeli people, <sup>24</sup>because I will give you one tenth of all the crops and animals that the Israelis bring to be offerings to me. That is why I said that you will not receive any land like the other Israelis will receive.”</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>Yahweh said to Moses/me, <sup>26</sup>“Tell this to the descendants of Levi: ‘When you receive one tenth of all the crops and animals from the Israeli people, you must give one tenth of all that to me to be a sacred offering. <sup>27</sup>Just like the other Israelis give one tenth of the grain and wine that they produce, <sup>28</sup>you must give to me one tenth of all that you receive from them. That will be your sacred offering to me. You must present it to Aaron. <sup>29</sup>Select the best parts of the things that are given to you to give them to me.’</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>“Also, tell this to the descendants of Levi: ‘When you present those best portions of grain and wine as your offering to me, I will consider that those gifts are as though they came from your own grain fields and vineyards. <sup>31</sup>You descendants of Levi and your families are permitted to eat the rest of that food, and you may eat it wherever you want to, because it is your payment for the work that you do at the Sacred Tent. <sup>32</sup>If you give to the priests the best portions of what you receive, you will not be punished by me for accepting one tenth of the gifts that the people bring to me. But you must consider those gifts to be sacred/holy. If you sin by eating those things in ways that are contrary to these regulations that I have given to you, you will be executed.’&#160;”</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-19"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-19">19</h3></a>
<p>The ritual for removing the guilt of sin</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh said to Aaron and Moses/me, <sup>2</sup>“I am now giving to you another regulation. Tell the Israeli people to bring to you one reddish-brown cow that has no defects. It must be an animal that ◄has never been/no one has ever► used for plowing ground. <sup>3</sup>Give it to Eleazar, the priest. He must take it outside the camp and slaughter it and drain the blood in a basin. <sup>4</sup>He must dip one of his fingers in the blood and sprinkle some of it seven times on the ground near the Sacred Tent. <sup>5</sup>Then, while Eleazar watches, the cow must be burned completely—its hide, its meat, the rest of its blood, and even its dung. <sup>6</sup>Eliezer then must take a stick of cedar wood, a stalk of a plant named hyssop, and some scarlet/red yarn, and throw them into the fire where the cow is burning.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>“Then the priest must wash his clothes and bathe. After doing that, he may return to the camp. But he will be unfit for doing any sacred work until that evening. <sup>8</sup>The man who burns the cow must also wash his clothes and bathe, and he will also be unacceptable to me until that evening.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>“Then someone who has not become unacceptable to me must gather up the ashes of the cow and put them in a ◄sacred place/place that is acceptable to me► outside the camp. The ashes must be kept there for the people of Israel to use when they mix it with water for the ritual to remove the guilt of sin. <sup>10</sup>The man who gathers up the ashes of the cow must also wash his clothes, and he also will be unfit to do any more sacred work until that evening. That is a regulation that will never be changed. It must be obeyed by you Israeli people and by any foreigners who live among you.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>“All those who touch a corpse will be unacceptable to me for seven days. <sup>12</sup>On the third day and on the seventh day after touching a corpse, in order to become acceptable to me again, they must have sprinkled on them some of that water for removing the guilt of their sin. If they do not do that on both of those days, they will continue to be unacceptable to me. <sup>13</sup>All those who touch a corpse, and do not perform in the correct way the ritual to become acceptable to me again, defile Yahweh’s Sacred Tent. They will no longer be permitted to live among the Israeli people. The water to remove the guilt of sin was not sprinkled on them, so they continue to be unacceptable to me.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>“There is another ritual that must be performed when someone dies inside a tent. All those who were inside that tent when that person died or who enter that tent will be unacceptable to me for seven days. <sup>15</sup>Any jars that are inside that tent that are not covered are not permitted to be used. <sup>16</sup>If someone who is out in a field touches the corpse of someone who was murdered, or who died from natural causes, or if someone touches a bone from some human or touches a grave, that person will be unacceptable to me for seven days.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>“For someone like that to become acceptable to me again, some of the ashes from the cow that was burned must be taken and put in a jar. Then some fresh water must be poured over the ashes. <sup>18</sup>Then someone who is still acceptable to me must take a stalk of a plant named hyssop and dip it into the water. Then that person must sprinkle some of the water on the tent where that person died, on the things that are in the tent, and on the people who were in the tent. He must also sprinkle some of that water on any person who touched a human bone or who touched a person who died, or who touched a grave. <sup>19</sup>On the third day and on the seventh day after that, the person who is acceptable to me must sprinkle some of that water on those who have become unacceptable to me. On the seventh day, the people who are performing that ritual to become acceptable to me again must wash their clothes and bathe. If they do that, on that evening they will become acceptable to me again.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>“If those who have become unacceptable to me do not become acceptable to me again by doing this, they will no longer be permitted to live among the Israeli people, because they have defiled my Sacred Tent. They did not sprinkle on themselves the water that removes the guilt of their sins, so they remain unacceptable to me. <sup>21</sup>That is a law for the Israeli people that will never be changed. Those who sprinkle that water on themselves must then wash their clothes. And anyone who touches that water which removes guilt for sins will remain unacceptable to God until that evening.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>“If someone touches a thing or a person that has become unacceptable to me, that person will remain unacceptable to me until that evening.”</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-20"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-20">20</h3></a>
<p>Water flowed from a rock</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>In March/April of the next year, the Israeli people traveled/walked to the Zin Desert and ◄camped/set up their tents► near Kadesh town. While they/we were there, Moses’/my older sister Miriam died and was buried there.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>There was no water for the people to drink there, so they came to Aaron and Moses/me. <sup>3</sup>They complained and said, “We wish that we had died in front of Yahweh’s Sacred Tent when our fellow Israelis died! <sup>4</sup>◄Did you bring us, who are Yahweh’s people, into this desert to die along with our livestock?/You brought us, who are Yahweh’s people, into this desert to die along with our livestock!► [RHQ] <sup>5</sup>Why did you bring us from Egypt to this miserable place [RHQ]? There is no grain, there are no figs, no grapes, and no pomegranates here. And there is no water for us to drink!”</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Aaron and Moses/I turned away from the people and went to the entrance of the Sacred Tent and prostrated themselves/ourselves on the ground. Then Yahweh appeared to them/us with his bright glory, <sup>7</sup>and he said to Moses/me, <sup>8</sup>“You and Aaron must take Aaron’s walking stick with you and gather all the people together. While the people are watching, command that water will flow out of that large rock over there. Water for the people will flow from it; all they and all their livestock will have enough water to drink.”</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>So Moses/I did what Yahweh told him/me to do. He/I took Aaron’s walking stick from the place in the Sacred Tent where it was kept. <sup>10</sup>Then Aaron and he/I summoned all the people to gather at the rock. Then Moses/I shouted to them, “All you rebellious people, listen! Is it necessary for us to give you water from this rock?” <sup>11</sup>Then Moses/I raised his/my hand and instead of speaking to the rock, he/I struck the rock two times with the walking stick. And water gushed/poured out. So all the people and their livestock drank all the water that they wanted.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>But Yahweh said to Aaron and Moses/me, “You did not believe that I could demonstrate my power to the Israeli people and give them water without your striking the rock. So you will not lead them into the land that I am giving to them!”</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Later this place was called Meribah, which means ‘arguing’, because there the Israeli people argued with Yahweh, and there he showed his power to them by giving them water.</p><p>The king of Edom refused to allow the Israelis to travel through his country</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    While the people were at Kadesh town, Moses/I sent messengers to the king of Edom to tell him this:</p><p>“Your relatives, the Israeli people, are sending you this message. You know the many troubles/hardships that have happened to us. <sup>15</sup>You know that our ancestors went down to Egypt. You know that they stayed there for many years. They suffered because the rulers of Egypt caused them to become their slaves and to work very hard.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>“But when they called out to Yahweh, he heard them and sent an angel who brought them out of Egypt. Now we have set up our tents here at Kadesh, a town at the border of your land. <sup>17</sup>Please allow us to travel through your country. We will be careful to not walk through your fields and your vineyards. We will not even drink water from your wells. As we travel, we will stay on the king’s highway, the main road that goes from the south to the north, and we will not leave that road until we have crossed the border of your country in the north.”</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>But the king of Edom refused. He replied, “Stay out of my country! If you try to enter it, I will send my army to attack you!”</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>The Israeli messengers replied, “If we travel through your country, we will stay on the main road. If we and any of our livestock drink any of your water, we will pay for it. We want only to travel through your country. We do not want anything else.”</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>But the king replied, “No! Stay out of our country! We will not allow you to travel through our land!” Then he sent the strongest soldiers in his army to prevent the Israelis from entering his country.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>So, because the king of Edom refused to allow the Israelis to travel through his country, the Israelis turned and traveled a different way.</p><p>Aaron died</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>The Israeli people left Kadesh. They went to Hor Mountain, <sup>23</sup>which is at the border of Edom. While they were there, Yahweh said to Aaron and Moses/me, <sup>24</sup>“It is time for Aaron to die [EUP]. He will not enter the land that I am giving to you Israelis, because the two of you disobeyed me when I told you to speak to the rock to cause the water to flow at Meribah. <sup>25</sup>Now you, Moses, take Aaron and his son Eleazar up on Hor Mountain. <sup>26</sup>There you must remove Aaron’s robes that he wears when he does the work of a priest, and put them on his son, Eleazar. Aaron will die up there.”</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>So Moses/I did what Yahweh commanded. The three of them/us climbed up Hor Mountain, while all the Israeli people watched. <sup>28</sup>At the top of the mountain, Moses/I took off the robes that Aaron wore while he did the work of a priest and put them on Eleazar. Then Aaron died there on the top of the mountain, and Eleazar and Moses/I went back down. <sup>29</sup>When the Israeli people realized that Aaron had died, they all mourned for him for 30 days.</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-21"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-21">21</h3></a>
<p>The Israelis defeated the Canaan people</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>The king of Arad city lived in the area where the Canaan people-group lived, in the desert in the southern part of the land. He heard a report that the Israelis were approaching on the road to Atharim village. So his army attacked the Israelis and captured some of them. <sup>2</sup>Then the Israelis solemnly vowed: “Yahweh, if you will help us to defeat these people, we will completely destroy all their towns.” <sup>3</sup>Yahweh heard what they requested, and he enabled them to defeat the army of the Canaan people-group. The Israeli soldiers killed all the people and destroyed their towns. Ever since that time, that place has been called Hormah which means ‘destruction’.</p><p>The bronze snake</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Then the Israelis left Hor Mountain and traveled on the road towards the Red Sea, in order to go around the land of Edom. But the people became impatient along the way, <sup>5</sup>and they began to grumble/complain against God and against Moses/me. They said, “Why have you brought us out of Egypt to die here in this desert [RHQ]? There is nothing to eat here, and nothing to drink. And we detest this lousy manna food!”</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>So Yahweh sent poisonous snakes among them. Many of the people were bitten by the snakes and died. <sup>7</sup>Then the people came to Moses/me and cried out, saying, “We now know that we have sinned against Yahweh and against you. Pray to Yahweh, asking that he will take away the snakes!” So Moses/I prayed for the people.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Then Yahweh told him/me, “Make a model/image of a poisonous snake, and attach it to the top of a pole. If those who are bitten by the snakes look at that model, they will ◄recover/get well►.” <sup>9</sup>So Moses/I made a snake from bronze and attached it to the top of a pole. Then, when those who had been bitten by a snake looked at the bronze snake, they recovered!</p><p>The Israelis traveled to Moab</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Then the Israelis traveled to Oboth and ◄camped/set up their tents► there. <sup>11</sup>Then they left there, and went to Iye-Abarim, in the desert on the eastern border of Moab. <sup>12</sup>From there they traveled to the valley where the Zered riverbed is, and camped there. <sup>13</sup>Then they traveled to the north side of the Arnon River. That area is in the desert next to the land where the Amor people-group lived. The Arnon River is the boundary between Moab and where the Amor people-group lived. <sup>14</sup>That is why in the book called ‘The Book of the Wars of Yahweh’ it tells about</p><p>“Waheb town in the Suphah area, and the ravines there;</p><p>and the Arnon River</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>and the ravines there,</p><p>which extend as far as Ar village on the border of Moab.”</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>From there, the Israelis traveled to Beer. There was a well there, where Yahweh previously had said to Moses/me, “Gather the people together, and I will give them water.” <sup>17</sup>There the Israelis sang this song:</p><p>“O well, give us water!</p><p>Sing about this well!</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>Sing about this well</p><p>which our leaders dug;</p><p>they dug out the dirt with their royal scepters and their walking sticks.”</p><p>Then the Israelis left that desert and went through Mattanah, <sup>19</sup>Nahaliel, and Bamoth villages. <sup>20</sup>Then they went to the valley in Moab where Pisgah Mountain rises above the desert.</p><p>The Israelis defeated kings Sihon and Og</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>Then the Israelis sent messengers to Sihon, the king of the Amor people-group. This was the message that they/we gave him:</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>“Allow us to travel through your country. We will stay on the king’s highway, the main road that goes from the south to the north, until we have finished traveling through your land. We will not walk through any field or vineyard, or drink water from your wells.”</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>But King Sihon refused. He would not allow them to walk through his land. Instead, he sent his whole army to attack the Israelis in the desert. They attacked the Israelis at Jahaz village. <sup>24</sup>But the Israelis completely defeated them and occupied their land, from the Arnon River in the south to the Jabbok River in the north. They stopped at the border of the land where the Ammon people-group lived, because the Ammon army was defending the border strongly. <sup>25</sup>So the Israelis occupied all the cities and towns where the Amor people-group lived, and some of the Israelis began to live in them. They occupied Heshbon city and the nearby villages. <sup>26</sup>Heshbon was the capital of the country. It was the city where King Sihon ruled. His army had previously defeated the army of the king of Moab, and then his people had begun to live in all of the land of Moab as far as the Arnon River in the south.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>For that reason, one of the poets wrote long ago,</p><p>“Come to Heshbon, the city where King Sihon ruled.</p><p>We want the city to be restored/rebuilt.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>A fire blazed from Heshbon;</p><p>it burned down Ar city in Moab,</p><p>it destroyed everything on the hills along the Arnon River.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>You people of Moab, terrible things have happened to you!</p><p>You people who worship your god Chemosh have been ◄annihilated/wiped out►!</p><p>The men who worshiped [MET] Chemosh have run away and are now refugees,</p><p>and the women who worshiped him have been captured by the army of Sihon, the king of the Amor people-group.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>But we have defeated Sihon and those descendants of Amor,</p><p>all the way from Heshbon in the north to Dibon city in the south.</p><p>We have completely obliterated/destroyed them as far as Nophah and Medeba towns.”</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>So the Israeli people began to live in the land where the Amor people-group lived.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>After Moses/I sent some men to explore the area near Jazer city, Israeli people began to live in all the towns in that region and expelled the Amor people-group who lived there. <sup>33</sup>Then they turned north toward the Bashan region, but King Og of Bashan and all his army attacked them at Edrei town.</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Do not be afraid of Og, because I am going to enable your men to defeat him and his army, and to take possession of all his land. You will do to him what you did to Sihon, the king of the Amor people-group, who ruled in Heshbon.”</p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>And that is what happened. We Israelis defeated Og’s army, and killed King Og and his sons and all his people. Not a person survived! And then we Israelis began to live in their land.</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-22"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-22">22</h3></a>
<p>King Balak summoned Balaam</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Then the Israelis traveled west to the area of Moab that was in the valley of the Jordan River, across the river from Jericho city.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>But King Balak, the son of Zippor, who ruled Moab, found out what the Israelis had done to the Amor people-group. <sup>3</sup>When he saw that the Israelis were very numerous, he and his people became terrified.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>So the king of Moab went to the leaders of the Midian people-group and said to them, “This huge group of Israelis will ◄wipe out/destroy► everything around them, like an ox devours grass!”</p><p>Balak was the king of Moab. <sup>5</sup>He sent messengers to a prophet named Balaam, who was living in his own area, in Pethor town, near the Euphrates River. He sent this message to request that Balaam would come to help him:</p><p>“A huge group of people has arrived here from Egypt. It looks like they are covering the entire land! And they have begun to live close to us. <sup>6</sup>Because they are very powerful/numerous, we are afraid of them. So please come and curse them for me. Then my army may be able to defeat them and expel them from the land where they are now living. I know that good things will happen to the people whom you bless, and disasters will happen to the people whom you curse.”</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    Balak’s messengers, who were leaders of both the Moab and Midian people-groups, took money with them to pay Balaam in order that he would come and curse the Israelis. They went to Balaam and told him what Balak had said.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Balaam said, “Stay here tonight. Tomorrow morning I will tell you whatever Yahweh tells me that I should say to you.”</p><p>So the leaders from Moab stayed there that night. <sup>9</sup>During the night, God appeared to Balaam and asked him, “◄Who are/Tell me about► these men who are staying with you.”</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Balaam replied, “Balak, the king of Moab, sent these men to tell me this: <sup>11</sup>‘A huge group of people has come from Egypt, and they have spread all over this area. Please come immediately to curse them. Then I may be able to defeat them and expel them from this area.’”</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>God replied to Balaam, “Do not go with them! I have blessed those people, so you must not curse them!”</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>The next morning, Balaam got up and told Balak’s men, “Go back home. But go by yourselves, because Yahweh is not allowing me to go with you.”</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>So the men from Moab returned to King Balak and they reported to him, “Balaam refused to come with us.”</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>But Balak sent another group of leaders to Balaam. It was a group that was larger and they were more important than the men in the first group. <sup>16</sup>They went to Balaam and told him this:</p><p>“This is what King Balak says: ‘Please do not allow anything to hinder you from coming here. <sup>17</sup>I will pay you ◄a lot of money/very well► if you come, and I will do anything that you ask me to do. Just come and curse these Israeli people for me!’”</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>But Balaam answered them, “Even if Balak would give me a palace filled with silver and gold, I would not do anything to disobey Yahweh, ◄my God/the God whom I worship►. <sup>19</sup>But stay here one more night, like the other messengers did, and I will find out if Yahweh has anything more to say to me.”</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>That night God appeared to Balaam again and said to him, “These men have come to request that you go back with them, so you may go with them, but do only what I tell you to do!”</p><p>Balaam’s donkey spoke to warn him</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>So the next morning, Balaam put a saddle on his donkey and he departed with two of his servants along with the men from Moab. <sup>22</sup>Even though God had given Balaam permission to go, he was still angry. So he sent one of his angels to Balaam. This angel stood in the road to block Balaam’s path. As Balaam and the two servants were riding on their donkeys, <sup>23</sup>Balaam’s donkey saw the angel. The angel was standing in the road and was holding a sword in his hand, but Balaam did not see him.</p><p>Balaam’s donkey turned off the road into a field. So Balaam struck the donkey and forced it to go back onto the road. <sup>24</sup>Then the angel stood in a place where the road was very narrow, between two vineyards, with walls on each side of the road. <sup>25</sup>When the donkey saw the angel standing there, it walked very close to the wall to try to get past the angel. As a result, it bashed Balaam’s foot against the wall. So Balaam struck the donkey again.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>Then the angel went further along the road and stood at a place that was extremely narrow, with the result that the donkey could not get past at all. <sup>27</sup>This time, when the donkey saw the angel, it lay down on the ground with Balaam sitting on top of it. Balaam became extremely angry, and he struck the donkey again with his walking stick. <sup>28</sup>Then Yahweh enabled the donkey to speak! It said to Balaam, “What bad thing have I done to you that caused you to strike me three times?”</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>Balaam shouted, “I struck you because you have caused me to appear to be foolish! If I had a sword with me, I would kill you!”</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>But the donkey answered, “I am your own donkey [RHQ], the one that you have always ridden! Have I ever done anything like this previously?”</p><p>Balaam said, “No.”</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>Then Yahweh enabled Balaam to see the angel standing on the road, holding a sword in his hand. Balaam realized that it was an angel and prostrated himself on the ground in front of the angel.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>The angel asked him, ‘◄Why did you strike your donkey three times?/ You should certainly not have struck the donkey three times! [RHQ] I have come to block your path because what you are planning to do is wrong. <sup>33</sup>Three times your donkey saw me and turned away from me. If it had not done that, I would certainly have killed you already, but I would have allowed the donkey to live.”</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>Then Balaam said to the angel, “I have sinned. But I did not realize that you were standing there, trying to block my path. So if you do not want me to continue going, I will return home.”</p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>But the angel replied, “I will allow you to go with these men, but you must say only what I tell you to say!”</p><p>So Balaam went on with the leaders whom Balak had sent.</p><p>
    <sup>36</sup>When King Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went to meet him at a Moab town alongside the Arnon River that was at the border of his own land. <sup>37</sup>When he arrived where Balaam was, he said to him, “I sent you [RHQ] a message saying that you should come immediately [RHQ]! Why did you not come immediately? Did you think that I was not able to pay you a lot of money for coming?”</p><p>
    <sup>38</sup>Balaam replied, “I have come here now, but I am not able to say anything that I want to. I will say only the words that God tells me to say [MTY].”</p><p>
    <sup>39</sup>Then Balaam went with Balak to Kiriath-Huzoth town. <sup>40</sup>There Balak killed some cattle and sheep as sacrifices, and offered parts of the meat to Balaam and the leaders who were with him. <sup>41</sup>They slept there, and the next morning Balak took Balaam part way up the mountain to Bamoth-Baal village. From there, they could see some of the Israeli people who were down below.</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-23"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-23">23</h3></a>
<p>Balaam blessed the Israeli people</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Balaam said to King Balak, “Build seven altars for me here. Then kill seven young bulls and seven rams for a sacrifice.” <sup>2</sup>So Balak did that. And then he and Balaam each burned a young bull and a ram as a sacrifice on each altar.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Then Balaam said to Balak, “You stand here close to your burned offerings, and I will go and ask Yahweh if he has something else to tell me. Then I will tell you what he says to me.”</p><p>Then Balaam went by himself to the top of a hill, <sup>4</sup>and God appeared to him there. Balaam said to him, “We have built seven altars, and I have killed and burned a young bull and a ram as a sacrifice to you on each altar.”</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Then Yahweh gave Balaam a message to give to King Balak. Then he said, “Go back and tell him what I told you.”</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>When Balaam returned to Balak, Balak was standing with the leaders from Moab beside the offerings he had burned on the altar. <sup>7</sup>This is the message that Balaam told them:</p><p>“Balak, the King of Moab, summoned me to come here from Syria;</p><p>he brought me here from the hills at the eastern side of Syria.</p><p>He said, ‘Come and curse the descendants of Jacob for me,</p><p>saying that bad things will happen to these Israeli people!’</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>But ◄how can I curse people whom God has not cursed?/I certainly cannot curse people whom God has not cursed!► [RHQ]</p><p>◄How can I condemn people whom Yahweh has not condemned?/I cannot condemn people whom Yahweh has not condemned!► [RHQ]</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>I have seen them from the tops of the rocky peaks.</p><p>I see that they are a group of people who live by themselves;</p><p>they have separated themselves from other nations.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>◄Who can count the descendants of Jacob; they are as numerous as particles of &lt;dust/dirt&gt;?/No one can count the descendants of Jacob; they are as numerous as particles of &lt;dust/dirt&gt;!► [RHQ]</p><p>◄Who can count even a quarter of the Israeli people?/No one can count even a quarter of the Israeli people!► [RHQ]</p><p>I wish/hope that I will die like righteous people die;</p><p>I hope that I will die peacefully like they will die.”</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Then Balak said, “What have you done to me [RHQ]? I brought you here to curse my enemies, but instead you have ◄blessed them/asked Yahweh to bless them►!”</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>But Balaam replied, “I can [RHQ] say only what Yahweh tells me to say. I cannot say anything else.”</p><p>Balaam prophesied about the Israelis again</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Then King Balak told Balaam, “Come with me to another place. There you will see only part of the Israeli people, and you will be able to curse those people for me.” <sup>14</sup>So Balak took Balaam to a field on the top of Pisgah Mountain. There, again he built seven altars and offered a young bull and a ram as a sacrifice on each altar.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>Then Balaam said to the king, “Stand here close to your burned offerings, while I go and talk with Yahweh.”</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>So Balaam did that, and Yahweh appeared to Balaam again and gave him another message. Then he said, “Go back to Balak and tell him that message.”</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>So Balaam returned to where the king and the leaders from Moab were standing, next to the altar where Balak had burned the sacrifices. Balak asked him, “What did Yahweh say?”</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>Then Balaam told him this message:</p><p>“Balak, listen carefully;</p><p>hear what I have to say, you son of Zippor [DOU]!</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>God is not a human being.</p><p>Humans lie, but God never lies.</p><p>He never changes his mind/thoughts, as humans do.</p><p>Whatever he has said that he will do, he does.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>He commanded me to request him to bless the Israelis,</p><p>So he has blessed them, and I cannot change that.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>Yahweh their God is with/helping them;</p><p>they have declared that he is their true king.</p><p>So the descendants of Jacob will not be harmed;</p><p>they will not have any troubles [DOU].</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>God brought them out of Egypt where they were slaves;</p><p>he is as strong as a wild ox.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>When people curse [PRS] the descendants of Jacob, they will not be harmed;</p><p>when people work sorcery on them, it will have no power.</p><p>So now people will say about the descendants of Jacob,</p><p>‘God has done wonderful things for the Israelis!’</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>They are very strong, like lionesses that are ready to attack other animals;</p><p>they stand firm like lions.</p><p>The lions refuse to rest until they have killed and eaten their prey,</p><p>and drunk the blood of the animals they slaughtered.”</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>Then Balak said to Balaam, “If you will not curse them, then I certainly do not want you to bless them!”</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>But Balaam replied, “I told you that I must do only what Yahweh tells me to do!”</p><p>Balaam prophesied about the Israelis a third time</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>Then King Balak said to Balaam, “Come with me; I will take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God to allow you to curse them from that place.” <sup>28</sup>So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor Mountain where they could look down and see the Israelis in the desert.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>Balaam again told Balak, “Build me seven altars again and kill seven young bulls and seven rams for a sacrifice.” <sup>30</sup>So Balak did what Balaam told him to do. He burned a young bull and a ram on each altar as sacrifices.</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-24"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-24">24</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>Balaam now realized that Yahweh wanted to bless the Israeli people, not curse them. So he did not use magic/divination like a shaman would do to find out what Yahweh wanted, as he often did. Instead, he turned toward the desert. <sup>2</sup>He saw the Israeli people camped there in their tents, with each tribe gathered in its own group. Then the Spirit of God took control of him, <sup>3</sup>and enabled him to give this prophetic message to Balak:</p><p>“I, Balaam, the son of Beor, am giving this prophecy;</p><p>I am speaking as a man who sees what will happen in the future clearly speaks.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>I hear this message from God;</p><p>I see a vision from him who is all-powerful.</p><p>My eyes are open as I prostrate myself in front of him.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>You descendants of Jacob, your tents are very beautiful;</p><p>they are truly lovely!</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Your tents are spread out in front of me like groves of palm trees in valleys,</p><p>like gardens alongside a river.</p><p>They are like strong aloe trees/plants that Yahweh has planted,</p><p>like strong cedar trees that grow along the rivers.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Your water buckets will always be full;</p><p>the seeds that you plant will always have plenty of water to make them grow.</p><p>The Israelis’ king will be greater than King Agag;</p><p>the kingdom that he rules will be honored.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>God brought the Israelis out of Egypt,</p><p>
    leading them along with his great power [MTY] like a wild ox has.</p><p>He devastates all the nations that oppose him;</p><p>he breaks all those people’s bones into pieces,</p><p>and shoots them with his arrows.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>The Israelis are like lions that crouch and lie down, ready to pounce on their prey [SIM].</p><p>They are like lionesses that are resting, but ready to attack;</p><p>no one [RHQ] would dare to arouse them!</p><p>
    God will bless everyone who blesses you Israelis,</p><p>and he will curse everyone who curses you.”</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Then King Balak was extremely angry with Balaam. He showed with his hands that he was very angry, and he shouted at Balaam, “I summoned you here to curse my enemies! Instead, you have ◄blessed/asked God to bless► them three times! <sup>11</sup>So now, get out of here! Go back home! I said that I would pay you a lot of money if you cursed them, but Yahweh has prevented you from getting any pay!”</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Balaam said to Balak, “Do you not remember what [RHQ] I told the messengers that you sent to me? I said, <sup>13</sup>‘Even if Balak would give me a palace filled with silver and gold, I would not disobey Yahweh. I cannot do anything bad or anything that is good that he does not approve of.’ And I told you that I could say only what Yahweh says to me. <sup>14</sup>So yes, I will return to my people, but first, allow me to tell you what will happen to you Moab people in the future.”</p><p>Balaam prophesied a fourth time</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>So Balaam said this to Balak:</p><p>“I, Balaam, son of Beor, am again giving a prophecy,</p><p>speaking as a man who sees what will happen in the future clearly speaks.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>I hear a message from God;</p><p>I know things that God, who lives in heaven, has revealed to me.</p><p>I see a vision from him who is all-powerful.</p><p>My eyes are open as I prostrate myself in front of him.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>The things that I see in the vision are not going to happen now;</p><p>I see things that God will cause to happen in the future.</p><p>A man who is a descendant of Jacob will appear like a star [MET];</p><p>a king who holds a scepter will be one of the Israeli people.</p><p>He will crush the heads of you people of Moab;</p><p>he will wipe out the descendants of Seth.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>The Israelis will occupy Edom,</p><p>and they will conquer their enemies who live near Seir Mountain.</p><p>The Israeli people will be victorious/strong.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>A ruler who is a descendant of Jacob will come;</p><p>he will get rid of the people who still live in the city where Balaam first met Balak.”</p><p>Balaam’s final prophecies</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>Then Balaam looked out over where the Amalek people-group lived, and he prophesied this:</p><p>“The Amalek people-group were the greatest nation,</p><p>but they will be wiped out.”</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>Then he looked out over the area where the Ken people-group lived, and he prophesied this:</p><p>“You think that the place where you live is secure/safe</p><p>like a nest that is made in the cliffs [MET],</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>but you will be wiped out</p><p>when the army of Assyria conquers you.”</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>Balaam ended his prophecies by saying,</p><p>“Also, ◄who can &lt;survive/escape&gt; when God does all these things?/no one will be able to &lt;survive/escape&gt; when God does all these things!► [RHQ]</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>Ships will come from Cyprus Island,</p><p>and the men in those ships will defeat the armies of Assyria and Eber.</p><p>But God will get rid of those men, too.”</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>Then Balaam and Balak returned to their homes.</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-25"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-25">25</h3></a>
<p>The Israelis worshiped Baal</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>While the Israelis were camped at a place called Acacia Grove, some of the men caused themselves to become unacceptable to God by having sex with some of the women of the Moab people-group who lived in that area. <sup>2</sup>Then those women invited the men to come when the sacrifices were being offered to their gods. The Israeli men accepted. They went to the feasts with the women and worshiped the gods of the Moab people-group. <sup>3</sup>By doing that, those Israeli people joined the women in worshiping the god Baal add who the Moab people-group thought lived on Peor Mountain. That caused Yahweh to become very angry with his people.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Yahweh said this to Moses/me: “Seize all the leaders of those men who are doing this and execute them while I am watching. Do that in the daytime. After you do that, I will no longer be angry with the Israeli people.”</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>So Moses/I said to the other Israeli leaders, “Each of you must execute your men who have joined others in worshiping Baal.”</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    But later, while Moses/I and many [HYP] other people were crying at the entrance of the Sacred Tent, while they/we were watching, one of the Israeli men brought a woman from the Midian people-group into his tent and started to have sex with her. <sup>7</sup>When Phinehas, who was the grandson of Aaron, saw that, he grabbed a spear <sup>8</sup>and rushed into the man’s tent. He thrust the spear completely through the man’s body and into the woman’s belly and killed both of them. When he did that, the ◄plague/serious illness► that had started to strike the Israelis stopped. <sup>9</sup>But 24,000 people had already died from that plague.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, <sup>11</sup>“Phinehas has caused me to stop being angry with the Israeli people, by being as eager as I am to stop this sinful behavior. I was ready to get rid of all the Israeli people because I was extremely angry, but Phinehas has prevented me from doing that. <sup>12</sup>Now tell him that I am making a special peace agreement with him. <sup>13</sup>In this agreement, I am promising to give to him and to his descendants the right/authority to be priests. I am doing this because he showed that he was very eager to honor me, his God, by stopping this sinful behavior. He has caused the Israeli people to become acceptable to me again by causing them to be forgiven for their sin.”</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>The Israeli man who was killed with the woman of the Moab people-group was named Zimri. He was the son of Salu, who was the leader of a family from the tribe of Simeon. <sup>15</sup>The woman’s name was Cozbi. She was the daughter of Zur, who was the leader of one of the clans of the Midian people-group.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, <sup>17</sup>“Take your men and attack the Midian people-group and kill them. <sup>18</sup>They have become your enemies, because they tricked you Israeli people and induced/persuaded many of you to worship Baal, and because one of your men had sex with Cozbi, who was the daughter of a leader of the Midian people-group. She was killed at the time the plague started because the people sinned at Peor Mountain.”</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-26"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-26">26</h3></a>
<p>The people were counted again</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>After the plague ended, Yahweh said to Eleazar and Moses/me, <sup>2</sup>“Count all the people of Israel again. Write down the names of all the men who are at least 20 years old who are able to fight in battles, along with their family names.” <sup>3</sup>So while the Israelis were on the plains where the Moab people-group lived, Eleazar and Moses/I told this to the Israeli leaders: <sup>4</sup>“Write down the names of all the Israeli men who are at least 20 years old, as Yahweh has commanded us.”</p><p>
    So they did that, and this is a record of all the descendants of Jacob who came out of Egypt who were still alive.</p><p>
    <sup>5-7</sup>
    They counted 43,730 men from the tribe of Reuben, Jacob’s oldest son. They were in clans descended from Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. <sup>8</sup>Pallu’s son was Eliab <sup>9</sup>and his grandsons were Nemuel, Dathan and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram were the leaders who joined with Korah to conspire against Aaron and Moses/me and rebelled against Yahweh.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>But the earth opened up and swallowed them and Korah. Yahweh also sent a fire that burned up 250 men who supported those three men. That was a warning to all the Israeli people that they should respect and obey the leaders whom Yahweh had appointed. <sup>11</sup>But the descendants of Korah did not die on that day.</p><p>
    <sup>12-14</sup>The Israeli leaders counted 22,200 men from the tribe of Simeon. They were in clans descended from Nemuel, Jamin, Jakin, Zerah, and Shaul.</p><p>
    <sup>15-18</sup>They counted 40,500 men from the tribe of Gad. They were in clans descended from Zephon, Haggi, Shuni, Ozni, Eri, Arod, and Areli.</p><p>
    <sup>19-22</sup>They counted 76,500 men from the tribe of Judah. They were in clans descended from Shelah, Perez, Zerah, Hezron, and Hamul. Judah’s other two sons, Er and Onan, died in Canaan without having had any children.</p><p>
    <sup>23-25</sup>They counted 64,300 men from the tribe of Issachar. They were in clans descended from Tola, Puvah, Jashub, and Shimron.</p><p>
    <sup>26-27</sup>They counted 60,500 men from the tribe of Zebulun. They were in clans descended from Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.</p><p>
    <sup>28-34</sup>They counted 52,700 men from the tribe of Manasseh, who was one of the sons of Joseph. They were in clans descended from Machir, from his son Gilead, and from his six grandsons—Jezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Shemida, and Hepher. Hepher’s son Zelophehad did not have any sons, but he had five daughters—Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.</p><p>
    <sup>35-37</sup>They counted 32,500 men from the tribe of Ephraim, who was Joseph’s other son. They were in clans descended from Shuthelah, Becher, Tahan, and Shuthelah’s son Eran.</p><p>
    <sup>38-41</sup>They counted 45,600 men from the tribe of Benjamin. They were in clans descended from Bela, Ashbel, Ahiram, Shephupham, and Hupham, and from Bela’s two sons—Ard and Naaman.</p><p>
    <sup>42-43</sup>They counted 64,400 men from the tribe of Dan. They were in one clan descended from Shuham.</p><p>
    <sup>44-47</sup>They counted 53,400 men from the tribe of Asher. They were in clans descended from Imnah, Ishvi, and Beriah, and from Beriah’s two sons—Heber and Malkiel. Asher also had a daughter named Serah.</p><p>
    <sup>48-50</sup>They counted 45,400 men from the tribe of Naphtali. They were in clans descended from Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.</p><p>
    <sup>51</sup>The total of the Israeli men whom the leaders counted was 601,730.</p><p>
    <sup>52</sup>Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, <sup>53</sup>“Divide Canaan land among the tribes. Distribute the land according the number of people in each tribe that are on your lists. <sup>54-56</sup>Decide by ◄casting lots/throwing stones which are marked► to determine which group will get which area, but give the largest areas to the groups with the most people.”</p><p>
    <sup>57</sup>The leaders also counted the male descendants of Levi. They were in clans descended from Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. <sup>58</sup>These also included people from the clans of Libni, Hebron, Mahli, Mushi, and Korah. All of them were descendants of Levi. Kohath was the ancestor of Amram, <sup>59</sup>whose wife was Jochebed. She also was a descendant of Levi, but she was born in Egypt. She and Amram had two sons, Aaron and Moses/me, and their/our older sister Miriam. <sup>60</sup>Aaron’s sons were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. <sup>61</sup>But Nadab and Abihu died when they burned incense for a sacrifice to Yahweh in a way that disobeyed what Yahweh had commanded.</p><p>
    <sup>62</sup>The leaders counted 23,000 men from the descendants of Levi who were at least one month old. But these men were not counted when the rest of the Israeli people were counted, because they were not given any land.</p><p>
    <sup>63</sup>Those were the men whom Eleazar and Moses/I said should be counted. They counted the Israeli people on the plains where the Moab people-group lived, on the east side of the Jordan River, across from Jericho city. <sup>64</sup>None of the men whom they counted were on the lists that were made by Aaron and Moses/me when the Israelis were in the Sinai Desert, <sup>65</sup>because Yahweh had said about them, “They will all die in this desert,” and that is what happened. The only ones who were still alive were Jephunneh’s son Caleb and Nun’s son Joshua.</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-27"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-27">27</h3></a>
<p>The request of the daughters of Zelophehad</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>One day the five daughters of Zelophehad came to Moses/me. They were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. <sup>2</sup>They came to the entrance of the Sacred Tent and stood in front of Eleazar, Moses/me, the tribal leaders, and many [EUP] other Israeli people. <sup>3</sup>They said, “Our father died during the time that we were in the desert, and he did not have any sons. But he was not among those who supported Korah, who rebelled against Yahweh. He died just because he was a sinner like everyone else. <sup>4</sup>◄Why should the name of his clan disappear with the result that we do not receive any land only because our father had no sons?/It is not right that the name of his clan disappear with the result that we do not receive any land only because our father had no sons.► [RHQ] So give us some land like our relatives will be getting!”</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>So Moses/I asked Yahweh what to do about their request. <sup>6</sup>And Yahweh replied, <sup>7</sup>“What the daughters of Zelophehad are requesting is right. You must give them some land, just as you are giving to their father’s relatives. Give to each of them some of the land that would have been given to their brothers if they had any.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>“Also tell this to the Israeli people: ‘If a man who has no sons dies, give the things that his sons would have inherited to his daughters. <sup>9</sup>If the man has no sons or daughters, give to his brothers the things that his sons and daughters would have inherited. <sup>10</sup>If the man had no brothers, give to his father’s brothers the things that his sons or daughters or brothers would have inherited. <sup>11</sup>If the man’s father has no brothers, give to his closest relative the things that the others would have inherited.’ That will be a rule for the Israeli people, because I am giving this as a command to you, Moses, to tell them.”</p><p>Joshua was chosen to be the Israelis’ new leader</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>One day, Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Climb to the top of the Abarim Mountains east of the Jordan River. Then look out over the land that I am giving to the Israeli people. <sup>13</sup>After you have seen it, you will die [EUP] just like your older brother Aaron did. <sup>14</sup>The reason that you will die and not enter that land is that you both disobeyed my instructions/commands in the Zin Desert. When the Israeli people rebelled against me there at Meribah, near Kadesh, I told you to speak to the rock to cause water to flow out of it. But because you struck the rock instead of speaking to it, you did not show the people my holy power.”</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>Then Moses/I said this to Yahweh: <sup>16</sup>“Yahweh, you are the God who directs the spirits of all people. So please appoint a new leader for the Israeli people. <sup>17</sup>Appoint someone who will lead your people when they go to fight a battle, so that they will not just wander around like sheep that do not have a shepherd.” [SIM]</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>Yahweh replied, “Get Joshua, the son of Nun, who has my Spirit within him. Lay your hands on him to appoint him. <sup>19</sup>Cause him to stand in front of Eleazar the priest, as all the people are watching, and commission/appoint him to be the new leader of the Israeli people. <sup>20</sup>Give to him some of the authority that you now have, in order that all the Israeli people will know that they must obey him. <sup>21</sup>When you all need me to guide you, Joshua will stand in front of Eleazar. Then by ◄casting lots/throwing marked stones on the ground► Eleazar will find out what they should do.”</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>So Moses/I did what Yahweh commanded. He/I presented Joshua to Eleazar and to all the Israeli people. <sup>23</sup>Moses/I laid his/my hands on him and commissioned/appointed him to do the work that Yahweh told Moses/me to tell him to do.</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-28"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-28">28</h3></a>
<p>The daily offerings</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh said this to Moses/me: <sup>2</sup>“Tell this to the Israeli people: Bring to me the offerings that will be burned on the altar. When they are burned, the smell will be very pleasing to me. And tell them that they must bring them at the proper/right time. <sup>3</sup>Tell them that what they must bring to me each day are two male lambs that are one-year-old. They must have no defects. They must be completely burned on the altar. <sup>4</sup>They should bring one in the morning and the other early in the evening. <sup>5</sup>They must also bring an offering of grain, consisting of two quarts/liters of finely-ground flour, mixed with a quart of olive oil. <sup>6</sup>That is the offering that they must bring every day. They started to bring those offerings while you were at Sinai Mountain. When those offerings are burned on the altar, the smell will be very pleasing to me. <sup>7</sup>When they burn each lamb, they must also pour on the sacred altar one quart/liter of wine. <sup>8</sup>In the evening, when they offer the second lamb, they must also bring the same offerings of grain and wine as they burned in the morning. When they are burned, the smell will also be very pleasing to me.”</p><p>The offerings on the Sabbath</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>“On each ◄Sabbath/rest day►, you must bring two male lambs that have no defects. Also bring a grain offering of four quarts/liters of finely-ground flour mixed with olive oil and a wine offering of four quarts/liters of wine. <sup>10</sup>Those are the offerings that are to be burned on the altar each ◄Sabbath/rest day►. Those are in addition to the offerings of two lambs and wine that you must bring each day.”</p><p>The monthly offerings</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>“On the first day of each month, you must bring to me an offering of two young bulls, one male sheep, and seven male lambs that are one-year-old. All of these must be without defects. They must all be burned completely on the altar. <sup>12</sup>Also bring with each bull an offering of six quarts/liters of finely-ground flour mixed with olive oil. With each male sheep make an offering of four quarts of finely-ground flour mixed with olive oil. <sup>13</sup>Also bring an offering of two quarts/liters of finely-ground flour mixed with olive oil with each lamb. When all of these are burned on the altar, the smell will be very pleasing to me. <sup>14</sup>With each bull, also bring two quarts/liters of wine. With each male sheep, bring ◄1-1/3 quarts/1.2 liters► of wine. With each lamb, bring one quart/liter of wine. These offerings must be brought on the first day of each month and burned completely on the altar. <sup>15</sup>In addition to these offerings that you burn, you must bring to me one goat for an offering to enable me to forgive you for the sins you have committed.”</p><p>The sacrifices during the Festivals of Passover and Unleavened Bread</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>“The Passover Festival must be celebrated to honor me each year on the fourteenth day of the first month of each year. <sup>17</sup>The Festival of Unleavened Bread will start on the next day.

    <sup>2</sup>When the offerings on the altar on that day are being completely burned, the smell will be very pleasing to me.

    <sup>39</sup>“At your festivals, these are the offerings that you must bring to me: The offerings that will be completely burned on the altar, the offerings of grain and wine, and the offerings to maintain fellowship with me. Those are in addition to the offerings that you give to me because you promised to do something, and other special offerings that you want to give to me.”</p><p>
    <sup>40</sup>Then Moses/I told to the Israeli people all the things that Yahweh had commanded him/me.</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-30"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-30">30</h3></a>
<p>Rules about special promises to Yahweh</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Moses/I spoke with the leaders of the Israeli tribes. He/I told them these commands that Yahweh had given to him/me:</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>“If a man solemnly promises Yahweh that he will do something, he must do what he promised.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>“If a young woman who is still living with her parents solemnly promises to Yahweh to do something, <sup>4</sup>and if her father hears about what she promised, and if he does not object, she must do what she promised [DOU]. <sup>5</sup>But if her father hears about what she promised and does not allow her to do that, then she does not need to do what she promised. Yahweh will forgive her for not doing what she promised.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>“If a woman promises Yahweh that she will do something, but then she gets married, <sup>7</sup>if her husband hears about what she promised to do, and he does not object, she must do what she promised [DOU]. <sup>8</sup>But if her husband hears about it and does not allow her to do that, she does not need to do what she promised, and Yahweh will forgive her for not doing what she promised.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>“If a widow or a woman who has been divorced makes a promise, she must do what she promised.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>“If a woman who is married promises [DOU] to do something, <sup>11</sup>and if her husband hears about it but does not object, she must do what she promised. <sup>12</sup>But if he hears about it and does not allow her to do that, she does not need to do what she promised, and Yahweh will forgive her for not doing it. <sup>13</sup>A woman’s husband may require her to do what she has promised, or he may not allow her to do what she has promised. <sup>14</sup>If he does not object for several days after he hears about it, she must do what she promised. <sup>15</sup>But if he waits a long time after she has promised to do something and then he tells her that he will not permit her to do it, if she does not do what she promised, she will not be punished; her husband is the one whom Yahweh will punish.”</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>Those are the rules that Yahweh gave to Moses/me for husbands and wives, and for young women who are still living with their parents.</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-31"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-31">31</h3></a>
<p>The Israelis attacked the Midian people-group</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh spoke to Moses/me and said, <sup>2</sup>“Before you die, tell the Israeli people that they should ◄pay back/get revenge on► the Midian people-group for what they did to you.”</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>So Moses/I said to the people, “Get some men prepared for battle. Yahweh will enable them to ◄pay back/get revenge on► the Midian people-group for what they did to us. <sup>4</sup>Select 1,000 men from each tribe to fight.” <sup>5</sup>So 12,000 men prepared for fighting in the battle, 1,000 from each tribe. <sup>6</sup>When Moses/I sent them to the battle, Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, went with them. He took with him some of the things from the Sacred Tent and the trumpets that would be blown to give the signal to start the battle.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>The Israeli men fought the soldiers from the Midian people-group, as Yahweh had told Moses/me to tell them to do, and they killed every man from the Midian people-group. <sup>8</sup>Among those whom they killed were the five kings of the Midian people-group—Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba. They also killed with a sword Balaam, the son of Beor. <sup>9</sup>They captured all the women and children of the Midian people-group and took away their cattle, their flocks of sheep, and herds of goats, and all their other possessions. <sup>10</sup>Then they burned down all the houses in the towns and villages where the people of the Midian people-group lived, <sup>11</sup>but they took home with them all the women and children and animals and possessions. <sup>12</sup>They brought all these to Eliezer and Moses/me, and to the rest of the Israeli people who were at their/our camp on the plains where the Moab people-group lived, near the Jordan River, across from Jericho. <sup>13</sup>Eleazar and all the leaders of the people and Moses/I went outside the camp to greet/meet with them.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>But Moses/I was angry with some of the men who had returned from the battle. He/I was angry with the army officers and the men who were commanders of 1,000 men and those who were commanders of 100 men. <sup>15</sup>He/I asked them, “Why did you allow the women to live [RHQ]? <sup>16</sup>They are the ones who did what Balaam suggested and urged/persuaded our people to worship Baal instead of Yahweh. As a result, Yahweh caused a plague to strike his people while they were at Peor. <sup>17</sup>So, now you must kill all the boys of the Midian people-group, and also kill all the women who have had sex [EUP] with any man. <sup>18</sup>Spare only the girls who are virgins [EUP]. You can keep them to be your wives or your slaves.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>All of you who have killed someone or touched the corpse of someone who was killed in the battle must stay outside the camp for seven days. On the third day and on the seventh day, you must perform the ritual to cause you and those whom you have captured to become acceptable to God again. <sup>20</sup>You must also wash your clothes and anything that you took to the battle that is made of leather or goat’s hair or wood.”</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>Then Eleazar said to the soldiers who had returned from the battle, “This is what Yahweh has instructed Moses: <sup>22</sup>You must put into a fire any gold or silver or bronze or iron or tin or lead things that you brought back from the battle. <sup>23</sup>Put everything that will not burn into the fire, and then they will be acceptable for you to use. But also sprinkle those things with the water that causes things and people to become acceptable to God. The things that would burn if you put them in a fire, sprinkle them with that water. <sup>24</sup>On the seventh day, wash your clothes, and then you will become acceptable to God again. After you do that, you may return to the camp.”</p><p>Dividing the captured goods</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>Yahweh also said to Moses/me, <sup>26</sup>“Tell Eleazar and the leaders of the family groups that they must write down a list of all the goods, the women, and the animals that were captured in the battle. <sup>27</sup>Then they must divide all those things, half given to the men who fought in the battle and the other half given to the rest of the people. <sup>28</sup>From the men who fought in the battle, take one from every 500 people and from every 500 cattle and donkeys and sheep, to be a tax for me. <sup>29</sup>Take these things to Eleazar to ◄be my share/belong to me►. <sup>30</sup>And from the half that belongs to the ordinary people, take one item from every 50. That includes people, cattle, donkeys, sheep, goats, and other animals. Give those things to the descendants of Levi who take care of my Sacred Tent.” <sup>31</sup>So Eleazar and Moses/I did what Yahweh commanded.</p><p>
    <sup>32-35</sup>There were 675,000 sheep, 72,000 cattle, 61,000 donkeys, and 32,000 virgins that they had captured from the Midian people-group.</p><p>
    <sup>36</sup>The men who fought in the battle took 337,000 sheep from the battle, <sup>37</sup>and they gave 675 of them to Yahweh. <sup>38</sup>They took 36,000 cattle and gave 72 of them to Yahweh. <sup>39</sup>They took 30,500 donkeys, and they gave 61 of them to Yahweh. <sup>40</sup>They took 16,000 virgins, and they dedicated 32 of them to Yahweh.</p><p>
    <sup>41</sup>Moses/I gave to Eleazar all the animals that had been given to Yahweh, as Yahweh had commanded.</p><p>
    <sup>42-46</sup>Moses/I separated what those who had fought in the battle received from what the other people received. The people had taken 337,500 sheep, 36,000 cattle, 30,500 donkeys, and 16,000 virgins, <sup>47</sup>From what the people received, Moses/I took one from every 50 items and dedicated them to Yahweh. That included animals and people. As Yahweh commanded, he/I gave them all to the descendants of Levi who took care of the Sacred Tent.</p><p>
    <sup>48</sup>Then the army officers and those who commanded 1,000 men and those who commanded 100 men came to Moses/me. <sup>49</sup>They said, “We, who are your servants, have counted the soldiers whom we command, and we found that none of them ◄is missing/has been killed►. <sup>50</sup>So to thank Yahweh for that, we have brought to him a gift of the gold items that we found after the battle: Gold arm bands and bracelets and rings and earrings and necklaces. This will enable us to be forgiven for our sins.”</p><p>
    <sup>51</sup>So Eleazar and Moses/I accepted the gold items that they brought. <sup>52</sup>The total of it weighed about ◄420 pounds/190 kg.►. <sup>53</sup>Each soldier had taken these things for himself. <sup>54</sup>Eleazar and Moses/I accepted these gold items from these commanders and put them in the Sacred Tent to remind the Israeli people about how Yahweh had helped them defeat the Midian people-group.</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-32"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-32">32</h3></a>
<p>The land east of the Jordan River</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>The people of the tribes of Reuben and Gad had much livestock. They saw that the land near Jazer city and the Gilead region east of the Jordan River had good grass for the animals to graze on. <sup>2</sup>So their leaders came to Eleazar and the other leaders of the people and Moses/me. They said, <sup>3</sup>“We have a great amount of livestock. <sup>4</sup>Yahweh has enabled us Israelis to capture some land that is very good for animals to graze on—the land near Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon towns. <sup>5</sup>If it pleases you, we would like this land to be ours, instead of land on the other side of the Jordan River.”</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Moses/I replied to the leaders of the tribes of Gad and Reuben, “It is not right for [RHQ] your fellow Israelis to go to fight in wars and you stay here! <sup>7</sup>If you do that, you will cause the other Israelis to be discouraged, with the result that they will not cross the Jordan River to the land that Yahweh is giving to them [RHQ]. <sup>8</sup>Your ancestors did the same kind of thing. I sent them from Kadesh-Barnea to see what the land of Canaan was like. <sup>9</sup>They went as far as Eshcol Valley, but when they saw the huge people in the land, they returned and caused the Israeli people to be discouraged, saying ‘We should not try to enter the land that Yahweh said that he is giving to us.’ <sup>10</sup>So Yahweh became very angry with them, and he solemnly declared this: <sup>11-12</sup>‘From all the people who came out of Egypt, the only ones who are at least 20 years old who will see the land that I promised to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, are Jephunneh’s son Caleb and Nun’s son Joshua, because they trusted me completely. None of the other people who came out of Egypt will even see that land, because they have not completely believed in my power.’ <sup>13</sup>So Yahweh was angry with the Israeli people, and as a result he has caused us to wander in this desert for 40 years. Finally, all the people who had sinned against Yahweh by refusing to trust him died, one by one. <sup>14</sup>And you are acting like your ancestors did! You sinful Israeli people are going to cause Yahweh to be more angry with you than he was with our ancestors <sup>15</sup>If you stop trusting him, he will cause you and all your fellow Israelis to stay longer in the desert, and he will get rid of all of you!”</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>Then the leaders of the tribes of Reuben and Gad said to Moses/me, “First we will build pens for our animals and build cities for our families here. <sup>17</sup>Then our families will live in strong cities with walls around them, and they will be safe from the people who live in this land. Then we will get ready to fight battles. We will help the other Israelis to get land on the other side of the river. <sup>18</sup>We will not return to our homes until every Israeli has received some land. <sup>19</sup>We will not take any land on the west side of the Jordan River; our land will be here on the east side.”</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>So Moses/I told them, “Okay, I will tell you what you all must do. You must get ready to fight battles for Yahweh. <sup>21</sup>You all must cross the Jordan River carrying your weapons. <sup>22</sup>After Yahweh helps us to take that land from the people who live there, you will be permitted to return to your homes. You will have done what you have promised Yahweh and the Israeli people that you would do, and you may keep this land to be your own, given to you by Yahweh.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>“But if you do not do these things, you will be sinning against Yahweh, and he will punish you for that sin. <sup>24</sup>Now you can build cities for your families and pens for your animals, but after doing that, you must do what you have promised.”</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>The leaders of the tribes of Gad and Reuben replied, “We will do what you have asked us to do [MTY], because you are our leader. <sup>26</sup>Our wives and children and our cattle and sheep and goats will stay here in the cities in the Gilead area, <sup>27</sup>but we will prepare to go to battle. We will take our weapons and go across the Jordan River and fight for Yahweh, just as you, our leader, have said.”</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>So Moses/I gave instructions about them to Eleazar, Joshua, and the leaders of the Israeli tribes. <sup>29</sup>Moses/I said to them, “If the men from the tribes of Gad and Reuben prepare for battle and cross the Jordan River with you, in order to do what Yahweh desires and help you to take that land, give them the Gilead area to belong to them. <sup>30</sup>But if they do not take their weapons and go with you prepared to fight, they will not receive this land. They will need to accept some land in Canaan, like the rest of you will do.”</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>The leaders of the tribes of Gad and Reuben replied, “We will do what you have said and what Yahweh has said. <sup>32</sup>We will cross the river into Canaan land, and we will do what Yahweh desires and be prepared for battle. But our land will be here on the east side of the Jordan River.”</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>So Moses/I agreed to give that land to the tribes of Gad and Reuben and to half of the tribe of Joseph’s son Manasseh. That land was previously the land where Sihon, the king of the Amor people-group, ruled, and the land where Og, the king of Bashan region, ruled, including its cities and surrounding land.</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>The people of the tribe of Gad rebuilt Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, <sup>35</sup>Atroth-Shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah, <sup>36</sup>Beth-Nimrah, and Beth-Haran cities. Those were cities with strong walls around them. And they also built pens for their sheep.</p><p>
    <sup>37</sup>The people of the tribe of Reuben rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim, <sup>38</sup>Nebo, Baal-Meon, and Sibmah cities. When they rebuilt Nebo and Baal-Meon, they gave new names to those cities.</p><p>
    <sup>39</sup>The descendants of Manasseh’s son Makir went to the Gilead region and compelled the people of the Amor people-group to leave that area. <sup>40</sup>So Moses/I gave Gilead to the family of Makir, and they started to live there. <sup>41</sup>Jair, who was also a descendant of Manasseh, went and captured the small towns in that region, and he named them the Towns of Jair. <sup>42</sup>A man named Nobah went and captured Kenath city and the nearby towns, and then he put his own name to be the new name of that area.</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-33"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-33">33</h3></a>
<p>The Israelis’ journey from Egypt to Moab</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Here is a list of the places where the/we Israelis went as Aaron and Moses/I led them/us after they/we left Egypt. <sup>2</sup>Yahweh commanded Moses/me to write down the names of the places where they/we went.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>On the fifteenth day of the first month of the year, the day after we celebrated the ◄Passover/the time when Yahweh killed all the firstborn sons of the people of Egypt►, they/we left Rameses city in Egypt and marched boldly while the Egyptian army was coming behind them/us. <sup>4</sup>As they/we left, the people of Egypt were still burying the bodies of their firstborn sons. By killing them, Yahweh showed that the gods that the people of Egypt worshiped were false gods.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>After leaving Rameses, they/we first went to Succoth and set up their/our tents there.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Then they/we left Succoth and went to Etham, at the edge of the desert, and set up their/our tents there.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Then they/we left Etham and returned to Pi-Hahiroth, to the east of Baal-Zephon, and set up their/our tents near Migdol.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Then they/we left Pi-Hahiroth and walked through the Red Sea into the Etham Desert, and set their/our tents at Marah.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Then they/we left Marah and went to Elim. There were twelve springs and 70 palm trees there. They/We set up our tents there.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Then they/we left Elim and went to the area near the Red Sea and set up their/our tents there.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Then they/we left the Red Sea area and went to the area near the Sin Desert and set up their/our tents there.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Then they/we left the Sin Desert and went to Dophkah and set up their/our tents there.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Then they/we left Dophkah and went to Alush and set up their/our tents there.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>Then they/we left Alush and went and set up their/our tents at Rephidim, where they/we had no water to drink.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>Then they/we left Rephidim and went to the Sinai Desert and set up their/our tents there.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>Then they/we left the Sinai Desert and went to Kibroth-Hattaavah and set up their/our tents there.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Then they/we left Kibroth-Hattaavah and went to Hazeroth and set up their/our tents there.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>Then they/we left Hazeroth and went to Rithmah and set up their/our tents there.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Then they/we left Rithmah and went to Rimmon-Perez and set up their/our tents there.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>Then they/we left Rimmon-Perez and went to Libnah and set up their/our tents there.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>Then they/we left Libnah and went to Rissah and set up their/our tents there.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>Then they/we left Rissah and set up their/our tents at Kehelathah.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>Then they/we left Kehelathah and went to Shepher Mountain and set up their/our tents there.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>Then they/we left Shepher and went to Haradah Mountain and set up their/our tents there.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>Then they/we left Haradah and went to Makheloth and set up their/our tents there.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>Then they/we left Makheloth and went to Tahath and set up their/our tents there.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>Then they/we left Tahath and went to Terah and set up their/our tents there.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>Then they/we left Terah and went to Mithcah and set up their/our tents there.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>Then they/we left Mithcah and went to Hashmonah and set up their/our tents there.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>Then they/we left Hashmonah and went to Moseroth and set up their/our tents there.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>Then they/we left Moseroth and went to Bene-Jaakan and set up their/our tents there.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>Then they/we left Bene-Jaakan and went to Hor-Haggidgad and set up their/our tents there.</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>Then they/we left Hor-Haggidgad and went to Jotbathah and set up their/our tents there.</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>Then they/we left Jotbathah and went to Abronah and set up their/our tents there.</p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>Then they/we left Abronah and went to Ezion-Geber and set up their/our tents there.</p><p>
    <sup>36</sup>Then they/we left Ezion-Geber and went to Zin Desert and set up their/our tents at Kadesh there.</p><p>
    <sup>37</sup>Then they/we left Kadesh and went to Hor Mountain, at the border of Edom land and set up their/our tents there. <sup>38</sup>Aaron, the priest, obeyed Yahweh and climbed up the mountain. There he died, on the first day of their/our fifth month, 40 years after the/we Israelis left Egypt. <sup>39</sup>Aaron was 123 years old when he died.</p><p>
    <sup>40</sup>(That was when the king of Arad city heard that the/we Israelis were coming. Arad was in the southern part of Canaan, where the Canaan people-group lived.)</p><p>
    <sup>41</sup>The Israelis left Hor Mountain and went to Zalmonah and set up their/our tents there.</p><p>
    <sup>42</sup>Then they/we left Zalmonah and went to Punon and set up their/our tents there.</p><p>
    <sup>43</sup>Then they/we left Punon and went to Oboth and set up their/our tents there.</p><p>
    <sup>44</sup>Then they/we left Oboth and went to Iye-Abarim, which was on the border of the Moab region, and set up their/our tents there.</p><p>
    <sup>45</sup>Then they/we left Iye-Abarim and went to Dibon-Gad and set up their/our tents there.</p><p>
    <sup>46</sup>Then they/we left Dibon-Gad and set up their/our tents at Almon-Diblathaim.</p><p>
    <sup>47</sup>Then they/we left Almon-Diblathaim and went to the Abarim Mountains, near Nebo and set up their/our tents there.</p><p>
    <sup>48</sup>Then they/we left the Abarim Mountains and went to the plains of the Moab region, near the Jordan River, across from Jericho. <sup>49</sup>They/We set up our tents there; their/our tents stretched for several miles/km. from Beth-Jeshimoth to Acacia.</p><p>
    <sup>50</sup>While we were there on the plains of the Moab region near the Jordan River, across from Jericho, Yahweh spoke to Moses/me. He said, <sup>51</sup>“Tell this to the Israeli people: When you cross the Jordan River and enter the Canaan region, <sup>52</sup>you must force all the people who live there to leave. Destroy all their carved statues and all their idols made of metal. Wreck all the places where they worship their idols. <sup>53</sup>Take their land from them and start to live there, because I have given their land to you for you to own.</p><p>
    <sup>54</sup>“Divide up the land by throwing ◄lots/small stones which have been marked► to decide which group will get which area. Give the larger areas to the groups that have more people, and give the smaller areas to the groups that have fewer people. Each tribe will receive its own land. <sup>55</sup>If you do not force the people who live there to leave, they will cause you to have much trouble. They will be like sharp hooks in your eyes, and like thorns in your sides. And they will bring trouble to you, in that land where you will be living. <sup>56</sup>And then I will punish you, as I had planned to punish them.”</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-34"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-34">34</h3></a>
<p>The boundaries of the land of Canaan</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh said to Moses/me, <sup>2</sup>“Tell this to the Israeli people: You will soon enter Canaan land, and it will become yours. These will be the borders of the land: <sup>3</sup>On the south you will receive part of the Zin Desert, near the border of the Edom region. On the east side, the border will start at the south end of the Dead Sea.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>It will extend to a little south of the Scorpion Pass, and extend west through the Zin Desert and south of Kadesh-Barnea. From there it will extend to Hazar Addar and from there to Azmon. <sup>5</sup>From Azmon it will extend west to the dry riverbed at the border of Egypt and then to the Mediterranean Sea.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>The border on the west will be the Mediterranean Sea.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>The border on the north will start from the Mediterranean Sea and extend east to Hor Mountain. <sup>8</sup>From there it will extend to Lebo-Hamath and then to Zedad. <sup>9</sup>From there the border will extend to Ziphron, and it will end at Hazar-Enan.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>The border on the east will start at Hazar-Enan and extend south to Shepham. <sup>11</sup>From there it will extend east of Ain to Riblah and then along the hills that are east of Galilee Lake. <sup>12</sup>Then the border will extend south along the Jordan River and end at the Dead Sea.</p><p>Those will be the borders around your country.”</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>So Moses/I told all that to the Israeli people. Then he/I said to them, “That is the land that you will receive. You must throw ◄lots/stones that have been marked► to decide which area will go to each of the nine and a half tribes, because Yahweh has commanded that it should be divided among them. <sup>14</sup>The tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half of the tribe of Manasseh have already received the land in which they will live. <sup>15</sup>They have received land on the east side of the Jordan River, across from Jericho.”</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, <sup>17</sup>“These are the men who will divide the land: First, Eleazar and Joshua. <sup>18</sup>But one leader from each of the twelve tribes will help them divide the land.</p><p>
    <sup>19-28</sup>“From the tribe of Judah, appoint Jephunneh’s son Caleb.</p><p>From the tribe of Simeon appoint Ammihud’s son Shemuel.</p><p>From the tribe of Benjamin appoint Kislon’s son Elidad.</p><p>From the tribe of Dan appoint Jogli’s son Bukki.</p><p>From the tribe of Manasseh appoint Ephod’s son Hanniel.</p><p>From the tribe of Ephraim appoint Shiphtan’s son Kemuel.</p><p>From the tribe of Zebulun appoint Parnach’s son Elizaphan.</p><p>From the tribe of Issachar appoint Azzan’s son Paltiel.</p><p>From the tribe of Asher appoint Shelomi’s son Ahihud.</p><p>From the tribe of Naphtali appoint Ammihud’s son Pedahel.”</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>Yahweh commanded that all those were the men who should divide the Canaan region among the Israeli people.</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-35"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-35">35</h3></a>
<p>The towns given to the Levites</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh told this to Moses/me while the Israeli people were on the plain in the Moab region near the Jordan River, across from Jericho: <sup>2</sup>“Tell the Israeli people that from the land that they will receive, they must give to the descendants of Levi some cities in which they can live. They must also give them some land around these cities. <sup>3</sup>Those will be for the descendants of Levi to live in, and around the cities will be land for their cattle and flocks of sheep and goats and other animals.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>“The land that you give them for their animals must extend out for ◄1,500 feet/450 meters► from the walls of the cities. <sup>5</sup>Also measure ◄3,000 feet/900 meters► in each direction out from the walls of each city. That additional land will be land for their animals outside the walls of the cities.”</p><p>The cities of safety</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>“Six of the cities that you give to the descendants of Levi will be cities to which people can run to be safe. If someone accidentally kills someone else, the one who killed that person may run to one of those cities to be safe. <sup>7</sup>You must also give to the descendants of Levi 42 other cities and the land around those cities, for their animals,. <sup>8</sup>The Israeli tribes that have the most people must give them more cities than the tribes that have fewer people give. Each tribe must give some of its cities to the descendants of Levi, but the tribes that have more land must give more cities, and the tribes that have less land will give fewer cities.”</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Yahweh also said to Moses/me, <sup>10</sup>“Tell this to the Israeli people: When you cross the Jordan River and enter the Canaan region, <sup>11</sup>you must choose some cities to which people can run to be safe/protected. If someone kills another person ◄accidentally/without planning to do that►, the one who killed that person may run to one of those cities and be safe. <sup>12</sup>One of the relatives of the person who was killed may think he must avenge his relative’s death by killing the murderer. But in that city, the killer will be safe because the people in that city would kill those relatives if they tried to get revenge there. The man who killed someone accidentally must be put on trial in a court. <sup>13</sup>You must set apart six cities to be cities to which someone who killed another person accidentally may run and be safe. <sup>14</sup>There must be three of those cities on the east side of the Jordan River and three that will be on the west side, in the Canaan region. <sup>15</sup>Those six cities will be cities where Israeli people may run to and be safe, and where foreigners and other people who are living among you can also run to and be safe. Any of those people who accidentally kills someone may run to one of those cities and be safe/protected there.</p><p>
    <sup>16-18</sup>“But you must consider that anyone who kills another person with an iron weapon or with a big rock or with a piece of wood, is a murderer, and the one who killed the other person must be executed. <sup>19</sup>A relative of the person who was murdered must be the one who executes the murderer as soon as he finds him. <sup>20</sup>If someone shoves another person over a cliff or throws something at another person <sup>21</sup>or hits that person with his hand/fist and causes that person to die, if he did it because he hated that person, then you must consider that he is a murderer, and must be executed. A relative of the person who was killed must be the one who executes the murderer as soon as he finds him.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>“But someone might accidentally shove someone else, or accidentally throw something at another person and hit him, not because he hates that person. <sup>23</sup>Or he might drop a rock on someone that he did not see. If the one who does that does not plan to hurt anyone and does not hate the person that was killed, <sup>24</sup>the people of that city must decide whether the relative of the dead person has the right to get revenge, or whether the one who killed the other person truly did it ◄accidentally/without planning to do it►. <sup>25</sup>If they decide that the killer planned to kill the other person, they must not allow him to stay in their city. But if they decide that it was done accidentally, they must protect the killer from being killed by the dead person’s relative. They must send the killer to one of the cities where he will be safe/protected, and allow him to stay there until the Supreme Priest dies. After that, the killer may go back to his home, because the dead person’s relative no longer has the right to get revenge.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>“But while the Supreme Priest is still living, the person who is in that safe city must not leave that city. <sup>27</sup>If he goes outside the city, and if a relative of the dead person finds him, that relative is permitted to kill that person, and people will not consider that the relative is guilty of murder. <sup>28</sup>The killer must stay in that city where he will be safe/protected until the Supreme Priest dies. He will be safe from revenge after that, because the death of the Supreme Priest will be considered to be a sacrifice to atone for that murder. After that, the killer may return to his home.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>“You must always obey those regulations, wherever you live.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>“If someone is accused of killing another person, the one who is accused may be executed only if there are people who saw him do it. There must be more than one witness; no one is permitted to be executed if there was only one ◄witness/person who saw him do it►.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>“If there is a murderer who truly should be executed, do not spare his life by accepting ◄a ransom/money for him not to be killed►. He must be executed.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>“If someone has run to a city where he will be safe/protected, do not allow him to give you money in order that you will permit him to return to his home before the Supreme Priest dies.</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>“You must execute people who truly murder others. If you did not do that, you would be causing the people who live in the land to become unacceptable to me. Anyone who deliberately kills an innocent person must be executed. <sup>34</sup>I am Yahweh, and I live among you Israelis, so do not spoil/pollute the land by allowing people to murder others without being punished.”</p><a href="#NUMBERS-c-36"><h3 id="NUMBERS-c-36">36</h3></a>
<p>Land for Zelophehad’s daughters</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>The family leaders of the clan of Gilead of the tribe of Manasseh went to Moses/me and the other family leaders of the Israeli people. <sup>2</sup>They said to Moses/me, “Yahweh commanded you, our leader, to apportion the land to the Israeli tribes by throwing ◄lots/stones that have been marked► to decide which group would get which area. Yahweh also commanded you to give the land that belonged to our fellow Israeli Zelophehad to his daughters. <sup>3</sup>But if his daughters marry men from the other Israeli tribes, that land will no longer belong to our tribe. People of other tribes will get it. So some of our land will no longer belong to us. <sup>4</sup>When the Year of Celebration comes, when all the land that has been bought by someone is returned to its original owners, the land that belonged to Zelophehad will belong to the tribes of the men that his daughters marry. So some of our land, the land that we received from our fathers, will be taken from us, and we will never own it again.”</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Yahweh told Moses/me what to reply to them, so Moses/I said this to them: “These men from the tribe of Manasseh are right. <sup>6</sup>This is what Yahweh is saying to the daughters of Zelophehad: ‘Each of you may marry anyone you want to, but you must marry only someone from your own tribe.’ <sup>7</sup>In that way, the land that belongs to Israelis will not be passed from one tribe to another tribe. Each Israeli will keep the land in the tribe that belonged to his ancestors. <sup>8</sup>A woman who inherits her father’s land may get married, but she must marry someone from her own tribe. In that way, every Israeli will keep the land that belonged to his ancestors. <sup>9</sup>The land must not be passed from one tribe to another tribe. Each Israeli tribe must keep the land that it received from its ancestors.”</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Zelophehad’s daughters obeyed what Yahweh told Moses/me. <sup>11</sup>The five daughters—Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah and Noah—married their cousins, their father’s relatives. <sup>12</sup>The men whom they married were from the tribe of Manasseh, so their land continued to belong to their father’s family and tribe.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Those were the commands [DOU] that Yahweh gave to Moses/me to tell to the Israelis, while they/we were on the plains of the Moab region, close to the Jordan River, across from Jericho.</p><a href="#NUMBERS-h">^</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-1">[1]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-2">[2]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-3">[3]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-4">[4]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-5">[5]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-6">[6]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-7">[7]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-8">[8]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-9">[9]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-10">[10]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-11">[11]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-12">[12]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-13">[13]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-14">[14]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-15">[15]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-16">[16]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-17">[17]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-18">[18]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-19">[19]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-20">[20]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-21">[21]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-22">[22]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-23">[23]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-24">[24]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-25">[25]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-26">[26]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-27">[27]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-28">[28]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-29">[29]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-30">[30]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-31">[31]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-32">[32]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-33">[33]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-34">[34]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-35">[35]</a> <a href="#NUMBERS-c-36">[36]</a>
