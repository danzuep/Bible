If you kill these people all at one time, the people-groups who have heard about your <span id="add-NUM.14.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">power</span> will say, <a href="#NUM.14.16"><sup id="NUM.14.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>

Because of that, not one of them will see the land that I promised their ancestors <span id="add-NUM.14.23" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that I would give to them</span>.

<span id="add-NUM.22.22" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Even though God had given Balaam permission to go, he was still angry</span>.

Balaam’s donkey saw the angel. The angel was standing in the road and was holding a sword in his hand, <span id="add-NUM.22.23" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">but Balaam did not see him</span>.</p>

Then the angel stood in a place where the road was very narrow, between two vineyards, with walls on each side of the road. <a href="#NUM.22.25"><sup id="NUM.22.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
When the donkey saw the angel standing there, it walked very close to the wall <span id="add-NUM.22.25" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to try to get past the angel</span>. As a result, it bashed Balaam’s foot against the wall. So Balaam struck the donkey again.</p>

This time, when the donkey saw the angel, it lay down <span id="add-NUM.22.27" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">on the ground</span> with Balaam sitting on top of it.

Then Yahweh enabled the donkey to speak! It said to Balaam, “What bad thing have I done to you that caused you to strike me three times?”</p>

    <a href="#NUM.22.31"><sup id="NUM.22.31" class="usx-v">31</sup></a>
Then Yahweh enabled Balaam to see the angel standing on the road, holding a sword in his hand. Balaam <span id="add-NUM.22.31" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">realized that it was an angel and</span> prostrated himself on the ground in front of the angel.</p>

    <a href="#NUM.22.32"><sup id="NUM.22.32" class="usx-v">32</sup></a>

    <a href="#NUM.22.34"><sup id="NUM.22.34" class="usx-v">34</sup></a>
Then Balaam said to the angel, “I have sinned. But I did not realize that you were standing there, trying to block my path. So if you do not want me to continue going, I will return home.”</p>
