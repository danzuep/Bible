I am very disappointed [IRO] that so soon <span id="add-GAL.1.6" class="usx-add">after you trusted in Christ</span> you have turned away from <span id="add-GAL.1.6" class="usx-add">God</span>. He chose you in order that <span id="add-GAL.1.6" class="usx-add">you might have what</span> Christ freely/kindly gives.

Their message is not a true message. <span id="add-GAL.1.7" class="usx-add">What is happening is that</span> certain persons are confusing your <span id="add-GAL.1.7" class="usx-add">minds</span>. They are desiring to change the good message ◄that Christ <span id="add-GAL.1.7" class="usx-add">revealed/about</span> Christ► <span id="add-GAL.1.7" class="usx-add">and are creating another message</span>. <a href="#GAL.1.8"><sup id="GAL.1.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
But even if we <span id="add-GAL.1.8" class="usx-add">(exc) apostles</span> or an angel from heaven would tell you a message that is different from the good message that we told you <span id="add-GAL.1.8" class="usx-add">before</span>, I <span id="add-GAL.1.8" class="usx-add">appeal to God</span> that <span id="add-GAL.1.8" class="usx-add">he</span> punish such a person <span id="add-GAL.1.8" class="usx-add">forever</span>. <a href="#GAL.1.9"><sup id="GAL.1.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
As I told you previously, so now I tell you this once more: Someone is telling you <span id="add-GAL.1.9" class="usx-add">what he says is</span> a good message, but it is a message that is different from <span id="add-GAL.1.9" class="usx-add">the good message</span> that I gave you. So I <span id="add-GAL.1.9" class="usx-add">appeal to God</span> that <span id="add-GAL.1.9" class="usx-add">he</span> severely punish that person. <a href="#GAL.1.10"><sup id="GAL.1.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
<span id="add-GAL.1.10" class="usx-add">I said that</span> because [RHQ] I do not desire that people approve me, <span id="add-GAL.1.10" class="usx-add">contrary to what some have said about me</span>.

My fellow believers, I want you to know that the message about Christ that I proclaim to people is not one that some person <span id="add-GAL.1.11" class="usx-add">created/thought up</span>. <a href="#GAL.1.12"><sup id="GAL.1.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
I did not receive this message from a human <span id="add-GAL.1.12" class="usx-add">messenger</span>, and no <span id="add-GAL.1.12" class="usx-add">human being</span> taught it to me. Instead, Jesus Christ revealed it to me.</p>

    <a href="#GAL.1.13"><sup id="GAL.1.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
People have told you how I used to behave when <span id="add-GAL.1.13" class="usx-add">I practiced</span> the Jewish religion. They told you that I continually did very harmful things to the groups of believers that God <span id="add-GAL.1.13" class="usx-add">established</span>, and they told you that I tried to get rid of those people. <a href="#GAL.1.14"><sup id="GAL.1.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
I practiced the Jewish religion more thoroughly than many <span id="add-GAL.1.14" class="usx-add">other Jews</span> who were my age practiced it. I much more enthusiastically tried to get others to obey the traditions that my ancestors <span id="add-GAL.1.14" class="usx-add">kept</span>. <a href="#GAL.1.15"><sup id="GAL.1.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
Nevertheless, before I was born, <span id="add-GAL.1.15" class="usx-add">God</span> ◄set me apart/selected me►. He chose me <span id="add-GAL.1.15" class="usx-add">to live eternally</span>, something that I did not deserve. <a href="#GAL.1.16"><sup id="GAL.1.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
He wanted me to know that Jesus is ◄his Son/the man who is also God►, so that I would tell others the message about him in regions where non-Jews live. But I did not immediately go to any human beings [SYN] in order to gain <span id="add-GAL.1.16" class="usx-add">an understanding of that message. I received it directly from Christ!</span>! <a href="#GAL.1.17"><sup id="GAL.1.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
I did not <span id="add-GAL.1.17" class="usx-add">immediately</span> leave Damascus and go to Jerusalem <span id="add-GAL.1.17" class="usx-add">for that purpose</span> to those who were apostles before I was. Instead, I went away to Arabia <span id="add-GAL.1.17" class="usx-add">region, a desert area</span>. Later I returned once more to Damascus <span id="add-GAL.1.17" class="usx-add">city</span>. <a href="#GAL.1.18"><sup id="GAL.1.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
Then three years after <span id="add-GAL.1.18" class="usx-add">God revealed this good message to me</span>, I went up to Jerusalem in order that I might meet Peter. But I stayed with him for <span id="add-GAL.1.18" class="usx-add">only</span> 15 days, <span id="add-GAL.1.18" class="usx-add">which was not long enough for him to teach me thoroughly about Christ</span>. <a href="#GAL.1.19"><sup id="GAL.1.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
I also saw James, the brother of our Lord <span id="add-GAL.1.19" class="usx-add">Jesus and the leader of the believers there, but</span> I did not see any other apostle. <a href="#GAL.1.20"><sup id="GAL.1.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
God knows that what I am writing to you is completely true [LIT]! <a href="#GAL.1.21"><sup id="GAL.1.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
After <span id="add-GAL.1.21" class="usx-add">I left Jerusalem</span>, I went to <span id="add-GAL.1.21" class="usx-add">the regions of</span> Syria and Cilicia. <a href="#GAL.1.22"><sup id="GAL.1.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
<span id="add-GAL.1.22" class="usx-add">At that time, people in</span> the Christian congregations that are in Judea <span id="add-GAL.1.22" class="usx-add">province</span> still had not met me [SYN] personally. <a href="#GAL.1.23"><sup id="GAL.1.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
They only heard <span id="add-GAL.1.23" class="usx-add">others say about me</span> repeatedly, “<span id="add-GAL.1.23" class="usx-add">Paul</span>, the one who was formerly doing harmful things to us, is now telling the <span id="add-GAL.1.23" class="usx-add">same message</span> which we believe and which formerly he was trying ◄to destroy/to cause people to stop believing►!” <a href="#GAL.1.24"><sup id="GAL.1.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
And they praised God because of <span id="add-GAL.1.24" class="usx-add">what had happened to</span> me.</p>
<a href="#GAL.2"><h3 id="GAL.2" class="usx-c">2</h3></a>
<p id="s1-GAL.2" class="usx-s1" >Finally, when I returned to Jerusalem and told Peter, James, and John what I always proclaim, they agreed that Barnabas and I were preaching the same message and serving the Lord just like they were.</p>

    <a href="#GAL.2.1"><sup id="GAL.2.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
After 14 years passed, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas. I took Titus also. <a href="#GAL.2.2"><sup id="GAL.2.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
But <span id="add-GAL.2.2" class="usx-add">I tell you that</span> I went up there because of what God revealed to me. <span id="add-GAL.2.2" class="usx-add">It was not because someone there asked me to come</span>. I told people what was the good message that I was preaching in regions where non-Jews live. But I talked privately to those whom your new teachers highly respect. I did that in order that what I was doing and what I had done [MET] might not become useless [MET] <span id="add-GAL.2.2" class="usx-add">as a result of people rejecting my message because they thought that I was teaching something that was not true</span>. <a href="#GAL.2.3"><sup id="GAL.2.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
But <span id="add-GAL.2.3" class="usx-add">even though the leaders of the believers usually insisted that when non-Jews trusted in Christ someone must circumcise them</span>, they did not even insist that Titus be circumcised, even though he was a Greek man who was with me. <a href="#GAL.2.4"><sup id="GAL.2.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
<span id="add-GAL.2.4" class="usx-add">I talked to them privately</span> because some people <span id="add-GAL.2.4" class="usx-add">successfully</span> pretended that they were fellow believers and associated with the true believers. They did that in order that they might observe closely what we do because we are free <span id="add-GAL.2.4" class="usx-add">from having to obey all the Jewish laws and rituals</span> because of our close relationship with Christ Jesus [MET]. Those people wanted to make us <span id="add-GAL.2.4" class="usx-add">like</span> slaves [MET] <span id="add-GAL.2.4" class="usx-add">of those rituals by convincing us that we cannot trust Christ solely but that we must also obey all the Jewish rituals</span>. <a href="#GAL.2.5"><sup id="GAL.2.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
But not even briefly did we <span id="add-GAL.2.5" class="usx-add">(exc)</span> do what they wanted <span id="add-GAL.2.5" class="usx-add">about circumcision. We(exc) resisted them</span> in order that the truth of the message about Christ might continue to <span id="add-GAL.2.5" class="usx-add">benefit</span> you. <a href="#GAL.2.6"><sup id="GAL.2.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
The <span id="add-GAL.2.6" class="usx-add">leaders in Jerusalem</span>, whom your new teachers respect, did not add anything to what I preach. <span id="add-GAL.2.6" class="usx-add">And I would add that</span> what status those leaders had did not influence me, because God does not favor certain/important persons [IDM] more than others. <a href="#GAL.2.7"><sup id="GAL.2.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Instead of those leaders adding to the message that I tell people, they understood that I had been given the good message {God had given the good message to me} so that I might proclaim it to the non-Jews [MTY], just like <span id="add-GAL.2.7" class="usx-add">God</span> had given the good message to Peter so that he might tell it to those who are Jews [MTY]. <a href="#GAL.2.8"><sup id="GAL.2.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
That is, just like <span id="add-GAL.2.8" class="usx-add">God</span> had empowered/authorized Peter in order that he might be an apostle <span id="add-GAL.2.8" class="usx-add">to bring God’s message</span> to the Jews [MTY], he also had empowered/authorized me in order that I might be an apostle to <span id="add-GAL.2.8" class="usx-add">bring his message to</span> the non-Jews. <a href="#GAL.2.9"><sup id="GAL.2.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
And <span id="add-GAL.2.9" class="usx-add">those leaders</span> knew that God had kindly given to me this special work. So James, Peter, and John, the ones whom your new teachers <span id="add-GAL.2.9" class="usx-add">respect because they are</span> leaders [MET] <span id="add-GAL.2.9" class="usx-add">of the believers</span>, shook hands with us [IDM] <span id="add-GAL.2.9" class="usx-add">to show that they agreed that Barnabas and I are serving the Lord just like they are, and that we are preaching the same message that they are preaching</span>. They also agreed that we <span id="add-GAL.2.9" class="usx-add">(exc)</span> are the ones whom God was sending to <span id="add-GAL.2.9" class="usx-add">tell his message to</span> non-Jews, but that God is sending them to <span id="add-GAL.2.9" class="usx-add">tell his message to</span> Jews [MTY]. <a href="#GAL.2.10"><sup id="GAL.2.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
They merely urged that we <span id="add-GAL.2.10" class="usx-add">(exc)</span> still remember to help the poor <span id="add-GAL.2.10" class="usx-add">fellow believers who live in Jerusalem</span>. That is exactly what I have been eager to do.</p>
<p id="s1-GAL.2.10" class="usx-s1" >Later I rebuked Peter for not behaving according to the gospel, in that he was encouraging non-Jews to adopt Jewish laws and rituals.</p>

    <a href="#GAL.2.11"><sup id="GAL.2.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
But <span id="add-GAL.2.11" class="usx-add">later while I was at</span> Antioch <span id="add-GAL.2.11" class="usx-add">city</span>, after Peter came there, I told him directly [SYN] that what he was doing was wrong. <a href="#GAL.2.12"><sup id="GAL.2.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
<span id="add-GAL.2.12" class="usx-add">This is what happened</span>: <span id="add-GAL.2.12" class="usx-add">Peter went to Antioch and started eating regularly with non-Jewish believers there</span>. Later there were certain <span id="add-GAL.2.12" class="usx-add">Jewish believers who</span> came <span id="add-GAL.2.12" class="usx-add">to Antioch who claimed that</span> James, <span id="add-GAL.2.12" class="usx-add">the leader of the congregations in Jerusalem</span>, had sent them. But when <span id="add-GAL.2.12" class="usx-add">those certain</span> men came, Peter gradually quit <span id="add-GAL.2.12" class="usx-add">eating</span> with the non-Jewish believers and would not associate with them. He was afraid that the Jewish <span id="add-GAL.2.12" class="usx-add">believers from Jerusalem would criticize him for associating with non-Jews</span>. <a href="#GAL.2.13"><sup id="GAL.2.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Also, the other Jewish <span id="add-GAL.2.13" class="usx-add">believers who were in Antioch</span> [SYN] acted ◄insincerely/in a way that they knew was not right► along with <span id="add-GAL.2.13" class="usx-add">Peter</span>. The result was that they convinced even Barnabas to <span id="add-GAL.2.13" class="usx-add">stop associating with the non-Jewish believers</span>! <a href="#GAL.2.14"><sup id="GAL.2.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>

But we should not ◄tire of/become discouraged while► doing what pleases God, because <span id="add-GAL.6.9" class="usx-add">eventually</span>, at the time <span id="add-GAL.6.9" class="usx-add">that God</span> has determined, we will receive a reward [MET], if we do not stop <span id="add-GAL.6.9" class="usx-add">doing the good things that we have been doing</span>. <a href="#GAL.6.10"><sup id="GAL.6.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
So, whenever we have opportunities, we should do <span id="add-GAL.6.10" class="usx-add">what is</span> good to all people. But especially we should do what is good to all our fellow believers.</p>

I am now writing this last part of this letter to you in my own handwriting. Notice the large letters with which I am now writing. I am doing this in order that I might emphasize this: <a href="#GAL.6.12"><sup id="GAL.6.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
Some Jewish believers are trying to force you to perform certain rituals so that other Jews will think highly of them. They are insisting that you be circumcised {that someone must circumcise you}. They are doing that only in order that other Jews would no longer ◄persecute them/cause them to suffer► for proclaiming that God will save us because of our trusting in what Christ accomplished when he died on the cross [MTY, MET]. <a href="#GAL.6.13"><sup id="GAL.6.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
The reason that I say that is that the ones who are insisting that you be circumcised {that someone circumcise you} do not themselves fully obey the laws that God gave to Moses. Instead, they desire that you let someone circumcise you in order that they might boast to those Jews who would ◄persecute them/cause them to suffer► that you did that because they insisted [MTY] that you do it. <a href="#GAL.6.14"><sup id="GAL.6.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
I myself, however, strongly desire that I never boast about anything like that. The only thing I will boast about is what our Lord Jesus Christ accomplished by dying on the cross [MTY]. Because of what Christ did on the cross, I no longer am interested in the things that those who do not trust Christ [MTY] think are important, and those people are no longer interested in the things that I [MET] think are important. <a href="#GAL.6.15"><sup id="GAL.6.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
I will boast about Christ dying on the cross because God is concerned neither that people are circumcised nor that people are not circumcised. Instead, he is concerned only that people conduct their lives in a completely new way. <a href="#GAL.6.16"><sup id="GAL.6.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
I pray that God will give inner peace and act kindly towards all who will act according to this new way of life. It is all those who live according to this new way of life who are now truly God’s people [MET], as the Israeli people were God’s people previously.</p>
<p id="s1-GAL.6.16" class="usx-s1" >I have suffered enough for declaring the truth about Jesus, so do not trouble me again.</p>
<p id="sr-GAL.6.16" class="usx-sr" >

    <a href="#GAL.6.17"><sup id="GAL.6.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
Finally, I say that people have persecuted me/caused me to suffer for declaring the truth about Jesus, and as a result I have scars on my body. Your new teachers do not have scars like mine! So do not trouble/bother me about these matters again!</p>
<p id="s1-GAL.6.17" class="usx-s1" >I pray that God may act kindly within you.</p>

My fellow believers, I pray that our Lord Jesus Christ will kindly accomplish what he desires within you. ◄Amen!/May it be so!►</p>
