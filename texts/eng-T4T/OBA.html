<p>Yahweh will punish the Edomites</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>This is a message that Yahweh our God gave to me, Obadiah, about the Edom people-group.</p><p>Yahweh our God has told me this about the people of Edom:</p><p>“I, Yahweh, have sent a messenger to other nations,</p><p>telling them to prepare to go and attack Edom.”</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>And Yahweh says this to the people of Edom:</p><p>“I will soon cause you to become the weakest and most despised nation on the earth.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Your capital city is high in the rocky cliffs,</p><p>and you are very proud;</p><p>you think that you are safe from being attacked by your enemies [RHQ],</p><p>but you [IDM] have deceived yourselves.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>And I tell you that even if you had wings and could fly higher than eagles fly,</p><p>and if you could make your homes among the stars,</p><p>I would bring you crashing down from there.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>When thieves break into someone’s house during the night,</p><p>they certainly [RHQ] steal only the things that they want.</p><p>And people who pick grapes always [RHQ] leave a few grapes on the vines.</p><p>But your country will be completely destroyed!</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Everything that is valuable will be taken away.</p><p>
    Your enemies will find and take away even the valuable things that you have hidden.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>All ◄your allies/nations who promised to help you► will turn against you,</p><p>and they will force you to leave your country/land.</p><p>Those with whom you have peace now will trick/deceive you and defeat you.</p><p>Those who eat meals with you now are planning to trap you,</p><p>and then they will say to you, ‘You are not [RHQ] as clever as you thought you were!’</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>I, Yahweh, declare that at the time that I destroy Edom,</p><p>I will punish the men who live in those cliffs who thought that they were wise.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>The soldiers from Teman town will become terrified;</p><p>all you people who are descendants of Esau will be ◄wiped out/killed►.</p><p>The reasons for Edom’s punishment</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>You acted cruel in a cruel way toward your relatives who are descendants of Jacob, the twin brother of your ancestor Esau.</p><p>So now you will be disgraced forever; you will be completely destroyed.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Foreigners entered the gates of Jerusalem</p><p>and ◄cast lots/threw small stones that were marked► to decide what valuable things they would take away;</p><p>but you were as bad as those foreigners,</p><p>because you just stood there and did not help the Israelis.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>You should not have ◄gloated/been happy► about the disaster that the Israelis were experiencing.</p><p>You should not have been happy when their towns were ruined.</p><p>You should not have made fun of them  when they were suffering.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>They are my people,</p><p>so you should not have entered their city gates when they were experiencing those disasters</p><p>and you should not have laughed at them.</p><p>And you should not have taken away their valuable possessions.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>You should not have stood at crossroads</p><p>to catch those who were trying to escape.</p><p>You should not have captured them and put them into the hands of their enemies</p><p>when they were experiencing those disasters.”</p><p>God will punish all the nearby nations</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>“There will soon be the time when I, Yahweh, will judge and punish all the nations.</p><p>And you people of Edom will experience the same disasters that you caused others to experience.</p><p>The same evil things that you have done to others will happen to you.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    My people in Jerusalem have been punished</p><p>because I was very angry with them.</p><p>
    It is as though [MET] they drank a cup of very bitter liquid  on Zion, my sacred hill.</p><p>But I will punish [MET] all the other nations even more severely,</p><p>and cause them to disappear completely.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>But some people in Jerusalem will escape,</p><p>and Jerusalem will become a very holy/sacred place.</p><p>Then the descendants of Jacob will conquer and possess again the land that truly belongs to them.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>The descendants [MTY] of Jacob and his son Joseph will be like [MET] a fire,</p><p>and the people [MTY] of Edom will be like [MET] stubble that will be completely burned in that fire.</p><p>Not one person will remain alive.</p><p>
    That will surely happen because I, Yahweh, have said it.”</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>The Israeli people who live in the southern desert are the ones who will capture Edom.</p><p>And those who live in the western foothills will capture the Phoenicia region and the areas of Ephraim and Samaria.</p><p>And people of the tribe of Benjamin will conquer the Gilead region.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>Those who were ◄exiled in/forced to go to► Babylon will return to their land</p><p>
    and capture the Phoenicia region as far north as Zarephath on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea.</p><p>People of Jerusalem who were captured and taken to Sardis, the capital city of the Lydia region, will capture the towns in the southern desert.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>The army of Jerusalem will attack Edom and conquer it,</p><p>and Yahweh will be their king.</p><a href="#OBADIAH-h">^</a> <a href="#OBADIAH-c-1">[1]</a>
