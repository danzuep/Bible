    <span id="add-1TI.1.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Something that all we believers</span> say is certainly true and is worthy for us to fully accept is that Christ Jesus came into the world in order to save sinful people <span id="add-1TI.1.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">so that God would not punish them for their sins</span>.

But some people strongly desire to be rich.

All kinds of bad things will happen to people who [PRS] desire to have a lot of money.

God, who gives life to all things, knows everything that you do. Christ Jesus also knows everything that you do.
