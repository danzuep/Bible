In the land named Uz, there was a man named Job. He was a very godly/righteous [DOU] man, who greatly respected/revered God and always avoided doing evil things. <a href="#JOB.1.2"><sup id="JOB.1.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
He had seven sons and three daughters. <a href="#JOB.1.3"><sup id="JOB.1.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
He owned 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 1,000 oxen, and 500 female donkeys. He also had many servants. He was the richest man in all the area east <span id="add-JOB.1.3" class="usx-add">of the Jordan River</span>.</p>
<p id="p-JOB.1.3" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JOB.1.4"><sup id="JOB.1.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
Each year, Job’s sons made feasts <span id="add-JOB.1.4" class="usx-add">in their houses</span> to celebrate their birthdays. Whenever each one made a feast, he would invite <span id="add-JOB.1.4" class="usx-add">all his brothers and</span> his three sisters to come and eat together. <a href="#JOB.1.5"><sup id="JOB.1.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
When each celebration ended, Job would summon them. He would get up early in the morning and kill animals and burn them on the altar as sacrifices, one for each of his children. He said to himself, “Perhaps <span id="add-JOB.1.5" class="usx-add">one of</span> my sons has sinned and said something evil about God in his heart.”</p>
<p id="s1-JOB.1.5" class="usx-s1" >Satan wanted to test Job</p>

    <a href="#JOB.1.6"><sup id="JOB.1.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
One day, the angels came and gathered together in front of Yahweh, and Satan came too. <a href="#JOB.1.7"><sup id="JOB.1.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Yahweh asked Satan, “Where have you come from?”</p>
<p id="p-JOB.1.7" class="usx-p" >Satan replied, “I have come from the earth, where I been traveling back and forth, seeing what is happening.”</p>
<p id="p-JOB.1.7" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JOB.1.8"><sup id="JOB.1.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
Yahweh said to Satan, “Have you ◄noticed/thought about► my <span id="add-JOB.1.8" class="usx-add">faithful</span> servant Job?

There is no one else on the earth like him.” <a href="#JOB.1.9"><sup id="JOB.1.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
Satan replied to Yahweh, “<span id="add-JOB.1.9" class="usx-add">What you say is true</span>, but Job greatly respects you <span id="add-JOB.1.9" class="usx-add">only</span> because of what <span id="add-JOB.1.9" class="usx-add">you have done for him</span> [RHQ]. <a href="#JOB.1.10"><sup id="JOB.1.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>

But if you take away [MTY] everything that he has, he will curse you openly. [IDM]”</p>
<p id="p-JOB.1.11" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JOB.1.12"><sup id="JOB.1.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
Yahweh replied to Satan, “◄All right/Okay►, I will permit you to take away everything that he has. But do not harm him.”</p>
<p id="p-JOB.1.12" class="usx-p" >Then Satan left, <span id="add-JOB.1.12" class="usx-add">and he prepared to cause many disastrous things to happen to Job</span>.</p>

One day <span id="add-JOB.1.13" class="usx-add">after that</span>, Job’s sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the home of their oldest brother. <a href="#JOB.1.14"><sup id="JOB.1.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
While they were doing that, a messenger arrived at Job’s home and said to him, “While your oxen were plowing <span id="add-JOB.1.14" class="usx-add">the fields</span> and the donkeys were grazing nearby, <a href="#JOB.1.15"><sup id="JOB.1.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
a group of men from <span id="add-JOB.1.15" class="usx-add">the</span> Sheba <span id="add-JOB.1.15" class="usx-add">area</span> came and attacked us. They killed all your servants <span id="add-JOB.1.15" class="usx-add">who were working in the fields</span> and took away all the oxen and donkeys!

<p id="p-JOB.1.15" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JOB.1.16"><sup id="JOB.1.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
While he was still talking to Job, another messenger arrived. He said to Job, “Lightning from the sky [MTY] struck and killed all the sheep and all the men who were taking care of the sheep!

    <a href="#JOB.1.17"><sup id="JOB.1.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
While he was still talking to Job, another messenger arrived. He said to Job, “Three groups <span id="add-JOB.1.17" class="usx-add">of robbers/bandits</span> from Chaldea <span id="add-JOB.1.17" class="usx-add">land</span> came and attacked us.

<p id="p-JOB.1.17" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JOB.1.18"><sup id="JOB.1.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
While he was still talking to Job, another messenger arrived and reported this to Job: “Your sons and daughters were feasting in the home of their oldest brother. <a href="#JOB.1.19"><sup id="JOB.1.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
Suddenly a ◄very strong wind/tornado► came from the desert and struck the house. The house collapsed on your sons and daughters and killed them all! I am the only one who escaped to <span id="add-JOB.1.19" class="usx-add">come and</span> tell you <span id="add-JOB.1.19" class="usx-add">what happened</span>.”</p>
<p id="p-JOB.1.19" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JOB.1.20"><sup id="JOB.1.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
Job stood up, and tore his robe and shaved his head <span id="add-JOB.1.20" class="usx-add">because he was very sad/grieved</span>. Then he prostrated himself on the ground <span id="add-JOB.1.20" class="usx-add">to worship God</span>. <a href="#JOB.1.21"><sup id="JOB.1.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
He said,</p>
<p id="q1-JOB.1.21" class="usx-q1" >“When I was born, I had no clothes on.</p>

<p id="q1-JOB.1.21" class="usx-q1" >But ◄we should/I will► always praise Yahweh <span id="add-JOB.1.21" class="usx-add">anyway</span>! [MTY]”</p>
<p id="p-JOB.1.21" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JOB.1.22"><sup id="JOB.1.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
In spite of all these <span id="add-JOB.1.22" class="usx-add">things that happened to </span> Job, <span id="add-JOB.1.22" class="usx-add">he </span> did not sin by saying that what God had done was wrong.</p>
<a href="#JOB.2"><h3 id="JOB.2" class="usx-c">2</h3></a>
<p id="s1-JOB.2" class="usx-s1" >Satan wanted to test Job again</p>
<p id="p-JOB.2" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JOB.2.1"><sup id="JOB.2.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
On another day, the angels came again and gathered together in front of Yahweh, and Satan came too. <a href="#JOB.2.2"><sup id="JOB.2.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
Yahweh asked Satan, “Where have you come from?” Satan replied, “I have come from the earth, where I have been traveling back and forth, seeing what is happening.”</p>
<p id="p-JOB.2.2" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JOB.2.3"><sup id="JOB.2.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
Yahweh asked Satan, “Have you ◄noticed/thought about► my <span id="add-JOB.2.3" class="usx-add">faithful</span> servant Job?</p>
<p id="p-JOB.2.3" class="usx-p" >He is very godly/righteous [DOU], he greatly respects/reveres me, and he <span id="add-JOB.2.3" class="usx-add">always</span> avoids doing evil things.

<p id="p-JOB.2.3" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JOB.2.4"><sup id="JOB.2.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
Satan replied to Yahweh, “He praises you only because you bless him [IDM]. People will give up everything they have to save their own lives. <a href="#JOB.2.5"><sup id="JOB.2.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
But if you harm his body [MTY], he will surely curse you openly [IDM]!”</p>
<p id="p-JOB.2.5" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JOB.2.6"><sup id="JOB.2.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
Yahweh replied to Satan, “◄All right/Okay►, you may do to him whatever you want to do, but do not cause him to die.”</p>
<p id="p-JOB.2.6" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JOB.2.7"><sup id="JOB.2.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
So Satan left, and he caused Job to be afflicted with very painful boils, from the top of his head to the soles of his feet. <a href="#JOB.2.8"><sup id="JOB.2.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped the boils on his skin, and he sat in ashes <span id="add-JOB.2.8" class="usx-add">as people did when they were mourning for those who had died</span>.</p>
<p id="p-JOB.2.8" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JOB.2.9"><sup id="JOB.2.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
His wife said to him, “Are you still trying to ◄be loyal to/faithfully trust in► God? You should curse God, and then you will die.”</p>
<p id="p-JOB.2.9" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JOB.2.10"><sup id="JOB.2.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
But Job replied, “You talk like people who do not know God talk. ◄Should we accept only the good things that God <span id="add-JOB.2.10" class="usx-add">does for us</span>?/We should not accept only the good things that God <span id="add-JOB.2.10" class="usx-add">does for us</span>.► [RHQ] We should also accept bad things.” So in spite of all these <span id="add-JOB.2.10" class="usx-add">things that happened to</span> Job, <span id="add-JOB.2.10" class="usx-add">he</span> did not say anything against God.</p>

Among Job’s friends were Eliphaz from Teman <span id="add-JOB.2.11" class="usx-add">town</span>, Bildad from Shuah <span id="add-JOB.2.11" class="usx-add">land</span> and Zophar from Naamah <span id="add-JOB.2.11" class="usx-add">land</span>. When they heard about all the terrible things that had happened to Job, they left their home areas and went together to Job to console/comfort him [DOU]. <a href="#JOB.2.12"><sup id="JOB.2.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
When they saw Job from a distance, they almost did not recognize him. They wailed loudly, they tore their robes, and they threw dust over their heads <span id="add-JOB.2.12" class="usx-add">to show how sorry they were because of what had happened to Job</span>. <a href="#JOB.2.13"><sup id="JOB.2.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Then they sat on the ground with Job for seven days. None of them said anything to Job, because they saw that he was suffering greatly, <span id="add-JOB.2.13" class="usx-add">and they did not think that anything that they said would lessen his pain</span>.</p>
