    <a href="#RUT.1.1"><sup id="RUT.1.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
During the time before kings ruled Israel, ◄there was a famine/the people there had nothing to eat►. There was a man who lived there whose name was Elimelech. His wife’s name was Naomi, and his sons’ names were Mahlon and Chilion. They were all from Bethlehem <span id="add-RUT.1.1" class="usx-add">town</span>, from the Ephrath <span id="add-RUT.1.1" class="usx-add">clan</span> in Judah <span id="add-RUT.1.1" class="usx-add">region</span>. <a href="#RUT.1.2"><sup id="RUT.1.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
Because of the famine, they left Bethlehem and went east to <span id="add-RUT.1.2" class="usx-add">live for a while in</span> Moab <span id="add-RUT.1.2" class="usx-add">region</span>.</p>
<p id="p-RUT.1.2" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#RUT.1.3"><sup id="RUT.1.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
While they were there, Elimelech died, and Naomi had only her two sons with her. <a href="#RUT.1.4"><sup id="RUT.1.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
They married women from Moab. One of them was named Orpah, and the other one was named Ruth. But after they had lived in that area for about ten years, <a href="#RUT.1.5"><sup id="RUT.1.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
Mahlon and Chilion died. So then Naomi had no husband and no sons.</p>
<p id="p-RUT.1.5" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#RUT.1.6"><sup id="RUT.1.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
One day while Naomi was in Moab, she heard someone say that Yahweh had helped his people in Israel and that now there was plenty of food to eat. So she prepared to return <span id="add-RUT.1.6" class="usx-add">to Bethlehem</span>. <a href="#RUT.1.7"><sup id="RUT.1.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
She left the place where she had been living and started to walk <span id="add-RUT.1.7" class="usx-add">with her daughters-in-law</span> along the road back to Judah. <a href="#RUT.1.8"><sup id="RUT.1.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
Then as the three of them were walking, Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Each of you should turn around and go back to your mother’s home. You treated <span id="add-RUT.1.8" class="usx-add">your husbands</span> kindly <span id="add-RUT.1.8" class="usx-add">before</span> they died, and you have treated me kindly. <a href="#RUT.1.9"><sup id="RUT.1.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
Now I desire that Yahweh will enable each of you to have another husband in whose home you will <span id="add-RUT.1.9" class="usx-add">feel</span> secure.” Then she kissed both of them, and they cried aloud. <a href="#RUT.1.10"><sup id="RUT.1.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
They each said, “No, we want to go with you as you return to your relatives.”</p>
<p id="p-RUT.1.10" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#RUT.1.11"><sup id="RUT.1.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
But Naomi said, “No, my daughters, return home. ◄It will not do any good for you to come with me!/What good will it do for you to come with me?► [RHQ] Do you think I will get married again and have more sons who could become your husbands? <a href="#RUT.1.12"><sup id="RUT.1.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
Even if I thought I could have another husband, and even if I got married today and became pregnant [EUP] tonight and later gave birth to sons, <a href="#RUT.1.13"><sup id="RUT.1.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
would you remain single/unmarried until they grew up <span id="add-RUT.1.13" class="usx-add">and became old enough</span> for you to marry? No, my daughters, <span id="add-RUT.1.13" class="usx-add">you would not do that</span>. Your situations are bad <span id="add-RUT.1.13" class="usx-add">because your husbands have died, but it is possible that you will each marry again</span>. My situation is much worse, because Yahweh [SYN] has opposed me, <span id="add-RUT.1.13" class="usx-add">and now I am too old to get married again</span>.”</p>
<p id="p-RUT.1.13" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#RUT.1.14"><sup id="RUT.1.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
Then Ruth and Orpah cried again <span id="add-RUT.1.14" class="usx-add">because of what Naomi said</span>. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, <span id="add-RUT.1.14" class="usx-add">and left</span>, but Ruth clung to Naomi. <a href="#RUT.1.15"><sup id="RUT.1.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
Naomi said to her, “Look! Your sister-in-law is going back to her relatives and to her gods! Go back with her!” <a href="#RUT.1.16"><sup id="RUT.1.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
But Ruth replied, “No! Don’t urge me to leave you! I <span id="add-RUT.1.16" class="usx-add">want to</span> go with you. Where you go, I will go. Where you stay, I will stay. Your relatives will be my relatives, and the God you <span id="add-RUT.1.16" class="usx-add">worship</span> will be the God I <span id="add-RUT.1.16" class="usx-add">worship</span>. <a href="#RUT.1.17"><sup id="RUT.1.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
Where you die, I will die. Where you are buried, I will be buried. May Yahweh punish me severely if I separate from you. I will be separated from you only <span id="add-RUT.1.17" class="usx-add">when one of us</span> dies.” <a href="#RUT.1.18"><sup id="RUT.1.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
When Naomi realized that Ruth was very determined to go with her, she stopped urging her <span id="add-RUT.1.18" class="usx-add">to return home</span>.</p>
<p id="p-RUT.1.18" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#RUT.1.19"><sup id="RUT.1.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
So the two women continued walking until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived there, everyone in town was excited <span id="add-RUT.1.19" class="usx-add">to see</span> them. The women <span id="add-RUT.1.19" class="usx-add">of the town</span> exclaimed, “◄Can this be Naomi?/It is difficult to believe that this is Naomi!►” [RHQ] <a href="#RUT.1.20"><sup id="RUT.1.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
Naomi said to them, “Don’t call me Naomi, <span id="add-RUT.1.20" class="usx-add">which means ‘pleasant’</span>. Instead, call me Mara, <span id="add-RUT.1.20" class="usx-add">which means ‘bitter’</span>, because God Almighty has made my life very unpleasant. <a href="#RUT.1.21"><sup id="RUT.1.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
When I left here, I <span id="add-RUT.1.21" class="usx-add">felt</span> rich, <span id="add-RUT.1.21" class="usx-add">because I had a family</span>. But Yahweh has brought me back here and now I <span id="add-RUT.1.21" class="usx-add">feel</span> poor, <span id="add-RUT.1.21" class="usx-add">because I have no family</span>. Do not call me Naomi [RHQ]. <span id="add-RUT.1.21" class="usx-add">I feel as though</span> Yahweh has spoken against (OR, afflicted) me. Almighty <span id="add-RUT.1.21" class="usx-add">God</span> has caused me to experience a great tragedy.”</p>
<p id="p-RUT.1.21" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#RUT.1.22"><sup id="RUT.1.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
That <span id="add-RUT.1.22" class="usx-add">summarizes the account</span> of Naomi returning home along with her daughter-in-law Ruth, the woman from Moab. And <span id="add-RUT.1.22" class="usx-add">it happened that</span> when they arrived in Bethlehem, the barley <span id="add-RUT.1.22" class="usx-add">grain</span> harvest was just beginning.</p>
<a href="#RUT.2"><h3 id="RUT.2" class="usx-c">2</h3></a>
<p id="s1-RUT.2" class="usx-s1" >Ruth met Boaz</p>
<p id="p-RUT.2" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#RUT.2.1"><sup id="RUT.2.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
There was a man in Bethlehem who belonged to the clan of <span id="add-RUT.2.1" class="usx-add">Naomi’s dead husband</span>, Elimelech. He was rich and well-known/influential. His name was Boaz.</p>
<p id="p-RUT.2.1" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#RUT.2.2"><sup id="RUT.2.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>

    <span id="add-RUT.2.2" class="usx-add">One day</span> Ruth said to Naomi, “Let me go to the fields and pick up the grain left behind by the workers.” Naomi replied, “Go ahead, my daughter.” <a href="#RUT.2.3"><sup id="RUT.2.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
So Ruth went to the fields and began to pick up some of the left-over grain. And it happened that she was working in a field that belonged to Boaz, <span id="add-RUT.2.3" class="usx-add">the man</span> from the clan of <span id="add-RUT.2.3" class="usx-add">her dead father-in-law</span>, Elimelech!</p>
<p id="p-RUT.2.3" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#RUT.2.4"><sup id="RUT.2.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
Just then, Boaz arrived from Bethlehem. He greeted the men who were harvesting the grain, saying, “I want Yahweh to bless you!” They replied, “We want Yahweh to bless you, <span id="add-RUT.2.4" class="usx-add">too</span>!”</p>
<p id="p-RUT.2.4" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#RUT.2.5"><sup id="RUT.2.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
Then Boaz saw Ruth, and asked the ◄foreman/man in charge of the other workmen►, “Whose <span id="add-RUT.2.5" class="usx-add">daughter</span> is that young woman?” <a href="#RUT.2.6"><sup id="RUT.2.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
The foreman replied, “She is the woman from Moab who returned from there with <span id="add-RUT.2.6" class="usx-add">her mother-in-law</span> Naomi. <a href="#RUT.2.7"><sup id="RUT.2.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
She said to me, ‘Please let me walk behind the men who are harvesting the grain and pick up some of the grain they leave behind.’ <span id="add-RUT.2.7" class="usx-add">I gave her permission, and</span> she went into the field, and she has been working from this morning until now. The only time she did not work was when she rested for a short time in the shelter.”</p>
<p id="p-RUT.2.7" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#RUT.2.8"><sup id="RUT.2.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
So Boaz went over to Ruth and said to her, “Young lady, listen to me. Don’t go and pick up grain in another field. Do not go away from here. Stay here with my servant girls. <a href="#RUT.2.9"><sup id="RUT.2.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
Watch where the men are harvesting, and follow along behind the <span id="add-RUT.2.9" class="usx-add">servant</span> girls. I will tell the men <span id="add-RUT.2.9" class="usx-add">who are working</span> not to touch/molest you. And whenever you are thirsty, go and get some water to drink from the jars that the men have filled.”</p>
<p id="p-RUT.2.9" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#RUT.2.10"><sup id="RUT.2.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
When he said that, she knelt down in front of him <span id="add-RUT.2.10" class="usx-add">in respect</span>, with her face touching the ground. She exclaimed, “Why are you acting so kindly toward me, by paying attention to me? <span id="add-RUT.2.10" class="usx-add">I am not even a Jew; I am</span> a foreigner!” <a href="#RUT.2.11"><sup id="RUT.2.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
Boaz replied, “People have told me all about what you have done for your mother-in-law. They told me that you left your parents and your homeland, and you came here to live among people whom you did not know before. <a href="#RUT.2.12"><sup id="RUT.2.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
I hope/desire that Yahweh will repay you for what you have done. You have put yourself in the care of Yahweh, <span id="add-RUT.2.12" class="usx-add">like a little bird puts itself</span> under <span id="add-RUT.2.12" class="usx-add">its mother’s</span> wings [MET]. I desire that he will reward you very greatly.”</p>
<p id="p-RUT.2.12" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#RUT.2.13"><sup id="RUT.2.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
She replied, “Sir, I hope you will continue to act kindly toward me. You have comforted/encouraged me, even though I am lower in status than any of your servant girls.”</p>
<p id="p-RUT.2.13" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#RUT.2.14"><sup id="RUT.2.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
At mealtime, Boaz said to her, “Come over here. Take some bread and dip it in the wine vinegar <span id="add-RUT.2.14" class="usx-add">and eat it</span>.” Then when she sat down with the men who had been harvesting, he offered her some roasted grain. She ate all the grain she wanted, and had some left over. <a href="#RUT.2.15"><sup id="RUT.2.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
As she stood up to start gathering grain <span id="add-RUT.2.15" class="usx-add">again</span>, Boaz ordered his workers, “Even if she gathers some grain near the bundles of grain that have been cut, do not scold her. <a href="#RUT.2.16"><sup id="RUT.2.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
Instead, pull out some stalks of grain from the bundles, and leave them on the ground for her to pick up, and do not rebuke her.”</p>
<p id="p-RUT.2.16" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#RUT.2.17"><sup id="RUT.2.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
So Ruth gathered grain in the field until evening. Then she ◄threshed/beat with a stick► the barley that she had gathered, <span id="add-RUT.2.17" class="usx-add">to separate the kernels from the stalks</span>, and the barley filled a large basket. <a href="#RUT.2.18"><sup id="RUT.2.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
She carried it back to town, and showed to her mother-in-law how much she had gathered. Ruth also showed to her the grain <span id="add-RUT.2.18" class="usx-add">that was left over after</span> she had eaten enough from <span id="add-RUT.2.18" class="usx-add">what Boaz had given her at lunchtime</span>. <a href="#RUT.2.19"><sup id="RUT.2.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
Her mother-in-law asked her, “Where did you gather grain today? In whose <span id="add-RUT.2.19" class="usx-add">field</span> did you work? <span id="add-RUT.2.19" class="usx-add">God will</span> surely bless the man who was kind to you.” Then Ruth told her about the man in whose field she had been working. She said, “The name of the man <span id="add-RUT.2.19" class="usx-add">who owns the field</span> where I worked today is Boaz.” <a href="#RUT.2.20"><sup id="RUT.2.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “I hope/desire that Yahweh will bless him! He has not stopped acting kindly toward <span id="add-RUT.2.20" class="usx-add">us, who are still</span> living, and to <span id="add-RUT.2.20" class="usx-add">our husbands</span> who have died.” Then she added, “That man is a close relative <span id="add-RUT.2.20" class="usx-add">of Elimelech</span>; he is one of those who has a responsibility to help those who are his relatives.”</p>
<p id="p-RUT.2.20" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#RUT.2.21"><sup id="RUT.2.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
Then Ruth said, “He also said to me, ‘Stay with my workers until they have finished harvesting all my grain.’”</p>
<p id="p-RUT.2.21" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#RUT.2.22"><sup id="RUT.2.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
Naomi replied, “My daughter, it will be good for you to go <span id="add-RUT.2.22" class="usx-add">to his field</span> with his <span id="add-RUT.2.22" class="usx-add">servant</span> girls, because if you go to someone else’s field, someone might harm/molest you.”</p>
<p id="p-RUT.2.22" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#RUT.2.23"><sup id="RUT.2.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
So Ruth stayed close to Boaz’s <span id="add-RUT.2.23" class="usx-add">servant</span> girls <span id="add-RUT.2.23" class="usx-add">while she was working</span>. She gathered stalks of grain until the barley harvest and the wheat harvest were finished. During that time she lived with Naomi.</p>
<a href="#RUT.3"><h3 id="RUT.3" class="usx-c">3</h3></a>
<p id="s1-RUT.3" class="usx-s1" >Ruth asked Boaz to marry her so she would have a home and other things she needed</p>

    <a href="#RUT.3.1"><sup id="RUT.3.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
One day, Naomi said to Ruth, “My daughter, I think that I should [RHQ] try to arrange for you to have a husband [MTY] who will ◄take care of/provide for► you. <a href="#RUT.3.2"><sup id="RUT.3.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
Boaz, the man with whose <span id="add-RUT.3.2" class="usx-add">servant </span> girls you have been <span id="add-RUT.3.2" class="usx-add">gathering grain</span>, is a close relative <span id="add-RUT.3.2" class="usx-add">of our dead husbands</span>. Listen <span id="add-RUT.3.2" class="usx-add">carefully</span>. Tonight he will be at the ground where <span id="add-RUT.3.2" class="usx-add">the barley has</span> been threshed. He will be separating the barley grain from the chaff. <a href="#RUT.3.3"><sup id="RUT.3.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
Bathe yourself and put on some perfume. Put on your <span id="add-RUT.3.3" class="usx-add">best</span> clothes. Then go down to the ground where they have threshed <span id="add-RUT.3.3" class="usx-add">the grain</span>. But do not let Boaz know that you are there while he is eating <span id="add-RUT.3.3" class="usx-add">supper</span> and drinking. <a href="#RUT.3.4"><sup id="RUT.3.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
<span id="add-RUT.3.4" class="usx-add">When he has finished eating</span>, notice where he lies down to sleep.

<p id="p-RUT.3.4" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#RUT.3.5"><sup id="RUT.3.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
Ruth replied, “I will do everything that you have told me <span id="add-RUT.3.5" class="usx-add">to do</span>.” <a href="#RUT.3.6"><sup id="RUT.3.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
So she went down to the ground where they had threshed <span id="add-RUT.3.6" class="usx-add">the barley grain</span>. There she did everything that her mother-in-law had told her <span id="add-RUT.3.6" class="usx-add">to do</span>.</p>
<p id="p-RUT.3.6" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#RUT.3.7"><sup id="RUT.3.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
When Boaz finished eating <span id="add-RUT.3.7" class="usx-add">supper</span> and drinking <span id="add-RUT.3.7" class="usx-add">wine</span>, he felt happy. Then he went over to the far end of the pile of grain. He lay down <span id="add-RUT.3.7" class="usx-add">and went to sleep</span>. Then Ruth approached him quietly. She took the blanket off his feet and lay down <span id="add-RUT.3.7" class="usx-add">there</span>. <a href="#RUT.3.8"><sup id="RUT.3.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
In the middle of the night, he suddenly awoke. He sat up and saw that a woman was lying at his feet. <a href="#RUT.3.9"><sup id="RUT.3.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
He asked her, “Who are you?” She replied, “I am your servant, Ruth. Since you are the one who has a responsibility to take care of <span id="add-RUT.3.9" class="usx-add">someone like me whose dead husband was</span> your close relative, spread the corner of your cloak over my <span id="add-RUT.3.9" class="usx-add">feet to show that you will marry me</span>.”</p>
<p id="p-RUT.3.9" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#RUT.3.10"><sup id="RUT.3.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
Boaz replied, “Young lady, I hope that Yahweh will ◄bless/be kind to► you! You have acted kindly <span id="add-RUT.3.10" class="usx-add">toward your mother-in-law</span>, and now you are acting even more kindly <span id="add-RUT.3.10" class="usx-add">toward me by wanting to marry me, instead of wanting to marry a young man</span>. You have not looked for either a rich young man or a poor young man, <span id="add-RUT.3.10" class="usx-add">to marry him</span>. <a href="#RUT.3.11"><sup id="RUT.3.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
Now, young lady, I will do everything you ask. Don’t worry <span id="add-RUT.3.11" class="usx-add">that people in this town might think I am doing wrong by marrying you because you are a woman from Moab</span>. All the people in this town know that you are an honorable woman. <a href="#RUT.3.12"><sup id="RUT.3.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
But <span id="add-RUT.3.12" class="usx-add">there is one problem</span>. Although it is true that I am a close relative <span id="add-RUT.3.12" class="usx-add">of your mother-in-law’s dead husband</span>, there is another man who is a closer relative <span id="add-RUT.3.12" class="usx-add">than I am</span>, and therefore he should be the one to <span id="add-RUT.3.12" class="usx-add">marry you and</span> take care of you. <a href="#RUT.3.13"><sup id="RUT.3.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
You stay here for the rest of this night. Tomorrow morning <span id="add-RUT.3.13" class="usx-add">I will tell this man about you</span>. If he says that he will <span id="add-RUT.3.13" class="usx-add">marry you and</span> take care of you, fine, <span id="add-RUT.3.13" class="usx-add">we will</span> let him do that. But if he is not willing <span id="add-RUT.3.13" class="usx-add">to do that</span>, I solemnly promise that as surely as Yahweh lives, I will <span id="add-RUT.3.13" class="usx-add">marry you and</span> take care of you. So lie/sleep here until it is morning.”</p>
<p id="p-RUT.3.13" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#RUT.3.14"><sup id="RUT.3.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
So she lay at his feet until morning. But she got up and left before it was light enough that people would be able to recognize her, because Boaz said, “I do not want anyone to know that a woman was here.” <a href="#RUT.3.15"><sup id="RUT.3.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
He also said to her, “Bring to me your cloak and spread it out.” When she did that, he poured into it six measures/24 liters/50 pounds of barley, and put in on her back. Then he (OR, she) went back to the town.</p>
<p id="p-RUT.3.15" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#RUT.3.16"><sup id="RUT.3.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
When Ruth arrived home, her mother-in-law asked her, “My daughter, how did ◄things go/Boaz act toward you►?” Then Ruth told her everything that Boaz had done for her <span id="add-RUT.3.16" class="usx-add">and said to her</span>. <a href="#RUT.3.17"><sup id="RUT.3.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
She also said <span id="add-RUT.3.17" class="usx-add">to Naomi</span>, “He gave me all this barley, saying ‘I do not want you to return to your mother-in-law empty-handed.’&#160;” <a href="#RUT.3.18"><sup id="RUT.3.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
Then Naomi said, “My daughter, just wait until we see what happens. <span id="add-RUT.3.18" class="usx-add">I am sure that</span> Boaz will take care of [LIT] the matter <span id="add-RUT.3.18" class="usx-add">of your marriage </span>today. [LIT]”</p>
<a href="#RUT.4"><h3 id="RUT.4" class="usx-c">4</h3></a>
<p id="s1-RUT.4" class="usx-s1" >Boaz married Ruth</p>
<p id="p-RUT.4" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#RUT.4.1"><sup id="RUT.4.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>

    <span id="add-RUT.4.1" class="usx-add">Meanwhile</span>, Boaz went up to the town gate and sat there. <span id="add-RUT.4.1" class="usx-add">That was the place where people met together to decide important matters</span>. When the man that Boaz had mentioned came there, the close relative of Ruth and Naomi’s dead husbands <span id="add-RUT.4.1" class="usx-add">who had a responsibility to take care of Naomi and Ruth</span>, Boaz said to him, “My friend, come over here and sit down.” So the man went and sat down. <a href="#RUT.4.2"><sup id="RUT.4.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
Boaz then gathered ten of the elders of the town and asked them to sit down <span id="add-RUT.4.2" class="usx-add">there also</span>. After they sat down, <a href="#RUT.4.3"><sup id="RUT.4.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
he said to the man who had the responsibility to take care of Naomi, “Naomi has returned from Moab <span id="add-RUT.4.3" class="usx-add">region</span>. She wants to sell the field that belonged to our relative Elimelech. <a href="#RUT.4.4"><sup id="RUT.4.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
I thought that I should tell you about that, and suggest that you buy it, while these elders who are sitting here are listening. If you are willing to buy the property, do that. But if you do not want to buy it, tell me, so that I will know. I am suggesting this to you because you are the one who has the first right to buy it, and I am the one who has the second/next right to buy it.” The man replied, “I will buy it!” <a href="#RUT.4.5"><sup id="RUT.4.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
Then Boaz told him, “When you buy the land from Naomi, you will also be taking Ruth, <span id="add-RUT.4.5" class="usx-add">the woman</span> who is from Moab, <span id="add-RUT.4.5" class="usx-add">to be your wife</span>, in order that she may <span id="add-RUT.4.5" class="usx-add">give birth to a son who will </span> inherit the property of her dead husband [MTY].” <a href="#RUT.4.6"><sup id="RUT.4.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
Then the close relative <span id="add-RUT.4.6" class="usx-add">of Ruth’s dead husband</span> said, “<span id="add-RUT.4.6" class="usx-add">If that is so</span>, I do not <span id="add-RUT.4.6" class="usx-add">want to</span> buy the field, because then my own <span id="add-RUT.4.6" class="usx-add">children</span> would not inherit the property; <span id="add-RUT.4.6" class="usx-add">Ruth’s children would inherit it</span>. You buy the property!”</p>
<p id="p-RUT.4.6" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#RUT.4.7"><sup id="RUT.4.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
At that time, it was the custom in Israel, when a person bought property that belonged to another person, that the man who was selling the property would take off one of his sandals and give it to the one who was buying the property. That was the way they finalized sales in Israel. <a href="#RUT.4.8"><sup id="RUT.4.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
So that close relative said to Boaz, “You buy the field yourself!” And he took off <span id="add-RUT.4.8" class="usx-add">one of</span> his sandals <span id="add-RUT.4.8" class="usx-add">and gave it to Boaz</span>.</p>
<p id="p-RUT.4.8" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#RUT.4.9"><sup id="RUT.4.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
Then Boaz said to the elders and all the <span id="add-RUT.4.9" class="usx-add">other</span> people <span id="add-RUT.4.9" class="usx-add">who were there</span>, “Today you have all seen that I have bought from Naomi all the property that belonged to <span id="add-RUT.4.9" class="usx-add">her dead husband</span> Elimelech and <span id="add-RUT.4.9" class="usx-add">his dead sons</span> Mahlon and Chilion. <a href="#RUT.4.10"><sup id="RUT.4.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
I am also taking Ruth, <span id="add-RUT.4.10" class="usx-add">the woman</span> from Moab, Mahlon’s widow, to be my wife, in order that she may give birth to a son who will inherit the property of the dead man. In that way, Elimelech’s name will continue [LIT] among the members of his family and among all the people of this town. Today you all are witnesses <span id="add-RUT.4.10" class="usx-add">of what I have done</span>.”</p>
<p id="p-RUT.4.10" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#RUT.4.11"><sup id="RUT.4.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
All the elders and the <span id="add-RUT.4.11" class="usx-add">others</span> who were sitting at the <span id="add-RUT.4.11" class="usx-add">town</span> gate <span id="add-RUT.4.11" class="usx-add">agreed, and one of them</span> said, “<span id="add-RUT.4.11" class="usx-add">Yes,</span> we are witnesses. We hope/desire that Yahweh will enable this woman, who will be coming into your home, to give birth to many children, as Rachel and Leah did. They are the women from whom all <span id="add-RUT.4.11" class="usx-add">us</span> people [MTY] of Israel are descended. We hope that you will become rich in the clan of Ephratah, and become famous [MTY] <span id="add-RUT.4.11" class="usx-add">here</span> in Bethlehem. <a href="#RUT.4.12"><sup id="RUT.4.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
We hope/desire that Yahweh will enable you and this young woman to have many descendants. And we hope/desire that your family will be as important as the family of your ancestor Perez, the son of Judah and Tamar.”</p>
<p id="p-RUT.4.12" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#RUT.4.13"><sup id="RUT.4.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
So Boaz took Ruth <span id="add-RUT.4.13" class="usx-add">home</span>, and she became his wife. He ◄slept with/had sexual relations with► her [EUP] and Yahweh enabled her to become pregnant, and she gave birth to a son. <a href="#RUT.4.14"><sup id="RUT.4.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
The women <span id="add-RUT.4.14" class="usx-add">of Bethlehem</span> said to Naomi, “Praise Yahweh! Now he has given [LIT] you a grandson who will be the one who will have the responsibility to take care of you. We hope that he will become famous [MTY] throughout Israel. <a href="#RUT.4.15"><sup id="RUT.4.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
He will make you feel young again, and he will take care of you when you become old. Your daughter-in-law, who loves you, has given birth to a son, who will ◄be better to/do more for► you than <span id="add-RUT.4.15" class="usx-add">if you had</span> seven sons <span id="add-RUT.4.15" class="usx-add">of your own</span>.”</p>
<p id="p-RUT.4.15" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#RUT.4.16"><sup id="RUT.4.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
Then Naomi took the baby and put him on her lap, and took care of him. <a href="#RUT.4.17"><sup id="RUT.4.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
The women who were living near her said, “<span id="add-RUT.4.17" class="usx-add">It is as though</span> Naomi <span id="add-RUT.4.17" class="usx-add">now</span> has a son!” And they named him Obed. <span id="add-RUT.4.17" class="usx-add">Later</span>, Obed became the father of Jesse, and <span id="add-RUT.4.17" class="usx-add">later</span> Jesse became the father of <span id="add-RUT.4.17" class="usx-add">King</span> David.</p>
