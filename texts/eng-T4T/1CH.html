    <a href="#1CH.13.7"><sup id="1CH.13.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
The people put the Sacred Chest on a new cart and transported it from Abinadab’s house. Uzzah and Ahio were guiding <span id="add-1CH.13.7" class="usx-add">the oxen that were pulling the cart</span>. <a href="#1CH.13.8"><sup id="1CH.13.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>

Yahweh immediately became very angry with Uzzah, and he caused Uzzah to suddenly die there because he had put his hand on the Sacred Chest, <span id="add-1CH.13.10" class="usx-add">and Yahweh had commanded that only the descendants of Levi who help the priests should touch the Sacred Chest</span>.</p>

When the army of Philistia heard that David has been appointed to be king of all of Israel, they came to capture him.

Araunah replied, “Take it! Your majesty, do whatever you want to.

So Solomon sat on the throne <span id="add-1CH.29.23" class="usx-add">because Yahweh wanted him to be</span> the king to succeed his father David. <span id="add-1CH.29.23" class="usx-add">During the following years</span> Solomon prospered, and all the Israeli people obeyed him. <a href="#1CH.29.24"><sup id="1CH.29.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
King David’s other sons and all the officers and mighty warriors accepted Solomon as their king, and they solemnly promised to obey him.</p>

Jesse’s son David was the king who ruled all of Israel. <a href="#1CH.29.27"><sup id="1CH.29.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
He ruled for 40 years: Seven years in Hebron <span id="add-1CH.29.27" class="usx-add">city</span> and 33 years in Jerusalem. <a href="#1CH.29.28"><sup id="1CH.29.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
He became an old man who was very rich and greatly honored by all the people. Then he died, and his son Solomon became the king <span id="add-1CH.29.28" class="usx-add">of Israel</span>.</p>

A record of all the things that King David did while he ruled, from the beginning to the end, was put on scrolls written by the prophets Samuel, Nathan, and Gad. <a href="#1CH.29.30"><sup id="1CH.29.30" class="usx-v">30</sup></a>
