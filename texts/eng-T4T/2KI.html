One day, Ahaziah, <span id="add-2KI.1.2" class="usx-add">the new king of Israel,</span> fell through the wooden slats/boards around the edge of the flat roof <span id="add-2KI.1.2" class="usx-add">of his palace</span> in Samaria. He was badly injured, so he summoned some messengers and told them, “Go to Ekron <span id="add-2KI.1.2" class="usx-add">city in Philistia</span>, and ask their god Baalzebub whether I will ◄recover/become well►.”</p>
<p id="p-2KI.1.2" class="usx-p" >

    <span id="add-2KI.1.5" class="usx-add">So Elijah went to meet</span> the messengers <span id="add-2KI.1.5" class="usx-add">and told that to them, and they</span> returned to the king <span id="add-2KI.1.5" class="usx-add">instead of going to Ekron</span>. The king asked them, “Why did you return <span id="add-2KI.1.5" class="usx-add">so soon</span>?”</p>
<p id="p-2KI.1.5" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2KI.1.6"><sup id="2KI.1.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
They replied, “A man came to meet us, and said to us, ‘Return to the king who sent you and tell him that Yahweh says, “◄Is it because there no God in Israel that you are sending <span id="add-2KI.1.6" class="usx-add">messengers</span> to Ekron to consult Baalzebub, their god?/You seem to think there is no God in Israel, with the result that you are sending <span id="add-2KI.1.6" class="usx-add">messengers</span> to Ekron to ask Baalzebub, their god, <span id="add-2KI.1.6" class="usx-add">whether you will recover</span>.► [RHQ] <span id="add-2KI.1.6" class="usx-add">Go tell the king that</span> he will not recover from being injured; instead, he will surely die.”’”</p>
<p id="p-2KI.1.6" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2KI.1.7"><sup id="2KI.1.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
The king said to them, “The man who came to meet you and told that to you, what did he look like?”</p>
<p id="p-2KI.1.7" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2KI.1.8"><sup id="2KI.1.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
They replied, “He was a hairy man and he had a <span id="add-2KI.1.8" class="usx-add">wide</span> leather belt around his waist.” The king exclaimed, “That was Elijah!”</p>
<p id="p-2KI.1.8" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2KI.1.9"><sup id="2KI.1.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
Then the king sent an officer with 50 soldiers to seize Elijah. They found Elijah sitting on the top of a hill. The officer called out to him, “Prophet, the king commands that you come down here!”</p>
<p id="p-2KI.1.9" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2KI.1.10"><sup id="2KI.1.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
But Elijah replied, “I am a prophet; so, I command that fire come down from the sky and burn up you and your 50 soldiers!” Immediately, fire came down from the sky and completely burned up the officer and his 50 <span id="add-2KI.1.10" class="usx-add">soldiers</span>.</p>
<p id="p-2KI.1.10" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2KI.1.11"><sup id="2KI.1.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>

    <span id="add-2KI.1.11" class="usx-add">When the king found out about that,</span> he sent another officer with 50 more soldiers.

<p id="p-2KI.1.11" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2KI.1.12"><sup id="2KI.1.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
But Elijah replied, “I am a prophet; <span id="add-2KI.1.12" class="usx-add">to prove that,</span> I command that fire come down from the sky and kill you and your soldiers!” Then a fire from God came down from the sky and killed the officer and his soldiers.</p>
<p id="p-2KI.1.12" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2KI.1.13"><sup id="2KI.1.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>

    <span id="add-2KI.1.13" class="usx-add">When the king heard about that</span> he sent another officer with 50 more soldiers. <span id="add-2KI.1.13" class="usx-add">They went to where Elijah was</span>, and the officer prostrated himself in front of Elijah, and said to him, “Prophet, I plead with you, be kind to me and my 50 soldiers, and ◄do not kill us/allow us to remain alive►! <a href="#2KI.1.14"><sup id="2KI.1.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
<span id="add-2KI.1.14" class="usx-add">We know that</span> two times fire came down from the sky and killed officers and the 50 soldiers who were with them. So now, please be kind to me!”</p>
<p id="p-2KI.1.14" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2KI.1.15"><sup id="2KI.1.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
Then the angel from Yahweh said to Elijah, “Go down <span id="add-2KI.1.15" class="usx-add">and go </span> with him. Do not be afraid of him.” So Elijah went with them to the king.</p>
<p id="p-2KI.1.15" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2KI.1.16"><sup id="2KI.1.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>

    <span id="add-2KI.1.16" class="usx-add">When Elijah arrived,</span> he said to the king, “This is what Yahweh says: ‘You sent messengers to go to Ekron to ask Baalzebub, their god, <span id="add-2KI.1.16" class="usx-add">whether you would recover</span>.

So you will not recover from being injured; instead, you are going to die!’” <a href="#2KI.1.17"><sup id="2KI.1.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
So Ahaziah died, which is what Yahweh told Elijah would happen. Ahaziah’s <span id="add-2KI.1.17" class="usx-add">younger</span> brother Joram became the new king, when Jehoram, the son of Jehoshaphat, had been ruling Judah for almost two years.

Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here, because Yahweh has told <span id="add-2KI.2.2" class="usx-add">only</span> me to go to Bethel <span id="add-2KI.2.2" class="usx-add">town</span>.”</p>
<p id="p-2KI.2.2" class="usx-p" >But Elisha replied, “Just as certainly as Yahweh lives and you live, I will not leave you!”</p>
<p id="p-2KI.2.2" class="usx-p" >So they went down <span id="add-2KI.2.2" class="usx-add">together</span> to Bethel. <a href="#2KI.2.3"><sup id="2KI.2.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
A group of prophets came to Elisha <span id="add-2KI.2.3" class="usx-add">and Elijah before they entered the town</span>, and they asked Elisha, “Do you know that Yahweh is going to take your master/boss <span id="add-2KI.2.3" class="usx-add">Elijah</span> away from you today?”</p>
<p id="p-2KI.2.3" class="usx-p" >Elisha answered, “Certainly I know that, but don’t talk about it!” [IDM] <a href="#2KI.2.4"><sup id="2KI.2.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
Then Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here, because Yahweh has told <span id="add-2KI.2.4" class="usx-add">only</span> me to go to Jericho.”</p>
<p id="p-2KI.2.4" class="usx-p" >But Elisha replied <span id="add-2KI.2.4" class="usx-add">again</span>, “Just as certainly as Yahweh lives and you live, I will not leave you!”</p>
<p id="p-2KI.2.4" class="usx-p" >So they went <span id="add-2KI.2.4" class="usx-add">together</span> to Jericho <span id="add-2KI.2.4" class="usx-add">city</span>.</p>

    <span id="add-2KI.2.5" class="usx-add">As they neared</span> Jericho, a group of prophets who were from there came to Elisha and said to him, “Do you know that Yahweh is going to take your master/boss <span id="add-2KI.2.5" class="usx-add">Elijah</span> away from you today?”</p>
<p id="p-2KI.2.5" class="usx-p" >He answered again, “Certainly I know that, but don’t talk about it!” [IDM]</p>

    <a href="#2KI.2.6"><sup id="2KI.2.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
Then Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here, because Yahweh has told <span id="add-2KI.2.6" class="usx-add">only</span> me to go to the Jordan <span id="add-2KI.2.6" class="usx-add">River</span>.”</p>
<p id="p-2KI.2.6" class="usx-p" >But <span id="add-2KI.2.6" class="usx-add">again</span> Elisha replied, “As certainly as Yahweh lives and you live, I will not leave you!”</p>

Fifty men from a group of prophets <span id="add-2KI.2.7" class="usx-add">who were from Jericho</span> also went, but they watched from a distance as Elijah and Elisha stopped at the edge of the Jordan <span id="add-2KI.2.7" class="usx-add">River</span>. <a href="#2KI.2.8"><sup id="2KI.2.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
Then Elijah rolled up his cloak and struck the water with it. A path opened up for them through the river, and they walked across <span id="add-2KI.2.8" class="usx-add">as though they were</span> on dry ground.</p>
<p id="p-2KI.2.8" class="usx-p" >

When they came to the other side, Elijah said to Elisha, “What do you want me to do for you before ◄I am taken away/Yahweh takes me away►?”</p>
<p id="p-2KI.2.9" class="usx-p" >Elisha replied, “I want to receive twice as much of your power <span id="add-2KI.2.9" class="usx-add">as you have had,</span> (OR enable me to very powerfully continue your ministry).”</p>

Elijah replied, “You have asked for something which is difficult <span id="add-2KI.2.10" class="usx-add">for me to cause to happen</span>.

<p id="p-2KI.2.10" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2KI.2.11"><sup id="2KI.2.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
As they were walking and talking, suddenly a chariot that had fire <span id="add-2KI.2.11" class="usx-add">surrounding it</span>, pulled by horses which also had fire <span id="add-2KI.2.11" class="usx-add">surrounding them</span>, appeared. <span id="add-2KI.2.11" class="usx-add">The chariot driver</span> drove the chariot between Elijah and Elisha and separated them. Then Elijah was taken up to heaven in a ◄whirlwind/twisting wind►. <a href="#2KI.2.12"><sup id="2KI.2.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
Elisha saw it. He cried out, “My father/master! My father/master! The chariots of us Israeli people and their drivers <span id="add-2KI.2.12" class="usx-add">have taken my master away</span>!” <span id="add-2KI.2.12" class="usx-add">They disappeared into the sky,</span> and Elisha never saw Elijah again.

Elijah’s cloak <span id="add-2KI.2.13" class="usx-add">had fallen off when he was taken away, so</span> Elisha picked it up and returned to the bank of the Jordan <span id="add-2KI.2.13" class="usx-add">River</span>. <a href="#2KI.2.14"><sup id="2KI.2.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
He <span id="add-2KI.2.14" class="usx-add">rolled up the cloak and</span> struck the water with it, and cried out, “Will Yahweh, the God who <span id="add-2KI.2.14" class="usx-add">enabled</span> Elijah <span id="add-2KI.2.14" class="usx-add">to perform miracles, enable me to do similar things</span>?” Then the water separated, and a path opened up for him, and Elisha went across.</p>
<p id="p-2KI.2.14" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2KI.2.15"><sup id="2KI.2.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
When the group of prophets from Jericho saw what happened, they exclaimed, “Elisha now has the power that Elijah had!” [MTY] They walked over to him and bowed down in front of him. <a href="#2KI.2.16"><sup id="2KI.2.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
<span id="add-2KI.2.16" class="usx-add">One of</span> them said, “Sir, if you permit us, 50 of our strongest men will go and search for your master <span id="add-2KI.2.16" class="usx-add">on the other side of the river</span>.

<p id="p-2KI.2.16" class="usx-p" >Elisha replied, “No, do not send them.”</p>

But they kept insisting. Finally he was tired of saying “No,” and he said, “Okay, send them.” So 50 men searched for three days, but they did not find Elijah. <a href="#2KI.2.18"><sup id="2KI.2.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
They returned to Jericho, and Elisha was still there. He said to them, “I told you that you should not go, <span id="add-2KI.2.18" class="usx-add">because you would not find him</span>!” [RHQ]</p>

Then the leaders of <span id="add-2KI.2.19" class="usx-add">Jericho</span> city came to talk with Elisha. One of them said, “Our master, we have a problem.

    <a href="#2KI.2.20"><sup id="2KI.2.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
Elisha said to them, “Put some salt in a new bowl and bring the bowl to me.” So they brought it to him.</p>
<p id="p-2KI.2.20" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2KI.2.21"><sup id="2KI.2.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
Then he went out to the spring <span id="add-2KI.2.21" class="usx-add">from which the people in the town got water</span>. He threw the salt into the spring. Then he said, “This is what Yahweh says: ‘I have made this water good/pure.

Elisha left Jericho and went up to Bethel. As he was walking along the road, a group of young boys from Bethel <span id="add-2KI.2.23" class="usx-add">saw him and</span> started to make fun of him.

After Jehoshaphat had been ruling Judah for almost 18 years, Ahab’s son Joram became the king of Israel. He ruled in Samaria <span id="add-2KI.3.1" class="usx-add">city</span> for twelve years. <a href="#2KI.3.2"><sup id="2KI.3.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
He did things that Yahweh considered to be evil, but he did not do as much evil as his father and mother had done, and he got rid of the pillar <span id="add-2KI.3.2" class="usx-add">for worshiping</span> Baal which his father had made. <a href="#2KI.3.3"><sup id="2KI.3.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
But he committed the sins that <span id="add-2KI.3.3" class="usx-add">King</span> Jeroboam had committed and which led the Israeli people to sin, and he did not stop committing those sins.</p>

Mesha, the king of Moab, raised sheep. <span id="add-2KI.3.4" class="usx-add">Every year</span> he was forced to give 100,000 lambs and the wool from 100,000 rams to the king of Israel, <span id="add-2KI.3.4" class="usx-add">because his kingdom was controlled by the king of Israel</span>. <a href="#2KI.3.5"><sup id="2KI.3.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
But after King Ahab died, Mesha rebelled against the king of Israel. <a href="#2KI.3.6"><sup id="2KI.3.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
So King Joram left Samaria and gathered together all his soldiers. <a href="#2KI.3.7"><sup id="2KI.3.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Then he sent this message to Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah: “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. So will your army join my army and fight against the army of Moab?”</p>
<p id="p-2KI.3.7" class="usx-p" >Jehoshaphat replied, “Yes, we will help you. We are ready to do whatever you want us to. My soldiers and my horses are ready to help you.”</p>

    <a href="#2KI.3.8"><sup id="2KI.3.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
He asked, “On which road shall we march to attack them?”</p>
<p id="p-2KI.3.8" class="usx-p" >Joram replied, “We will go <span id="add-2KI.3.8" class="usx-add">south to Jerusalem, where your army will join us. Then we will all go south of the Dead Sea, and then turn north</span> through the Edom Desert.”</p>
<p id="p-2KI.3.8" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2KI.3.9"><sup id="2KI.3.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>

Jehoshaphat said, “Is there a prophet here who can ask Yahweh for us <span id="add-2KI.3.11" class="usx-add">what we should do</span>?”</p>

Elisha said to the king of Israel, “Why do you come to me [RHQ]? Go and ask those prophets that your father and mother consulted!”</p>
<p id="p-2KI.3.13" class="usx-p" >But Joram replied, “No, <span id="add-2KI.3.13" class="usx-add">we want you to ask Yahweh, because it seems that</span> Yahweh is going to allow us three kings to be captured by the army of Moab.”</p>

    <a href="#2KI.3.14"><sup id="2KI.3.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
Elisha replied, “I serve Yahweh, the commander of the armies of angels in heaven. As surely as he lives, if I did not respect Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not even think about doing anything to help you. <a href="#2KI.3.15"><sup id="2KI.3.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
But, bring a musician to me.”</p>
<p id="p-2KI.3.15" class="usx-p" >
    <span id="add-2KI.3.15" class="usx-add">So they did that</span>. And when the musician played <span id="add-2KI.3.15" class="usx-add">on his harp</span>, the power of Yahweh came on Elisha. <a href="#2KI.3.16"><sup id="2KI.3.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
He said, “Yahweh says that he will cause this dry stream-bed to be full of water. <a href="#2KI.3.17"><sup id="2KI.3.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
The result will be that your soldiers and your animals that carry supplies and your livestock will have plenty of water to drink. <a href="#2KI.3.18"><sup id="2KI.3.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
That is not difficult for Yahweh to do. <span id="add-2KI.3.18" class="usx-add">But he will do more than that</span>. He will also enable you to defeat <span id="add-2KI.3.18" class="usx-add">the army of</span> Moab. <a href="#2KI.3.19"><sup id="2KI.3.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
You will conquer all their beautiful cities, cities that have high walls around them. You must cut down all their fruit trees, stop water from flowing from their springs, and ruin their fertile fields by covering them with rocks.”</p>
<p id="p-2KI.3.19" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2KI.3.20"><sup id="2KI.3.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
The next morning, at the time when they offered the sacrifices <span id="add-2KI.3.20" class="usx-add">of grain</span>, they were surprised to see water flowing from Edom and covering the ground.</p>

    <a href="#2KI.3.21"><sup id="2KI.3.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
When the people of Moab heard that the three kings had come <span id="add-2KI.3.21" class="usx-add">with their armies</span> to fight against them, all the men who were able to fight in battles, from the youngest men to the oldest ones, were summoned, and they ◄took their positions/prepared to fight► at the <span id="add-2KI.3.21" class="usx-add">southern</span> border of their land. <a href="#2KI.3.22"><sup id="2KI.3.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
But when they rose early the next morning, they saw that the water across from them appeared to be as red as blood. <a href="#2KI.3.23"><sup id="2KI.3.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
They exclaimed, “It is blood! The three enemy armies must have fought and killed each other! So let’s go and take everything that they have left!”</p>
<p id="p-2KI.3.23" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2KI.3.24"><sup id="2KI.3.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
But when they reached the area where the Israeli soldiers had set up their tents, the Israelis attacked the soldiers from Moab and forced them to retreat. The Israeli soldiers pursued the soldiers from Moab and killed many of them. <a href="#2KI.3.25"><sup id="2KI.3.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
The Israelis also destroyed their cities. And whenever they passed fertile fields, they threw rocks on those fields, until the fields were covered with rocks. They stopped water from flowing from the springs and cut down the fruit trees. Finally, only <span id="add-2KI.3.25" class="usx-add">the capital city,</span> Kir-Hareseth, remained. The Israeli soldiers who threw stones with slings surrounded the city and attacked it. <a href="#2KI.3.26"><sup id="2KI.3.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
When the king of Moab realized that his army was being defeated, he took with him 700 men who fought with swords, and they tried to force a way through the Israeli lines of soldiers to escape to <span id="add-2KI.3.26" class="usx-add">get help from</span> the king of Syria, but they were unable to escape. <a href="#2KI.3.27"><sup id="2KI.3.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
Then the king of Moab took his oldest son, who would have become the next king, and killed him and offered him for a sacrifice <span id="add-2KI.3.27" class="usx-add">to their god Chemosh</span>, burning him on top of the city wall. The Israeli soldiers were horrified, with the result that they left that city and returned to their own country.</p>

Then take the jars into your house with your sons. Shut the door. Then pour olive oil from your container into the other jars. When each jar is full, set it aside <span id="add-2KI.4.4" class="usx-add">and fill another jar. Keep doing that until all the jars are full</span>.”</p>

Then he lay down on the boy’s body, and put his mouth on the boy’s mouth, and put his eyes on the boy’s eyes, and put his hands on the boy’s hands. Then the boy’s body started to become warm! <a href="#2KI.4.35"><sup id="2KI.4.35" class="usx-v">35</sup></a>

    <a href="#2KI.6.21"><sup id="2KI.6.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
When the king of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha, “Sir, shall I <span id="add-2KI.6.21" class="usx-add">tell my soldiers to</span> kill them? Shall we kill all of them?”</p>
<p id="p-2KI.6.21" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2KI.6.22"><sup id="2KI.6.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
Elisha replied, “No, you must not kill them. If your army captured many of your enemies in a battle, you would certainly not [RHQ] kill them. Give these men something to eat and drink, and then allow them to return to their king.” <a href="#2KI.6.23"><sup id="2KI.6.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
So the king of Israel did that. He told his servants to provide a big feast for them. And when they had eaten and drunk plenty, he sent them away. They returned to the king of Syria <span id="add-2KI.6.23" class="usx-add">and told him what had happened</span>. So for a while after that, soldiers from Syria stopped raiding/attacking towns in Israel.</p>
<p id="s1-2KI.6.23" class="usx-s1" >The army of Syria surrounded Samaria</p>

But some time later, Ben-Hadad, the king of Syria, assembled his entire army, and they went to Samaria and surrounded the city <span id="add-2KI.6.24" class="usx-add">for a long time</span>. <a href="#2KI.6.25"><sup id="2KI.6.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
Because of that, after a while there was hardly any food left inside the city, with the result that eventually a donkey’s head, <span id="add-2KI.6.25" class="usx-add">which was usually worthless,</span> cost eighty pieces of silver, and ◄one cup/0.3 liter► of dove’s dung cost five pieces of silver.</p>
<p id="p-2KI.6.25" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2KI.6.26"><sup id="2KI.6.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
One day when the king of Israel was walking on top of the city wall, a woman cried out to him, “Your Majesty, help me!”</p>

    <a href="#2KI.6.27"><sup id="2KI.6.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
He replied, “If Yahweh will not help you, I certainly cannot [RHQ] help you. I certainly [RHQ] do not have any wheat or wine! <a href="#2KI.6.28"><sup id="2KI.6.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
What is your problem?” She replied, “Several days ago, that woman <span id="add-2KI.6.28" class="usx-add">over there</span> said to me, ‘<span id="add-2KI.6.28" class="usx-add">Because we have nothing left to eat,</span> let’s kill your son today, in order that we can eat his flesh.

<p id="p-2KI.6.28" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2KI.6.29"><sup id="2KI.6.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>
So we <span id="add-2KI.6.29" class="usx-add">killed my son and cut his body up and</span> boiled his flesh and ate it. The next day, I said to her, ‘Now give your son to me, in order that we can <span id="add-2KI.6.29" class="usx-add">kill him and cook his flesh and</span> eat it.’ But she has hidden her son!”</p>
<p id="p-2KI.6.29" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2KI.6.30"><sup id="2KI.6.30" class="usx-v">30</sup></a>
When the king heard what the woman said, he tore his robe <span id="add-2KI.6.30" class="usx-add">to show that he was very distressed</span>. The people who were standing close to the wall were able to see that the king was wearing rough cloth underneath his robe <span id="add-2KI.6.30" class="usx-add">because he was very distressed</span>. <a href="#2KI.6.31"><sup id="2KI.6.31" class="usx-v">31</sup></a>
The king exclaimed, “I wish/hope that God will strike me dead if I do not cut off the head of Elisha today, <span id="add-2KI.6.31" class="usx-add">because he is the one who has caused these terrible things to happen to us</span>!”</p>

    <a href="#2KI.6.32"><sup id="2KI.6.32" class="usx-v">32</sup></a>
So the king sent an officer to get Elisha.</p>
<p id="p-2KI.6.32" class="usx-p" >Before the officer arrived, Elisha was sitting in his house with some Israeli elders who were talking with him.

And while he was still speaking, the king and the officer arrived.

Elisha replied to the king, “Listen to what Yahweh says: ‘He says that by this time tomorrow, at the marketplace here in Samaria, you will be able to buy ◄ten pounds/five kg.► of fine wheat or ◄20 pounds/ten kg.► of barley for <span id="add-2KI.7.1" class="usx-add">only</span> one piece of silver.’”</p>

    <a href="#2KI.7.2"><sup id="2KI.7.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
The king’s officer said to Elijah, “That cannot happen! Even if Yahweh himself would open the windows of the sky <span id="add-2KI.7.2" class="usx-add">and send grain down to us</span>, that certainly could not [RHQ] happen!” Elisha replied, “<span id="add-2KI.7.2" class="usx-add">Because you said that,</span> you [SYN] will see it happen, but you will not be able to eat any of the food!”</p>

That day there were four men who had ◄leprosy/a dreaded skin disease► who were sitting outside the gate of Samaria <span id="add-2KI.7.3" class="usx-add">city.

If we go into the city, we will die there, because there is no food there. If we remain sitting here, we will die here. So let’s go to where the army of Syria has set up their tents.

So when it was getting dark, those four men went to the camp where the army of Syria had set up their tents. But when they reached the camp, they saw that there was no one there!</p>
<p id="p-2KI.7.5" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2KI.7.6"><sup id="2KI.7.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
What had happened was that Yahweh had caused the army of Syria to hear something that sounded like a large army marching with chariots and horses. So they said to each other, “Listen!

So they all ran away that evening and left their tents and their horses and donkeys there, because <span id="add-2KI.7.7" class="usx-add">they were afraid that</span> they would be killed <span id="add-2KI.7.7" class="usx-add">if they stayed there</span>.</p>
<p id="p-2KI.7.7" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2KI.7.8"><sup id="2KI.7.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
When those four lepers came to the edge of the area where the soldiers of Syria had set up their tents, they went into one tent, <span id="add-2KI.7.8" class="usx-add">and saw all the things that had been left there</span>. So they ate and drank what was there, and they took the silver and the gold and clothes. Then they went <span id="add-2KI.7.8" class="usx-add">outside the tent</span> and hid those things. Then they entered another tent, and took things from there, and then went outside and hid them, also.</p>

    <a href="#2KI.7.9"><sup id="2KI.7.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
But then they said to each other, “We are not doing what is right. We have good news <span id="add-2KI.7.9" class="usx-add">to tell others</span> today. If we do not tell it to anyone now, and if we wait until morning to tell it, we will certainly be punished <span id="add-2KI.7.9" class="usx-add">by Yahweh</span>.

    <a href="#2KI.7.10"><sup id="2KI.7.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
So they went to the guards at the city gates and called out to them, “We went to where the army of Syria had set up their tents, but we did not see or hear anyone there. Their horses and donkeys were still tied up, but their tents were all deserted/abandoned!” <a href="#2KI.7.11"><sup id="2KI.7.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
The guards shouted the news, and some people <span id="add-2KI.7.11" class="usx-add">who heard it</span> went to the palace and reported it there.</p>

    <span id="add-2KI.7.12" class="usx-add">When</span> the king <span id="add-2KI.7.12" class="usx-add">heard it, he</span> got up out of his bed and said to his officials, “I will tell you what the army of Syria is planning to do.

<p id="p-2KI.7.12" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2KI.7.13"><sup id="2KI.7.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
But one of his officials said, “Many of our Israeli people have already died <span id="add-2KI.7.13" class="usx-add">from ◄hunger/not having anything to eat</span>►.

    <a href="#2KI.7.14"><sup id="2KI.7.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
So they chose some men and told them to go in a chariot and find out what had happened to the army of Syria. <a href="#2KI.7.15"><sup id="2KI.7.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
They went as far as the Jordan <span id="add-2KI.7.15" class="usx-add">River</span>.

Then many of the people of Samaria also went <span id="add-2KI.7.16" class="usx-add">out of the city and went</span> to where the army of Syria had previously set up their tents.

The king of Israel had appointed the officer who was his assistant to supervise what was happening at the marketplace.

After Elisha caused the son of the woman from Shunem <span id="add-2KI.8.1" class="usx-add">town</span> to become alive again, he told her that she should leave with her family and live somewhere else for a while, because Yahweh was going to ◄send a famine/cause food to become very scarce► in the land.

After Ahab’s son Joram has been ruling in Israel for almost twelve years, Jehoram’s son Ahaziah became the king of Judah. <a href="#2KI.8.26"><sup id="2KI.8.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he started to rule. He ruled in Jerusalem for <span id="add-2KI.8.26" class="usx-add">only</span> one year.

King Ahab conducted his life just like the members of Ahab’s family had done. He did things that Yahweh considered to be very evil.</p>

    <a href="#2KI.8.28"><sup id="2KI.8.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
Ahaziah’s army joined the army of King Joram of Israel to fight against the army of King Hazael of Syria.

King Joram returned to Jezreel <span id="add-2KI.8.29" class="usx-add">city</span> to recover from his wounds. King Ahaziah went to visit him there.</p>

Meanwhile, the prophet Elisha summoned one of the other prophets.

When you arrive there, search for a man named Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat and grandson of Nimshi. Go with him into a room away from his companions, <a href="#2KI.9.3"><sup id="2KI.9.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>

<p id="p-2KI.9.3" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2KI.9.4"><sup id="2KI.9.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
So the young prophet went to Ramoth. <a href="#2KI.9.5"><sup id="2KI.9.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
When he arrived, he saw that the commanders of the army were having a conference. He <span id="add-2KI.9.5" class="usx-add">looked at Jehu and</span> said, “Sir, I have a message for <span id="add-2KI.9.5" class="usx-add">one of</span> you.”</p>
<p id="p-2KI.9.5" class="usx-p" >Jehu replied, “Which one of us is the message for?”</p>
<p id="p-2KI.9.5" class="usx-p" >The young prophet replied, “It is for you, commander/sir.”</p>

So Jehu got up and went with the young prophet into a house. There the young prophet poured some <span id="add-2KI.9.6" class="usx-add">olive</span> oil on Jehu’s head and said to him, “Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis <span id="add-2KI.9.6" class="usx-add">worship</span>, declares this: ‘I am appointing you to be the king of my Israeli people. <a href="#2KI.9.7"><sup id="2KI.9.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>

When Jehu came out of the room to where his other commanders were, they said to him, “Is everything all right? Why did that mad fellow come to you?”</p>
<p id="p-2KI.9.11" class="usx-p" >He replied, “You know what kinds of things young prophets like him say.”</p>

    <a href="#2KI.9.12"><sup id="2KI.9.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
They said, “You are lying! Tell us what he said!”</p>

    <a href="#2KI.9.13"><sup id="2KI.9.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Then they all spread their cloaks on the steps of the building <span id="add-2KI.9.13" class="usx-add">for Jehu to walk out on</span>, and they blew trumpets and shouted, “Jehu is now the king!”</p>
<p id="s1-2KI.9.13" class="usx-s1" >King Joram of Israel was killed</p>

King Joram and his army had been defending Ramoth against the attacks by the army of the king of Syria. King Joram had returned to Jezreel <span id="add-2KI.9.14-15" class="usx-add">city</span>, to recover from being wounded in the battle against the army of Hazael, the king of Syria. And Jehu made plans to kill Joram. He said to his other commanders, “If helping me is truly what you want, make sure that no one leaves this city to go to warn the people of Jezreel <span id="add-2KI.9.14-15" class="usx-add">about what I am planning to do</span>.” <a href="#2KI.9.16"><sup id="2KI.9.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
Then Jehu and his officers got into their chariots and rode to Jezreel, where Joram was still recovering. And King Ahaziah of Judah was there, visiting Joram.</p>

    <a href="#2KI.9.17"><sup id="2KI.9.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
A guard was standing in the watchtower in Jezreel. He saw Jehu and his men approaching.

<p id="p-2KI.9.17" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2KI.9.18"><sup id="2KI.9.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
So a man rode out to meet Jehu and said to him, “The king wants to know <span id="add-2KI.9.18" class="usx-add">if you are coming to be</span> friendly to us.”</p>
<p id="p-2KI.9.18" class="usx-p" >Jehu replied, “This is not the time for you [RHQ] to be concerned about acting friendly! Turn around and come behind me!”</p>

    <a href="#2KI.9.19"><sup id="2KI.9.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
So King Joram sent another messenger, who asked Jehu the same question. Again Jehu replied, “This is not the time [RHQ] for you to be concerned about acting friendly! Turn around and follow me!”</p>

    <a href="#2KI.9.20"><sup id="2KI.9.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
Then the watchman reported again, “That messenger also reached them, but he is not coming back <span id="add-2KI.9.20" class="usx-add">alone</span>. And <span id="add-2KI.9.20" class="usx-add">the leader of the group must be</span> Jehu, the son of Nimshi, because he is driving <span id="add-2KI.9.20" class="usx-add">his chariot</span> furiously, <span id="add-2KI.9.20" class="usx-add">like Jehu does</span>!”</p>

Joram said <span id="add-2KI.9.21" class="usx-add">to his soldiers</span>, “Get <span id="add-2KI.9.21" class="usx-add">my chariot</span> ready!” So they did that.

Joram cried out, “Ahaziah, they have deceived us! <span id="add-2KI.9.23" class="usx-add">They want to kill us</span>!” So Joram turned his chariot around and tried to flee.</p>

Then Jehu <span id="add-2KI.10.15" class="usx-add">continued to travel toward Samaria</span>. Along the road, he was met by Jonadab, a leader of the Rechab clan. Jehu greeted him and said to him, “Are you as devoted to me [IDM] as I am devoted to you?”</p>
<p id="p-2KI.10.15" class="usx-p" >Jonadab replied, “Yes, I am.”</p>
<p id="p-2KI.10.15" class="usx-p" >Jehu said, “If you are, shake hands with me.” So Jonadab shook hands with him, and Jehu helped him to get into his chariot. <a href="#2KI.10.16"><sup id="2KI.10.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
Jehu said to him, “Come with me, and you will see that I am very devoted to Yahweh.” So they rode together to Samaria.</p>

    <a href="#2KI.10.17"><sup id="2KI.10.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
When they arrived in Samaria, Jehu killed all of Ahab’s relatives who were still alive. He did not ◄spare any of them/allow any of them to remain alive►. That was what Yahweh told Elijah would happen.</p>
<p id="s1-2KI.10.17" class="usx-s1" >The people who worshiped Baal were killed</p>

    <a href="#2KI.10.18"><sup id="2KI.10.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
Then Jehu summoned all the people <span id="add-2KI.10.18" class="usx-add">of Samaria</span>, and said to them, “King Ahab was devoted to <span id="add-2KI.10.18" class="usx-add">your god</span> Baal a little bit, but I will serve him much more. <a href="#2KI.10.19"><sup id="2KI.10.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
So now summon all the prophets of Baal, all of Baal’s priests, and all the others who worship Baal. I am going to make a great sacrifice to Baal. I want all of them to be there. Any of them who is not there will be executed.” But Jehu was planning to trick them; he was planning to kill all those who worshiped Baal.</p>
<p id="p-2KI.10.19" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2KI.10.20"><sup id="2KI.10.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
Then Jehu commanded, “Announce that we are going to set aside a day to honor Baal.” So they did that. <a href="#2KI.10.21"><sup id="2KI.10.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
Jehu <span id="add-2KI.10.21" class="usx-add">decided what day they would gather and</span> sent messages throughout Israel <span id="add-2KI.10.21" class="usx-add">telling everyone what day to gather on</span>, and on that day, everyone who worshiped Baal came. No one stayed at home. They all went into the huge temple of Baal and filled it from one end to the other. <a href="#2KI.10.22"><sup id="2KI.10.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
Jehu told the priest who took care of the sacred robes to bring them out and give them to the people who worshiped Baal. So the priest did that.</p>
<p id="p-2KI.10.22" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2KI.10.23"><sup id="2KI.10.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
Then Jehu went into the temple of Baal with Jonadab, and he said to the people who were there to worship Baal, “Be sure that only those who worship Baal are here. Be sure that no one who worships Yahweh has come in.” <a href="#2KI.10.24"><sup id="2KI.10.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
Then he and Jonadab prepared to offer sacrifices and other offerings to Baal that would be completely burned <span id="add-2KI.10.24" class="usx-add">on the altar that was there in Samaria</span>. But Jehu had stationed eighty of his men outside the temple, and had said to them, “I want you to kill all the people <span id="add-2KI.10.24" class="usx-add">who are in the temple</span>. Anyone who allows one of them to escape will be executed!”</p>

    <a href="#2KI.10.25"><sup id="2KI.10.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
As soon as Jehu <span id="add-2KI.10.25" class="usx-add">and Jonadab</span> had finished killing the animals that would be completely burned to be an offering to Baal, they <span id="add-2KI.10.25" class="usx-add">went outside and</span> said to the guards and officers, “Go in and kill all of them! Do not allow any of them to escape!” So the guards and officers went in and killed them all with their swords. Then they dragged their corpses outside the temple. Then they went into the inner room of the temple, <a href="#2KI.10.26"><sup id="2KI.10.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
and they carried out the sacred pillar of Baal that was there, and they burned it. <a href="#2KI.10.27"><sup id="2KI.10.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
So they destroyed that pillar that honored Baal, and then they burned down the temple, and made it a public toilet. And it is still a toilet!</p>

    <a href="#2KI.10.28"><sup id="2KI.10.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
That is how Jehu got rid of the worship of Baal in Israel. <a href="#2KI.10.29"><sup id="2KI.10.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>
But Jehu did not quit committing the kinds of sins that Jeroboam had committed, sins that led the people of Israel to sin by worshiping the gold <span id="add-2KI.10.29" class="usx-add">statues of</span> calves in Bethel and Dan <span id="add-2KI.10.29" class="usx-add">cities</span>.</p>

    <a href="#2KI.10.30"><sup id="2KI.10.30" class="usx-v">30</sup></a>
Then Yahweh said to Jehu, “You have done what pleased me by getting rid of all of Ahab’s descendants. So I promise you that your son and grandson and great-grandson and great-great-grandson will all be kings of Israel.” <a href="#2KI.10.31"><sup id="2KI.10.31" class="usx-v">31</sup></a>
But Jehu did not obey all the laws of Yahweh, the God of the Israeli people. He did not stop committing the sins that Jeroboam had committed, sins that led the Israeli people to sin.</p>

At that time, Yahweh began to cause the territory controlled by Israel to become smaller. <span id="add-2KI.10.32" class="usx-add">The army of</span> King Hazael <span id="add-2KI.10.32" class="usx-add">of Syria</span> conquered much of the Israeli territory. <a href="#2KI.10.33"><sup id="2KI.10.33" class="usx-v">33</sup></a>

When King Ahaziah’s mother Athaliah saw that her son had been killed, she commanded that all the members of Ahaziah’s family <span id="add-2KI.11.1" class="usx-add">who might become king</span> must be executed. <a href="#2KI.11.2"><sup id="2KI.11.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
So Ahaziah’s sons were all about to be murdered.

But during the next year, Jehoiada the Supreme Priest summoned the officers who supervised the royal bodyguards and the palace guards. He told them to come to the temple.

He gave them these instructions: “There are three groups of you guards.

You must stand around the king wherever he goes, with your weapons in your hands. You must kill anyone who comes near you.”</p>

The officers <span id="add-2KI.11.9" class="usx-add">who supervised the guards</span> did what Jehoiada told them to do.

The priest distributed to the commanders of the guards the spears and shields that had belonged to King David, that were kept/stored in the temple. <a href="#2KI.11.11"><sup id="2KI.11.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
Then he commanded all the guards to stand in their positions, each one with his sword in his hand, all around the young king.</p>

    <a href="#2KI.11.12"><sup id="2KI.11.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
Then he brought Joash out. He put the crown on his head and gave him a scroll on which were written the rules <span id="add-2KI.11.12" class="usx-add">that the kings needed to obey</span>. Then he poured some olive oil on Joash’s head and proclaimed that he was now the king. The people all clapped their hands and shouted, “We desire/hope that the king will live for many years!”</p>

When Athaliah heard the noise that was being made by the guards and the other people, she ran to the temple, where the people were gathered. <a href="#2KI.11.14"><sup id="2KI.11.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
She saw the new king standing there alongside one of the big pillars, which was the place at the temple where the kings usually stood.

Jehoiada <span id="add-2KI.11.15" class="usx-add">immediately</span> said, “Kill her, but do not kill her here at the temple of Yahweh! Take her away between two rows of guards. And kill anyone who tries to rescue her!” <a href="#2KI.11.16"><sup id="2KI.11.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>

Then Jehoiada made a solemn agreement between the king and the people, that they would always ◄obey/be faithful to► Yahweh. He also made an agreement requiring the people to be loyal to Joash their king. <a href="#2KI.11.18"><sup id="2KI.11.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
Then all the people of Israel who were there went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and the statues of Baal. They also killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, in front of the altars.</p>

Then he and the officers of the temple, the officers who supervised the royal bodyguards, and the king’s bodyguards brought the king from the temple to the palace.

When Jehu had been ruling Israel for almost seven years, Joash became the king of Judah. He ruled in Jerusalem for 40 years. His mother was Zibiah, from Beersheba <span id="add-2KI.12.1" class="usx-add">city</span>. <a href="#2KI.12.2"><sup id="2KI.12.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>

But the places where the people worshiped <span id="add-2KI.12.3" class="usx-add">Yahweh</span> on the tops of hills were not destroyed, and they continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense at those places, <span id="add-2KI.12.3" class="usx-add">instead of at the place that God had chosen for them in Jerusalem</span>.</p>

Joash said to the priests, “You must take all the money which the people contribute, both the money they are required to give and the money that they themselves decide to give, as sacred offerings to buy things for the temple. <a href="#2KI.12.5"><sup id="2KI.12.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
Each priest must take the money from people who know him (OR, from one of the treasurers), and he must use that money to repair the temple whenever he sees that there is something that needs to be repaired.”</p>

    <a href="#2KI.12.6"><sup id="2KI.12.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
But after Joash had been ruling for almost twenty-three years, the priests still had not repaired anything in the temple. <a href="#2KI.12.7"><sup id="2KI.12.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
So Joash summoned Jehoiada and the other priests and said to them, “◄Why are you not repairing things in the temple?/You should have been repairing things in the temple!► [RHQ] From now on, you must not keep the money that you receive from people who know you (OR, the treasurers). You must give it to the people who will be repairing things in the temple!” <a href="#2KI.12.8"><sup id="2KI.12.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
The priests agreed to do that, and they also agreed that they themselves would not do the repair work.</p>

    <a href="#2KI.12.9"><sup id="2KI.12.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
Then Jehoiada took a chest and bored a hole in the lid. He placed it alongside the altar <span id="add-2KI.12.9" class="usx-add">for burning incense/sacrifices</span> that was on the right as anyone enters the temple. The priests who guarded the entrance to the temple put in the box the money that was brought to the temple. <a href="#2KI.12.10"><sup id="2KI.12.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
Whenever they saw that there was a lot of money in the chest, the king’s secretary and the Supreme Priest would come and count the money. Then they would put it in bags and tie the bags shut. <a href="#2KI.12.11"><sup id="2KI.12.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
Then, after they weighed it, they would give the money to the men who supervised the work in the temple. Then the supervisors would use that money to pay the carpenters and builders who did the repair work in the temple, <a href="#2KI.12.12"><sup id="2KI.12.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
and the masons and the stone cutters. Also with some of that money they bought timber and stones that had been cut to be used in the repair work, and to pay all the other expenses for the repair work. <a href="#2KI.12.13"><sup id="2KI.12.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
But they did not use any of that money <span id="add-2KI.12.13" class="usx-add">to pay men</span> to make silver cups or wick trimmers or bowls or trumpets or any other items made of silver or gold to be used in the temple.</p>

The men who supervised the work always did things honestly, so the king’s secretary and the Supreme Priest never required that the supervisors report what they had spent the money for. <a href="#2KI.12.16"><sup id="2KI.12.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
But the money that people gave to pay for the wrong things that they had done and the money they gave to purify themselves because of the sins that they had committed was not put in the chest. That money belonged to the priests.</p>

When King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet King Tiglath-Pileser, he saw the altar that was there.

The old bronze altar which had been dedicated long ago to Yahweh was between the new altar and the temple, so Ahaz moved it to the north side of his new altar, <span id="add-2KI.16.14" class="usx-add">which was bigger than the old altar</span>.</p>

    <a href="#2KI.16.15"><sup id="2KI.16.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
Then King Ahaz ordered Uriah: “Each morning put on this new altar the sacrifices that will be completely burned, and in the evening put on it the grain offering, along with my offering and the offerings that the people bring, ones that will be completely burned, and my grain offering and the people’s grain and wine offerings. Pour against the sides of the altar the blood of all the animals that are sacrificed.

Yahweh warned them many times that they should not worship idols, but they did it anyway. <a href="#2KI.17.13"><sup id="2KI.17.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Yahweh frequently sent his prophets and ◄seers/those who saw visions from Yahweh► to warn the people of Israel and the people of Judah.

So Yahweh rejected all the people of Israel and of Judah. He punished them by allowing the armies of other nations to defeat them <span id="add-2KI.17.20" class="usx-add">and take them away</span>. He got rid of all of them.</p>

Earlier, when Yahweh allowed the people of Israel to separate/break away from the area [MTY] that King David <span id="add-2KI.17.21" class="usx-add">had estabished</span>, they chose Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, to be their king. Then Jeroboam enticed the people of Israel to stop worshiping Yahweh <span id="add-2KI.17.21" class="usx-add">and to worship idols instead</span>. He led them to commit great sins. <a href="#2KI.17.22"><sup id="2KI.17.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
And the Israeli people continued to do the evil things that Jeroboam introduced. They did not turn away from those sins, <a href="#2KI.17.23"><sup id="2KI.17.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>

Then those people sent a message to the king of Assyria. They wrote, “We people who have resettled in the towns in Samaria do not know how to worship the God <span id="add-2KI.17.26" class="usx-add">that the Israelis worshiped</span> in this land.

He destroyed the places where people worshiped Yahweh on the tops of hills, and he broke into pieces the stone pillars <span id="add-2KI.18.4" class="usx-add">for worshiping the goddess Asherah</span>.

Yahweh always ◄helped/was with► him. He was successful in everything that he did. He rebelled against the king of Assyria and refused to ◄pay taxes to him/do what the king of Assyria wanted him to do►. <a href="#2KI.18.8"><sup id="2KI.18.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>

He also commanded that the altars that King Solomon had built east of Jerusalem, south of Olive Tree Hill, be desecrated.

In every city in Israel, at Josiah’s command, they tore down the shrines that had been built by the previous kings of Israel, which had caused Yahweh to become very angry.

He also removed from Jerusalem and from the other places in Judah all the household idols and all the other idols and abominable things.

The soldiers also took away the ◄firepans/trays for carrying burning coals►, the basins, and <span id="add-2KI.25.15" class="usx-add">all the other</span> items made of pure gold or pure silver.</p>

    <a href="#2KI.25.16"><sup id="2KI.25.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
The bronze from the two pillars, the carts with wheels, and the huge basin were very heavy; they could not be weighed. ◄Those things had been made/A man named Hiram had made these things► for the temple when Solomon <span id="add-2KI.25.16" class="usx-add">was the king of Israel</span>. <a href="#2KI.25.17"><sup id="2KI.25.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
Each of the pillars was ◄27 feet/8 meters► tall. The bronze capital/top of each pillar was ◄7-1/2 feet/2.3 meters► high. They were each decorated all around with something that looked like a net made of bronze chains connecting bronze pomegranates.</p>

    <a href="#2KI.25.18"><sup id="2KI.25.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
Nebuzaradan took with him to Babylon Seraiah the Supreme Priest, Zephaniah his assistant, and the three men who guarded the entrance <span id="add-2KI.25.18" class="usx-add">to the temple</span>. <a href="#2KI.25.19"><sup id="2KI.25.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
And they found people who were still hiding in Jerusalem. From those people he took one officer from the Judean army, five of the king’s advisors, the chief secretary of the army commander who was in charge of recruiting men to join the army, and 60 other important Judean men. <a href="#2KI.25.20"><sup id="2KI.25.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
Nebuzaradan took them all to the king of Babylon at Riblah <span id="add-2KI.25.20" class="usx-add">city</span>. <a href="#2KI.25.21"><sup id="2KI.25.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
There at Riblah, in Hamath province, the king of Babylon commanded that they all be executed.</p>
<p id="p-2KI.25.21" class="usx-p" >That is what happened when the people of Judah were ◄taken forcefully/exiled► from their land <span id="add-2KI.25.21" class="usx-add">to Babylon</span>.</p>
<p id="s1-2KI.25.21" class="usx-s1" >Gedaliah was appointed governor in Judah</p>

    <a href="#2KI.25.22"><sup id="2KI.25.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
Then King Nebuchadnezzar appointed Gedaliah, who was the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, to be the governor of the people who were still living in Judah. <a href="#2KI.25.23"><sup id="2KI.25.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
When all the army captains of Judah and their soldiers who had not surrendered to Nebuchadnezzar found out that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah to be the governor, they met with him at Mizpah <span id="add-2KI.25.23" class="usx-add">town</span>. These army captains were Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan the son of Kareah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth from Netophah <span id="add-2KI.25.23" class="usx-add">town</span>, and Jaazaniah from the Maacah region.</p>
<p id="p-2KI.25.23" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2KI.25.24"><sup id="2KI.25.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
Gedaliah solemnly promised them <span id="add-2KI.25.24" class="usx-add">that the officials from Babylon were not planning to harm them</span>. He said, “You may live in this land <span id="add-2KI.25.24" class="usx-add">without being afraid</span> and serve the king of Babylon, and <span id="add-2KI.25.24" class="usx-add">if you do</span>, everything will go well for you.”</p>
<p id="p-2KI.25.24" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2KI.25.25"><sup id="2KI.25.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
But in October of that year, Ishmael, whose grandfather Elishama was one of the relatives of the descendants of King David, went to Mizpah along with ten other men and assassinated/killed Gedaliah and all the men who were with him. There were also men from Judah and men from Babylon whom they assassinated. <a href="#2KI.25.26"><sup id="2KI.25.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
Then many [HYP] of the people from Judah, important people and unimportant ones, and the army captains, were very afraid of <span id="add-2KI.25.26" class="usx-add">what</span> the Babylonians <span id="add-2KI.25.26" class="usx-add">would do to them</span>, so they fled to Egypt.</p>
<p id="s1-2KI.25.26" class="usx-s1" >Jehoiachin was released</p>
<p id="p-2KI.25.26" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2KI.25.27"><sup id="2KI.25.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
Thirty-seven years after King Jehoiachin of Judah was taken to Babylon, <span id="add-2KI.25.27" class="usx-add">Nebuchadnezzar’s son</span> Evil-Merodach became the king of Babylon. He was kind to Jehoiachin, and on April 2 of that year, he released/freed Jehoiachin from prison. <a href="#2KI.25.28"><sup id="2KI.25.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
He always spoke kindly to Jehoiachin and honored him more than the other kings who had been taken/exiled to Babylon. <a href="#2KI.25.29"><sup id="2KI.25.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>
He gave Jehoiachin new clothes to replace the clothes that he had been wearing in prison, and he allowed Jehoiachin to eat at the king’s table every day for the rest of his life. <a href="#2KI.25.30"><sup id="2KI.25.30" class="usx-v">30</sup></a>
The king of Babylon also gave him money every day, so that he could buy the things that he needed. The king continued to do that until Jehoiachin died.</p>
