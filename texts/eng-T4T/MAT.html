This is <span id="add-MAT.1.18" class="usx-add">the account of what happened just before</span> Jesus Christ was born. Mary, his mother, {had publicly promised Joseph that she would marry him} had been publicly promised to marry Joseph. Before they began to sleep together, <span id="add-MAT.1.18" class="usx-add">Mary</span> realized that she was pregnant. <span id="add-MAT.1.18" class="usx-add">It was the power of</span> the Holy Spirit that had caused her to become pregnant. <a href="#MAT.1.19"><sup id="MAT.1.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
Joseph, her <span id="add-MAT.1.19" class="usx-add">future</span> husband, was a man who obeyed God’s commands. <span id="add-MAT.1.19" class="usx-add">One of those commands was that men must divorce women who had acted immorally. So when Joseph learned that Mary was pregnant, he assumed that she was pregnant as a result of her acting immorally</span>. So he decided to break the engagement. But because he did not want to shame her publicly, he decided to do it privately. <a href="#MAT.1.20"><sup id="MAT.1.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
While he was seriously considering this, much to his surprise, in a dream he saw an angel whom the Lord <span id="add-MAT.1.20" class="usx-add">had sent</span>. The angel said, “Joseph, descendant of <span id="add-MAT.1.20" class="usx-add">King</span> David, do not be afraid that <span id="add-MAT.1.20" class="usx-add">you(sg) would be doing wrong if you(sg) would marry</span> Mary. Instead, <span id="add-MAT.1.20" class="usx-add">begin to treat her</span> as your wife, because the Holy Spirit, <span id="add-MAT.1.20" class="usx-add">not a man</span>, has caused her to be pregnant. <a href="#MAT.1.21"><sup id="MAT.1.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
She will give birth to a son. Since it is he who will cause that his people will be saved from <span id="add-MAT.1.21" class="usx-add">the guilt of</span> their having sinned, name <span id="add-MAT.1.21" class="usx-add">the baby</span> Jesus, <span id="add-MAT.1.21" class="usx-add">which means ‘the Lord saves people’</span>.” <a href="#MAT.1.22"><sup id="MAT.1.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
All this happened as a result of what the Lord told the prophet <span id="add-MAT.1.22" class="usx-add">Isaiah to write long ago about what was going to happen</span>. This is what Isaiah wrote: <a href="#MAT.1.23"><sup id="MAT.1.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
“Listen, a virgin will become pregnant and will give birth to a son. They will call him Emmanuel.” Emmanuel means ‘God is with us’. <a href="#MAT.1.24"><sup id="MAT.1.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
When Joseph got up from sleep, he did what the angel whom the Lord <span id="add-MAT.1.24" class="usx-add">had sent</span> commanded him to do. He took <span id="add-MAT.1.24" class="usx-add">Mary</span> home to be his wife. <a href="#MAT.1.25"><sup id="MAT.1.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>

Herod wanted to have John executed, but he was afraid that the people <span id="add-MAT.14.5" class="usx-add">who had accepted what John taught would riot if he did that</span>, because they believed that John was a prophet.</p>

When it was time to harvest the grapes, the landowner sent some of his servants to the men who were taking care of the vineyard to get his share of the grapes <span id="add-MAT.21.34" class="usx-add">that the vineyard had produced</span>. <a href="#MAT.21.35"><sup id="MAT.21.35" class="usx-v">35</sup></a>

    <a href="#MAT.27.45"><sup id="MAT.27.45" class="usx-v">45</sup></a>
At noon it became dark over the whole land. <span id="add-MAT.27.45" class="usx-add">It stayed dark</span> until three o’clock <span id="add-MAT.27.45" class="usx-add">in the afternoon</span>. <a href="#MAT.27.46"><sup id="MAT.27.46" class="usx-v">46</sup></a>
At about three o’clock Jesus shouted loudly, “Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?” That means, ‘My God, my God, why have you deserted me?’ <a href="#MAT.27.47"><sup id="MAT.27.47" class="usx-v">47</sup></a>
When some of the people standing there heard <span id="add-MAT.27.47" class="usx-add">the word ‘Eli’, misunderstanding it</span>, they said, “He is calling for <span id="add-MAT.27.47" class="usx-add">the prophet</span> Elijah!” <a href="#MAT.27.48"><sup id="MAT.27.48" class="usx-v">48</sup></a>
Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with sour wine. Then he put the sponge on <span id="add-MAT.27.48" class="usx-add">the tip of</span> a reed and <span id="add-MAT.27.48" class="usx-add">held it up in order that Jesus</span> could suck out <span id="add-MAT.27.48" class="usx-add">the wine that was in it</span>. <a href="#MAT.27.49"><sup id="MAT.27.49" class="usx-v">49</sup></a>
But the other <span id="add-MAT.27.49" class="usx-add">people there</span> said, “Wait! Let’s see if Elijah comes to save him!” <a href="#MAT.27.50"><sup id="MAT.27.50" class="usx-v">50</sup></a>
Then after Jesus shouted out loudly again, he died, giving his spirit over <span id="add-MAT.27.50" class="usx-add">to God</span>. <a href="#MAT.27.51"><sup id="MAT.27.51" class="usx-v">51</sup></a>
At that moment the <span id="add-MAT.27.51" class="usx-add">heavy thick</span> curtain <span id="add-MAT.27.51" class="usx-add">that closed off the most holy place</span> in the Temple split into two pieces from top to bottom. <span id="add-MAT.27.51" class="usx-add">That signified that ordinary people could now go into the presence of God</span>. The earth shook, and <span id="add-MAT.27.51" class="usx-add">some large</span> rocks split open. <a href="#MAT.27.52"><sup id="MAT.27.52" class="usx-v">52</sup></a>
<span id="add-MAT.27.52" class="usx-add">Some</span> tombs opened up, and the bodies of many godly people who had died became alive again. <a href="#MAT.27.53"><sup id="MAT.27.53" class="usx-v">53</sup></a>
They came out of the tombs, and after Jesus became alive again, they went into Jerusalem and appeared to many people <span id="add-MAT.27.53" class="usx-add">there</span>.</p>
<p id="p-MAT.27.53" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#MAT.27.54"><sup id="MAT.27.54" class="usx-v">54</sup></a>
The officer who supervised the soldiers <span id="add-MAT.27.54" class="usx-add">who nailed Jesus to the cross was standing nearby</span>. His soldiers who had been on guard <span id="add-MAT.27.54" class="usx-add">so that no one would rescue</span> Jesus <span id="add-MAT.27.54" class="usx-add">were also there</span>. When they <span id="add-MAT.27.54" class="usx-add">felt</span> the earthquake and saw all the <span id="add-MAT.27.54" class="usx-add">other</span> things that happened, they were terrified. They exclaimed, “Truly he was both man and God! (OR, a Son of God).”</p>
<p id="p-MAT.27.54" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#MAT.27.55"><sup id="MAT.27.55" class="usx-v">55</sup></a>
Many women were there, watching from a distance. They were women who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee <span id="add-MAT.27.55" class="usx-add">district</span> in order to provide the things he needed. <a href="#MAT.27.56"><sup id="MAT.27.56" class="usx-v">56</sup></a>
Among these women were Mary from Magdala <span id="add-MAT.27.56" class="usx-add">town</span>, <span id="add-MAT.27.56" class="usx-add">another</span> Mary who was the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of James and John.</p>
<p id="s1-MAT.27.56" class="usx-s1" >Jesus was buried.</p>
<p id="sr-MAT.27.56" class="usx-sr" >

<p id="p-MAT.27.56" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#MAT.27.57"><sup id="MAT.27.57" class="usx-v">57</sup></a>
When it was <span id="add-MAT.27.57" class="usx-add">almost</span> evening, a rich man named Joseph came <span id="add-MAT.27.57" class="usx-add">there</span>. He was from Arimathea <span id="add-MAT.27.57" class="usx-add">town</span>. He also was a disciple of Jesus. <a href="#MAT.27.58"><sup id="MAT.27.58" class="usx-v">58</sup></a>
He then went to Pilate and asked Pilate to <span id="add-MAT.27.58" class="usx-add">allow him to take</span> the body of Jesus <span id="add-MAT.27.58" class="usx-add">and bury it</span>. Pilate ordered that <span id="add-MAT.27.58" class="usx-add">he</span> be allowed to {<span id="add-MAT.27.58" class="usx-add">his soldiers</span> let <span id="add-MAT.27.58" class="usx-add">Joseph</span>} take <span id="add-MAT.27.58" class="usx-add">the body</span>. <a href="#MAT.27.59"><sup id="MAT.27.59" class="usx-v">59</sup></a>
So Joseph <span id="add-MAT.27.59" class="usx-add">and others</span> took the body and wrapped it in a clean white cloth. <a href="#MAT.27.60"><sup id="MAT.27.60" class="usx-v">60</sup></a>
Then they placed it in Joseph’s own new tomb that had been dug out of the rock <span id="add-MAT.27.60" class="usx-add">cliff</span>. They rolled a huge <span id="add-MAT.27.60" class="usx-add">circular flat</span> stone in front of the entrance to the tomb. Then they left. <a href="#MAT.27.61"><sup id="MAT.27.61" class="usx-v">61</sup></a>
Mary from Magdala and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb, <span id="add-MAT.27.61" class="usx-add">watching</span>.</p>
<p id="s1-MAT.27.61" class="usx-s1" >The religious leaders arranged for Jesus’ tomb to be sealed and guarded.</p>

    <a href="#MAT.27.62"><sup id="MAT.27.62" class="usx-v">62</sup></a>
The next day was Saturday, the Jewish day of rest. The chief priests and <span id="add-MAT.27.62" class="usx-add">some of</span> the Pharisees went to Pilate. <a href="#MAT.27.63"><sup id="MAT.27.63" class="usx-v">63</sup></a>
They said, “Sir, we remember that while that deceiver was still alive, he said, ‘Three days after I <span id="add-MAT.27.63" class="usx-add">die I</span> will become alive again.’ <a href="#MAT.27.64"><sup id="MAT.27.64" class="usx-v">64</sup></a>
So we ask you to order that the tomb be guarded {that <span id="add-MAT.27.64" class="usx-add">soldiers</span> guard the tomb} for three days. If you do not do that, his disciples may come and steal the body. Then they will tell people that he has risen from the dead. If they deceive <span id="add-MAT.27.64" class="usx-add">people by saying that</span>, it will be worse than the way he deceived people before <span id="add-MAT.27.64" class="usx-add">by saying that he was the Messiah</span>.” <a href="#MAT.27.65"><sup id="MAT.27.65" class="usx-v">65</sup></a>
Pilate replied, “You <span id="add-MAT.27.65" class="usx-add">can</span> take some soldiers. Go to the tomb and make it as secure as you know how.” <a href="#MAT.27.66"><sup id="MAT.27.66" class="usx-v">66</sup></a>
So they went and made the tomb secure by <span id="add-MAT.27.66" class="usx-add">fastening a cord from</span> the stone <span id="add-MAT.27.66" class="usx-add">that was in front of the entrance to the rock cliff on each side</span> and sealing it. They also <span id="add-MAT.27.66" class="usx-add">left some soldiers there to</span> guard <span id="add-MAT.27.66" class="usx-add">the tomb</span>.</p>

After ◄the Sabbath/the Jewish day of rest► <span id="add-MAT.28.1" class="usx-add">ended</span>, on Sunday morning at dawn, Mary from Magdala and the other Mary went to look at the tomb. <a href="#MAT.28.2"><sup id="MAT.28.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
Suddenly there was a strong earthquake. <span id="add-MAT.28.2" class="usx-add">At the same time</span> an angel from God came down from heaven. He <span id="add-MAT.28.2" class="usx-add">went to the tomb and</span> rolled the stone away <span id="add-MAT.28.2" class="usx-add">from the entrance so that everyone could see that the tomb was empty</span>. Then he sat on the stone. <a href="#MAT.28.3"><sup id="MAT.28.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
His appearance was <span id="add-MAT.28.3" class="usx-add">as bright</span> [SIM] as lightning, and his clothes were as white as snow. <a href="#MAT.28.4"><sup id="MAT.28.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
The guards shook because they were very afraid. Then they became <span id="add-MAT.28.4" class="usx-add">completely motionless</span>, as though they were dead.</p>
<p id="p-MAT.28.4" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#MAT.28.5"><sup id="MAT.28.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
The angel said to the two women, “You should not be afraid! I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was {whom they} ◄nailed to a cross/crucified►. <a href="#MAT.28.6"><sup id="MAT.28.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
He is not here! <span id="add-MAT.28.6" class="usx-add">God</span> has ◄caused him to be alive again/raised him <span id="add-MAT.28.6" class="usx-add">from the dead</span>►, just like <span id="add-MAT.28.6" class="usx-add">Jesus</span> told you <span id="add-MAT.28.6" class="usx-add">would happen!</span> Come and see the place where his body lay! <a href="#MAT.28.7"><sup id="MAT.28.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Then go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead! He will go ahead of you to Galilee <span id="add-MAT.28.7" class="usx-add">district</span>. You will see him there.’ <span id="add-MAT.28.7" class="usx-add">Pay attention to what</span> I have told you!”</p>
<p id="p-MAT.28.7" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#MAT.28.8"><sup id="MAT.28.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
So the women left the tomb quickly. They were afraid, but they were <span id="add-MAT.28.8" class="usx-add">also</span> very joyful. They ran to tell us disciples <span id="add-MAT.28.8" class="usx-add">what had happened</span>. <a href="#MAT.28.9"><sup id="MAT.28.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
Suddenly, <span id="add-MAT.28.9" class="usx-add">as they were running</span>, Jesus appeared to them. He said, “Greetings!” The women came close to him. They knelt down and clasped his feet and worshipped him. <a href="#MAT.28.10"><sup id="MAT.28.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid! Go and tell ◄all my disciples/all those who have been accompanying me► that they should go to Galilee. They will see me there.”</p>

While the women were going, some of the soldiers who had been guarding <span id="add-MAT.28.11" class="usx-add">the tomb</span> went into the city. They reported to the chief priests everything that had happened. <a href="#MAT.28.12"><sup id="MAT.28.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
So the chief priests and Jewish elders met together. They made a plan <span id="add-MAT.28.12" class="usx-add">to explain why the tomb was empty</span>. They gave the soldiers a lot of money <span id="add-MAT.28.12" class="usx-add">as a bribe</span>. <a href="#MAT.28.13"><sup id="MAT.28.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
They said, “Tell people, ‘His disciples came during the night and stole his <span id="add-MAT.28.13" class="usx-add">body</span> while we were sleeping.’ <a href="#MAT.28.14"><sup id="MAT.28.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
If the governor hears [MTY] about this, we ourselves will make sure that he does not get angry <span id="add-MAT.28.14" class="usx-add">and punish you</span>. <span id="add-MAT.28.14" class="usx-add">So you will not have to worry</span>.” <a href="#MAT.28.15"><sup id="MAT.28.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told {as <span id="add-MAT.28.15" class="usx-add">the chief priests and elders</span> told them}. And this story has been told {People have told this story} among the Jews to the very day <span id="add-MAT.28.15" class="usx-add">that I am writing</span> this.</p>

    <span id="add-MAT.28.16" class="usx-add">Later we</span> eleven <span id="add-MAT.28.16" class="usx-add">disciples</span> went to Galilee <span id="add-MAT.28.16" class="usx-add">district</span>.

We saw him <span id="add-MAT.28.17" class="usx-add">there</span> and worshipped him.

Then Jesus came <span id="add-MAT.28.18" class="usx-add">close</span> to <span id="add-MAT.28.18" class="usx-add">us</span> and said, “<span id="add-MAT.28.18" class="usx-add">My Father</span> has given me all authority over everything and everyone in heaven and on earth. <a href="#MAT.28.19"><sup id="MAT.28.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
