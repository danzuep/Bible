This is <span id="add-MAT.1.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the account of what happened just before</span> Jesus Christ was born. Mary, his mother, {had publicly promised Joseph that she would marry him} had been publicly promised to marry Joseph. Before they began to sleep together, <span id="add-MAT.1.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Mary</span> realized that she was pregnant. <span id="add-MAT.1.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">It was the power of</span> the Holy Spirit that had caused her to become pregnant. <a href="#MAT.1.19"><sup id="MAT.1.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
Joseph, her <span id="add-MAT.1.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">future</span> husband, was a man who obeyed God’s commands. <span id="add-MAT.1.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">One of those commands was that men must divorce women who had acted immorally. So when Joseph learned that Mary was pregnant, he assumed that she was pregnant as a result of her acting immorally</span>. So he decided to break the engagement. But because he did not want to shame her publicly, he decided to do it privately. <a href="#MAT.1.20"><sup id="MAT.1.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
While he was seriously considering this, much to his surprise, in a dream he saw an angel whom the Lord <span id="add-MAT.1.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">had sent</span>. The angel said, “Joseph, descendant of <span id="add-MAT.1.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">King</span> David, do not be afraid that <span id="add-MAT.1.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">you(sg) would be doing wrong if you(sg) would marry</span> Mary. Instead, <span id="add-MAT.1.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">begin to treat her</span> as your wife, because the Holy Spirit, <span id="add-MAT.1.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">not a man</span>, has caused her to be pregnant. <a href="#MAT.1.21"><sup id="MAT.1.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
She will give birth to a son.

All this happened as a result of what the Lord told the prophet <span id="add-MAT.1.22" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Isaiah to write long ago about what was going to happen</span>. This is what Isaiah wrote: <a href="#MAT.1.23"><sup id="MAT.1.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
“Listen, a virgin will become pregnant and will give birth to a son. They will call him Emmanuel.” Emmanuel means ‘God is with us’. <a href="#MAT.1.24"><sup id="MAT.1.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
When Joseph got up from sleep, he did what the angel whom the Lord <span id="add-MAT.1.24" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">had sent</span> commanded him to do. He took <span id="add-MAT.1.24" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Mary</span> home to be his wife. <a href="#MAT.1.25"><sup id="MAT.1.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
But he did not have sexual relations with her until she had given birth to a son. And <span id="add-MAT.1.25" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Joseph</span> named him Jesus.</p>

Finally two men came forward <a href="#MAT.26.61"><sup id="MAT.26.61" class="usx-v">61</sup></a>
and said, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy God’s Temple and to rebuild it within three days.’” <a href="#MAT.26.62"><sup id="MAT.26.62" class="usx-v">62</sup></a>
Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, “Are you not going to reply?

Jesus replied, “Yes, <span id="add-MAT.26.64" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">it is as</span> you say.

You will see him there.’ <span id="add-MAT.28.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Pay attention to what</span> I have told you!”</p>

So the women left the tomb quickly. They were afraid, but they were <span id="add-MAT.28.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">also</span> very joyful. They ran to tell us disciples <span id="add-MAT.28.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">what had happened</span>. <a href="#MAT.28.9"><sup id="MAT.28.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
Suddenly, <span id="add-MAT.28.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">as they were running</span>, Jesus appeared to them. He said, “Greetings!” The women came close to him. They knelt down and clasped his feet and worshipped him. <a href="#MAT.28.10"><sup id="MAT.28.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid! Go and tell ◄all my disciples/all those who have been accompanying me► that they should go to Galilee. They will see me there.”</p>

    <a href="#MAT.28.11"><sup id="MAT.28.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
While the women were going, some of the soldiers who had been guarding <span id="add-MAT.28.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the tomb</span> went into the city. They reported to the chief priests everything that had happened. <a href="#MAT.28.12"><sup id="MAT.28.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
So the chief priests and Jewish elders met together. They made a plan <span id="add-MAT.28.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to explain why the tomb was empty</span>. They gave the soldiers a lot of money <span id="add-MAT.28.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">as a bribe</span>. <a href="#MAT.28.13"><sup id="MAT.28.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
They said, “Tell people, ‘His disciples came during the night and stole his <span id="add-MAT.28.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">body</span> while we were sleeping.’ <a href="#MAT.28.14"><sup id="MAT.28.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
If the governor hears [MTY] about this, we ourselves will make sure that he does not get angry <span id="add-MAT.28.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and punish you</span>. <span id="add-MAT.28.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">So you will not have to worry</span>.” <a href="#MAT.28.15"><sup id="MAT.28.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told {as <span id="add-MAT.28.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the chief priests and elders</span> told them}. And this story has been told {People have told this story} among the Jews to the very day <span id="add-MAT.28.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that I am writing</span> this.</p>

    <span id="add-MAT.28.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Later we</span> eleven <span id="add-MAT.28.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">disciples</span> went to Galilee <span id="add-MAT.28.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">district</span>. We went to the mountain where Jesus had told <span id="add-MAT.28.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">us</span> to go. <a href="#MAT.28.17"><sup id="MAT.28.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
We saw him <span id="add-MAT.28.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">there</span> and worshipped him. But some of <span id="add-MAT.28.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">us</span> doubted <span id="add-MAT.28.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that it was really Jesus, and that he had become alive again</span>. <a href="#MAT.28.18"><sup id="MAT.28.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
Then Jesus came <span id="add-MAT.28.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">close</span> to <span id="add-MAT.28.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">us</span> and said, “<span id="add-MAT.28.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">My Father</span> has given me all authority over everything and everyone in heaven and on earth. <a href="#MAT.28.19"><sup id="MAT.28.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
