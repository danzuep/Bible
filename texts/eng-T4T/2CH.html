    <span id="add-2CH.1.2-5" class="usx-add">One day</span> Solomon summoned the army commanders of 1,000 soldiers and the commanders of 100 soldiers and the judges and all the other leaders in Israel.

God replied, “<span id="add-2CH.1.11" class="usx-add">I am pleased with what</span> you desire; you have not requested a huge amount of money or to be honored or that your enemies be killed.

Solomon acquired 1,400 chariots and 12,000 men who rode <span id="add-2CH.1.14" class="usx-add">on horses</span>. He put some of the chariots and horses in Jerusalem, and put some of them in various other cities. <a href="#2CH.1.15"><sup id="2CH.1.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
During the years that Solomon was king, silver and gold were as common in Jerusalem as stones, and <span id="add-2CH.1.15" class="usx-add">lumber from</span> cedar trees were as plentiful as <span id="add-2CH.1.15" class="usx-add">lumber from</span> ordinary sycamore trees in the foothills. <a href="#2CH.1.16"><sup id="2CH.1.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>

After Solomon’s workers had finished building the temple, Solomon put in the temple storage rooms everything that his father David had dedicated to Yahweh—all the silver and gold and all the other things that were used at the temple.</p>

Then King Solomon summoned to Jerusalem all the elders of Israel, all the leaders of the tribes and of the families/clans.

King Solomon and many of the other people of Israel who had gathered there walked in front of the Sacred Chest. And they sacrificed a huge amount of sheep and cattle. No one was able to count them <span id="add-2CH.5.6" class="usx-add">because there were very many</span>.</p>

The wings of those statues spread out over the Sacred Chest and over the poles by which it was carried. <a href="#2CH.5.9"><sup id="2CH.5.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>

The only things that were inside the Sacred Chest were the two stone tablets that Moses had put there at Sinai Mountain, where Yahweh made an agreement with the Israeli people after they came out of Egypt.</p>

All the descendants of Levi who were musicians—Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, their sons and their other relatives—stood on the east side of the altar.

At that time the prophet Hanani went to King Asa and said to him, “Because you relied on the king of Syria and not on Yahweh our God, you missed your opportunity to destroy the army of the king of Syria. <a href="#2CH.16.8"><sup id="2CH.16.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
The huge armies from Ethiopia and Libya with all their chariots and soldiers <span id="add-2CH.16.8" class="usx-add">riding</span> on horses <span id="add-2CH.16.8" class="usx-add">were certainly very powerful.

Asa was very angry with the prophet because of what the prophet had said. So he <span id="add-2CH.16.10" class="usx-add">commanded his officials to</span> put Hanani in prison. At that same time, he started to treat some of his people very cruelly.</p>

When Asa had been ruling for almost 39 years, he was afflicted with a disease in his feet. The disease was very severe, but in spite of that, he did not request help from Yahweh. Instead he sought help only from doctors. <a href="#2CH.16.13"><sup id="2CH.16.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>

Their army invaded Judah and took away <span id="add-2CH.21.17" class="usx-add">from Jerusalem</span> all the valuable things that they found in the king’s palace, and even his sons and wives. His youngest son, Ahaziah, was the only one of his sons whom they did not take away.</p>

The people of Jerusalem appointed Jehoram’s youngest son Ahaziah as their king, because the men <span id="add-2CH.22.1" class="usx-add">from Philistia</span> who had invaded Judah with some Arabs had killed all of Jehoram’s other sons. So Ahaziah started to rule Judah.</p>

Ahaziah was 22 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for one year. His mother’s name was Athaliah, a granddaughter of <span id="add-2CH.22.2" class="usx-add">King</span> Omri <span id="add-2CH.22.2" class="usx-add">of Israel</span>.</p>

He did things that Yahweh considers to be evil, like the descendants of Ahab had done, because after Ahaziah’s father died, they became his advisors. And Ahaziah died as a result of heeding their bad advice. <a href="#2CH.22.5"><sup id="2CH.22.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>

But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Jehoram, took Joash, Ahaziah’s very young son, away from the other sons of the king who were about to be murdered, and she hid him and his nursemaid in a bedroom in the temple. Because Jehosheba, who was the daughter of King Jehoram and the wife of the Supreme Priest Jehoiada, was Ahaziah’s sister, she hid the child, with the result that Athaliah could not kill him. <a href="#2CH.22.12"><sup id="2CH.22.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>

After Joash had been hidden in the temple for six years, Jehoiada the priest decided that it was necessary to do something.

the whole group went to the temple and made an agreement with the young king there. Jehoiada said to them, “This is the son of the previous king of Judah. So he is the one who must rule, like Yahweh promised that the descendants of King David must do.</p>

Only the priests and the descendants of Levi who work there will enter the temple.

    <a href="#2CH.23.8"><sup id="2CH.23.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
So the descendants of Levi and all <span id="add-2CH.23.8" class="usx-add">the men of</span> Judah did what Jehoiada had told them. He did not allow anyone to go home after having finished his work on that Sabbath day.

He commanded all the guards to stand in their positions, each with his sword in his hand, all around the king—around the altar and the temple, from the north side to the south side.</p>

She saw the young king there, standing alongside the pillar at the entrance of the temple, <span id="add-2CH.23.13" class="usx-add">which is the place at the temple</span> where the kings usually stood. The army commanders and trumpet players were standing beside the king, and all the people of Judah were rejoicing and blowing trumpets, and singers with their musical instruments were leading the people while they praised God.

Then Jehoiada made an agreement that he and the king and all the other people would be Yahweh’s people. <a href="#2CH.23.17"><sup id="2CH.23.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
Then all the people who were there went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars <span id="add-2CH.23.17" class="usx-add">of Baal</span>. They also killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, in front of those altars.</p>

Joash was seven years old when he became the king <span id="add-2CH.24.1" class="usx-add">of Judah</span>, and he ruled in Jerusalem for 40 years.

Then the king sent letters everywhere in Judah, requesting everyone to bring their tax money to the temple, like Moses had required the Israeli people to do <span id="add-2CH.24.9" class="usx-add">when they were</span> in the desert. <a href="#2CH.24.10"><sup id="2CH.24.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>

The king and Jehoiada gave the money to the men who were supervising the work of repairing the temple. Those men hired stoneworkers and carpenters to repair the temple.

When they had finished the repair work, they brought to the king and to Jehoiada the money that they had not used for the repairs.

Before the battle ended, Joash was severely wounded.

<a href="#2CH.25"><h3 id="2CH.25" class="usx-c">25</h3></a>
<p id="s1-2CH.25" class="usx-s1" >King Amaziah of Judah</p>
<p id="p-2CH.25" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2CH.25.1"><sup id="2CH.25.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
Amaziah was 25 years old when he became the king <span id="add-2CH.25.1" class="usx-add">of Judah</span>, and he ruled from Jerusalem for 29 years. His mother was Jehoaddin; she was from Jerusalem. <a href="#2CH.25.2"><sup id="2CH.25.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
Amaziah did many things that pleased Yahweh, but he did not do them enthusiastically. <a href="#2CH.25.3"><sup id="2CH.25.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
As soon as he was in complete control of his kingdom, he caused to be executed the officials who had murdered his father. <a href="#2CH.25.4"><sup id="2CH.25.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
But he did not command their sons to be executed; he obeyed what was in the laws that Moses had written. In those laws Yahweh had commanded, “People must not be executed because of <span id="add-2CH.25.4" class="usx-add">what</span> their children <span id="add-2CH.25.4" class="usx-add">have done</span>, and children must not be executed for <span id="add-2CH.25.4" class="usx-add">what</span> their parents <span id="add-2CH.25.4" class="usx-add">have done</span>. People must be executed only for the sins that they themselves have committed.”</p>
<p id="p-2CH.25.4" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2CH.25.5"><sup id="2CH.25.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
Amaziah summoned the men of <span id="add-2CH.25.5" class="usx-add">the tribes of</span> Judah and Benjamin to come to Jerusalem, and there he put them in groups, each clan in a group by themselves. Then he appointed officers to command each group. Some officers commanded 100 men and some commanded 1,000 men. They counted the men who were at least 20 years old; altogether there were 300,000 men. They were all men who were prepared to be in the army, and able to <span id="add-2CH.25.5" class="usx-add">fight well,</span> using spears and shields. <a href="#2CH.25.6"><sup id="2CH.25.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
Amaziah also hired 100,000 capable soldiers from Israel and paid almost four tons of silver for them.</p>
<p id="p-2CH.25.6" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2CH.25.7"><sup id="2CH.25.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
But a prophet came to him and said, “Your majesty, you must not allow those soldiers from Israel to march with your soldiers, because Yahweh does not help the people of the tribe of Ephraim or from <span id="add-2CH.25.7" class="usx-add">anywhere else in</span> Israel. <a href="#2CH.25.8"><sup id="2CH.25.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
Even if your soldiers go and fight courageously in battles, God will cause your enemies to defeat you; do not forget that God has the power to help armies or to cause them to be defeated.”</p>
<p id="p-2CH.25.8" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2CH.25.9"><sup id="2CH.25.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
Amaziah asked that prophet, “If I do that, what about the huge amount of silver that I paid to hire those soldiers from Israel?”</p>
<p id="p-2CH.25.9" class="usx-p" >The prophet replied, “Yahweh is able to pay you back more money than you paid <span id="add-2CH.25.9" class="usx-add">to hire those soldiers</span>.”</p>
<p id="p-2CH.25.9" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2CH.25.10"><sup id="2CH.25.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
So Amaziah told those soldiers from Israel to return home. They left to go home, but they were very angry with the king of Judah <span id="add-2CH.25.10" class="usx-add">for not allowing them to stay and fight</span>.</p>
<p id="p-2CH.25.10" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2CH.25.11"><sup id="2CH.25.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
Then Amaziah became brave, and he led his army to the Salt Valley. There they killed 10,000 men from the Edom people-group. <a href="#2CH.25.12"><sup id="2CH.25.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
The army of Judah also captured 10,000 others, and took them to the top of a cliff and threw them all down over the cliff, with the result that their corpses were all smashed to pieces.</p>
<p id="p-2CH.25.12" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2CH.25.13"><sup id="2CH.25.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
While that was happening, the soldiers from Israel whom Amaziah had sent home after not allowing them to fight along with his soldiers, raided cities and towns in Judea, from Samaria <span id="add-2CH.25.13" class="usx-add">city</span> to Beth-Horon <span id="add-2CH.25.13" class="usx-add">town</span>. They killed 3,000 people and took away a great amount of valuable things.</p>
<p id="p-2CH.25.13" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2CH.25.14"><sup id="2CH.25.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
When Amaziah returned <span id="add-2CH.25.14" class="usx-add">to Jerusalem</span> after his army had slaughtered the soldiers from Edom, he brought the idols that were worshiped by the people of Edom. He set them up to be his own gods. Then he bowed down to <span id="add-2CH.25.14" class="usx-add">worship</span> them and offered sacrifices to them. <a href="#2CH.25.15"><sup id="2CH.25.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
Because of that, Yahweh was very angry with Amaziah. He sent a prophet to him, who said, “Why do you worship these foreign gods that were not even able to save their own people when your army attacked them?”</p>
<p id="p-2CH.25.15" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2CH.25.16"><sup id="2CH.25.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
While he was still speaking, the king said to him, “We certainly did not appoint you to be one of my advisors. So stop <span id="add-2CH.25.16" class="usx-add">talking</span>! If you say anything more, <span id="add-2CH.25.16" class="usx-add">I will tell my soldiers to</span> kill you!”</p>
<p id="p-2CH.25.16" class="usx-p" >So the prophet said, “I know that God has determined to get rid of you, because you have <span id="add-2CH.25.16" class="usx-add">begun to</span> worship idols, and have not heeded my advice.” Then the prophet said nothing more.</p>
<p id="p-2CH.25.16" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2CH.25.17"><sup id="2CH.25.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
Some time later Amaziah, the king of Judah, consulted his advisors. Then he sent a message to Jehoash, the king of Israel. He wrote, “Come here and let’s talk together.”</p>
<p id="p-2CH.25.17" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2CH.25.18"><sup id="2CH.25.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
But Jehoash replied to King Amaziah, “One time a thistle growing <span id="add-2CH.25.18" class="usx-add">in the mountains</span> in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar tree saying, ‘Let your daughter marry my son.’ But a wild animal in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle under its feet. <a href="#2CH.25.19"><sup id="2CH.25.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
<span id="add-2CH.25.19" class="usx-add">The meaning of what I am saying is that</span> you are saying to yourself that your army has defeated the army of Edom, so you have become very proud. But you should stay at your home. It would not be good for you to cause trouble, which would result in you and your kingdom of Judah being destroyed.”</p>
<p id="p-2CH.25.19" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2CH.25.20"><sup id="2CH.25.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
But Amaziah refused to heed Jehoash’s message. That happened because God wanted Jehoash’s army to defeat them, because they were worshiping the gods of Edom. <a href="#2CH.25.21"><sup id="2CH.25.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
So Jehoash’s army attacked. Their two armies faced each other at Beth-Shemesh <span id="add-2CH.25.21" class="usx-add">city</span> in Judah. <a href="#2CH.25.22"><sup id="2CH.25.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
The army of Judah was badly defeated by the army of Israel, and all the soldiers of Judah fled to their homes. <a href="#2CH.25.23"><sup id="2CH.25.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
King Jehoash’s army also captured King Amaziah there. Then he brought Amaziah to Jerusalem, and his soldiers tore down the wall <span id="add-2CH.25.23" class="usx-add">that was around the city</span>, from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate. That was a section that was about 600 feet long. <a href="#2CH.25.24"><sup id="2CH.25.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
His soldiers also carried away the gold and silver and other valuable furnishings from the temple which the descendants of Obed-Edom had previously been guarding. They also took away the valuable things in the palace, and they took to Samaria some prisoners whom they had captured.</p>
<p id="p-2CH.25.24" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2CH.25.25"><sup id="2CH.25.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
King Jehoash of Israel died, and King Amaziah of Judah lived for 15 years after that. <a href="#2CH.25.26"><sup id="2CH.25.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
An account of all the other things that Amaziah did while he was the king <span id="add-2CH.25.26" class="usx-add">of Judah</span> is written in the scroll called ‘The History of the Kings of Judah and Israel’. <a href="#2CH.25.27"><sup id="2CH.25.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
From the time that Amaziah started to disobey Yahweh, some men in Jerusalem planned to kill him. He was able to escape to Lachish <span id="add-2CH.25.27" class="usx-add">city</span>, but those who wanted to kill him sent another group of people to Lachish and killed him there. <a href="#2CH.25.28"><sup id="2CH.25.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
They put his corpse on a horse and brought it back to Jerusalem and buried it where his ancestors <span id="add-2CH.25.28" class="usx-add">had been buried</span> in the part of Jerusalem called ‘The City of David’.</p>
<a href="#2CH.26"><h3 id="2CH.26" class="usx-c">26</h3></a>

After King Amaziah died, all the people of Judah appointed his son Uzziah, who then was 16 years old, as their king. <span id="add-2CH.26.1-2" class="usx-add">One of the things that happened</span> while he was the king <span id="add-2CH.26.1-2" class="usx-add">was that</span> his men captured Elath <span id="add-2CH.26.1-2" class="usx-add">town on the Gulf of Aqaba</span> and rebuilt it.</p>

    <a href="#2CH.26.3"><sup id="2CH.26.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
Uzziah ruled in Jerusalem for 52 years. His mother was Jecoliah; she was from Jerusalem. <a href="#2CH.26.4"><sup id="2CH.26.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
Uzziah did things that Yahweh considered to be good, like his father Amaziah had done. <a href="#2CH.26.5"><sup id="2CH.26.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
He tried to please God while <span id="add-2CH.26.5" class="usx-add">the priest</span> Zechariah was living, because Zechariah taught him to revere God. As long as Uzziah tried to please God, God enabled him to be successful.</p>
<p id="p-2CH.26.5" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2CH.26.6"><sup id="2CH.26.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
Uzziah and his army started to fight against the army of Philistia. They tore down the walls of Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod <span id="add-2CH.26.6" class="usx-add">cities</span>. Then they rebuilt the towns near Ashdod and in other places in Philistia. <a href="#2CH.26.7"><sup id="2CH.26.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
God helped them to fight the army of Philistia and the Arabs who lived in <span id="add-2CH.26.7" class="usx-add">the town of</span> Gur-Baal and the descendants of Meun who had come to that area from Edom. <a href="#2CH.26.8"><sup id="2CH.26.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
Even the Ammon <span id="add-2CH.26.8" class="usx-add">people-group</span> paid taxes to Uzziah each year. So Uzziah became famous as far as the border of Egypt, because he had become very powerful.</p>
<p id="p-2CH.26.8" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2CH.26.9"><sup id="2CH.26.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
Uzziah’s <span id="add-2CH.26.9" class="usx-add">workers</span> built watchtowers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate, and at the place where the wall turns, and they placed weapons in them. <a href="#2CH.26.10"><sup id="2CH.26.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
They also built watchtowers in the desert and dug many wells. They did that <span id="add-2CH.26.10" class="usx-add">to provide water</span> for a lot of the king’s cattle that were in the foothills and in the plains. Uzziah liked farming, so he also stationed workers <span id="add-2CH.26.10" class="usx-add">to take care of</span> his fields and vineyards in the hills and in the fertile areas.</p>
<p id="p-2CH.26.10" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2CH.26.11"><sup id="2CH.26.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
Uzziah’s army was trained for fighting battles. They were in groups that were always ready to go into battle. Jeiel, the king’s secretary, and Maaseiah, one of the army officers, counted the men and placed them in groups. Hananiah, one of the king’s officials, was their commander. <a href="#2CH.26.12"><sup id="2CH.26.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
There were 2,600 leaders of those groups of soldiers. <a href="#2CH.26.13"><sup id="2CH.26.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
In the groups that those leaders commanded there were a total of 307,500 well-trained soldiers. It was a very powerful army which was ready to help the king fight against his enemies. <a href="#2CH.26.14"><sup id="2CH.26.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
Uzziah gave to each soldier a shield, a spear, a helmet, a vest made of iron plates, a bow <span id="add-2CH.26.14" class="usx-add">and arrows</span>, and a slingshot. <a href="#2CH.26.15"><sup id="2CH.26.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
In Jerusalem his skilled workers made machines to put on the watchtowers and on the corners <span id="add-2CH.26.15" class="usx-add">of the walls</span>, to shoot arrows and to hurl large stones. He became very famous even in distant places, because God helped him very much and enabled him to become very powerful.</p>

    <a href="#2CH.26.16"><sup id="2CH.26.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
But because Uzziah was very powerful, he became very proud, and that led to his being punished. He disobeyed what Yahweh his God had commanded. He went into the temple to burn incense on the altar <span id="add-2CH.26.16" class="usx-add">where God had said that only the priests should burn</span> incense. <a href="#2CH.26.17"><sup id="2CH.26.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
Azariah the <span id="add-2CH.26.17" class="usx-add">Supreme</span> Priest and 80 other brave priests followed him into the temple. <a href="#2CH.26.18"><sup id="2CH.26.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
They rebuked him and said to him, “Uzziah, it is not right for you to burn incense to <span id="add-2CH.26.18" class="usx-add">honor</span> Yahweh. That duty is only for the priests, those who are descendants of Aaron <span id="add-2CH.26.18" class="usx-add">our first Supreme Priest</span>! You must leave <span id="add-2CH.26.18" class="usx-add">immediately</span>, because you have disobeyed Yahweh our God, and he will not honor you <span id="add-2CH.26.18" class="usx-add">for what you have done</span>!”</p>

King Uzziah had leprosy until he died. And because he had leprosy, he lived in a house that was not near other houses, and he was not allowed to enter <span id="add-2CH.26.21" class="usx-add">the courtyard of</span> the temple. His son Jotham supervised the palace and ruled the people of Judah.</p>

A record of all the other things that Uzziah did while he was the king <span id="add-2CH.26.22" class="usx-add">of Judah</span> was written by the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz. <a href="#2CH.26.23"><sup id="2CH.26.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
Because Uzziah was a leper, <span id="add-2CH.26.23" class="usx-add">when he died,</span> they would not bury him in the tombs where the other kings were buried.

Jotham did many things that pleased Yahweh like his father Uzziah did. He obeyed Yahweh and did things that are right.

Therefore Yahweh his God allowed his army to be defeated by the army of the king of Syria. They captured many soldiers of Judah and took them as prisoners to Damascus.</p>

In one day the army of Remaliah’s son, King Pekah <span id="add-2CH.28.6" class="usx-add">of Israel</span>, killed 120,000 soldiers in Judah.

The soldiers of Israel captured 200,000 of the people of Judah, including many wives and sons and daughters <span id="add-2CH.28.8" class="usx-add">of the soldiers of Judah</span>. They also seized and took back to Samaria many valuable things.</p>

But a prophet of Yahweh whose name was Obed was there <span id="add-2CH.28.9" class="usx-add">in Samaria</span>. He went out of the city to meet the army when it returned to Samaria.

So listen to me! Send back <span id="add-2CH.28.11" class="usx-add">to Judah</span> your fellow-countrymen whom you have captured, because Yahweh is extremely angry with you <span id="add-2CH.28.11" class="usx-add">for what you did to them</span>.”</p>

They said to them, “You must not bring those prisoners here! If you do that, Yahweh will consider that we are guilty of sinning.

The leaders who were selected took some of the clothes that the soldiers had taken from the prisoners and gave those clothes back to the people who were naked. They also gave to the prisoners sandals and other clothes and things to eat and drink, and they gave them olive oil to rub on their wounds. They gave donkeys to those who were very weak, in order that they could ride on them. Then they led them all to Jericho, the city that had many palm trees. Then those leaders <span id="add-2CH.28.15" class="usx-add">of Israel</span> returned to Samaria.</p>

At the same time, men from Philistia had raided/attacked towns in the foothills and in the southern desert of Judah.

Tiglath-Pileser, the king of Assyria, sent <span id="add-2CH.28.20" class="usx-add">his army saying that they would</span> help Ahaz, but instead of helping him, they caused him to experience trouble. <a href="#2CH.28.21"><sup id="2CH.28.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>

While King Ahaz was experiencing those troubles, he disobeyed Yahweh even more. <a href="#2CH.28.23"><sup id="2CH.28.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
He offered sacrifices to the gods that were worshiped in Damascus, whose <span id="add-2CH.28.23" class="usx-add">army</span> had defeated his <span id="add-2CH.28.23" class="usx-add">army</span>. He thought, “The gods that are worshiped by the kings of Syria have helped them, so I will offer sacrifices to those gods in order that they will help me.” But worshiping those gods caused Ahaz and all of Israel to be ruined.</p>

    <a href="#2CH.28.24"><sup id="2CH.28.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
Ahaz gathered all the furnishings <span id="add-2CH.28.24" class="usx-add">that were used</span> in the temple and broke them into pieces.

In every town in Judah, his workers built shrines to burn sacrifices to other gods, and that caused Yahweh, the God whom their ancestors <span id="add-2CH.28.25" class="usx-add">worshiped</span>, to be very angry.</p>

A record of the other things that Ahaz did while he was the king, from when he started to rule until he died, is written in the scroll called ‘The History of the Kings of Judah and Israel’. <a href="#2CH.28.27"><sup id="2CH.28.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
Ahaz died and was buried in Jerusalem, but he was not buried in the tombs where the other kings <span id="add-2CH.28.27" class="usx-add">had been buried</span>. Then his son Hezekiah became the king.</p>
<a href="#2CH.29"><h3 id="2CH.29" class="usx-c">29</h3></a>

Hezekiah was 25 years old when he became the king <span id="add-2CH.29.1" class="usx-add">of Judah</span>. He ruled from Jerusalem for 29 years.

During March of the first year that Hezekiah was ruling Judah, he unlocked the doors of the temple, and his workers repaired them. <a href="#2CH.29.4"><sup id="2CH.29.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
Then he gathered the priests and other descendants of Levi in the area on the east side of the temple, <a href="#2CH.29.5"><sup id="2CH.29.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
and he said to them, “You descendants of Levi, listen to me! Consecrate yourselves. And then consecrate the temple of Yahweh, the God whom our ancestors <span id="add-2CH.29.5" class="usx-add">worshiped/belonged to</span>. Remove from the temple all the things that are not pleasing to God. <a href="#2CH.29.6"><sup id="2CH.29.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
Our ancestors disobeyed God; they did many things that he considered to be evil, things that were not pleasing to him. They abandoned this place where Yahweh lives, and they have turned away from him. <a href="#2CH.29.7"><sup id="2CH.29.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
They locked the doors of the temple and extinguished the lamps. They did not burn any incense, and they did not offer any sacrifices that were to be completely burned <span id="add-2CH.29.7" class="usx-add">on the altar</span>. <a href="#2CH.29.8"><sup id="2CH.29.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
Therefore, Yahweh has become very angry with us people of Jerusalem and <span id="add-2CH.29.8" class="usx-add">other places in</span> Judah, and he has caused other people to become frightened and horrified <span id="add-2CH.29.8" class="usx-add">when they hear what Yahweh did to punish us</span>.

When those men had gathered their fellow descendants of Levi and had consecrated themselves, they entered the temple in order to consecrate it.

The priests entered the temple to consecrate it. They brought out into the courtyard of the temple everything that they had found in the temple that was not pleasing to Yahweh. Then the descendants of Levi took those things down to the Kidron Valley <span id="add-2CH.29.16" class="usx-add">and burned them there</span>. <a href="#2CH.29.17"><sup id="2CH.29.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
The priests and other descendants of Levi started this work on the first day of March and finished purifying the courtyard <span id="add-2CH.29.17" class="usx-add">of the temple</span> on the eighth day of that month, and they finished purifying the temple one week later.</p>

    <a href="#2CH.29.18"><sup id="2CH.29.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
Then they went to King Hezekiah and reported, “We have purified all parts of the temple, and the altar where sacrifices are completely burned, and all the items used at the altar, the table on which the priests place the sacred bread, and the things <span id="add-2CH.29.18" class="usx-add">used at that table</span>. <a href="#2CH.29.19"><sup id="2CH.29.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
While Ahaz was our king, he disobeyed what Yahweh had commanded, and he removed from the temple many things <span id="add-2CH.29.19" class="usx-add">that should be there</span>, but now we have brought them back and placed them in front of the sacred altar.”</p>

They took with them seven bulls, seven rams, seven male lambs, and seven male goats to be an offering in order that Yahweh would forgive the sins of all the people in the kingdom of Judah, and in order to purify the temple. The king commanded that the priests, who were descendants of Aaron, should offer those animals to be sacrificed to Yahweh on the altar. <a href="#2CH.29.22"><sup id="2CH.29.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
So first the priests slaughtered those bulls, and took their blood and sprinkled it on the altar. Then they slaughtered the rams and sprinkled their blood on the altar.

The goats that were slaughtered to be an offering in order that Yahweh would forgive the sins of the people were brought to the king and the others who were there.

Then the priests slaughtered those goats and splashed their blood on the altar in order that Yahweh would forgive the sins that all the Israeli people had committed. The priests did that because the king had commanded that offerings that would be completely burned <span id="add-2CH.29.24" class="usx-add">on the altar</span> and other sacrifices should be made for all the people of Israel.</p>

    <a href="#2CH.29.25"><sup id="2CH.29.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
The king then told the descendants of Levi to stand in the temple with their cymbals and harps and lyres, obeying what David and his prophets Gad and Nathan had commanded. Those were things that Yahweh had told his prophets that the descendants of Levi should do. <a href="#2CH.29.26"><sup id="2CH.29.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
So the descendants of Levi <span id="add-2CH.29.26" class="usx-add">went and</span> stood in the temple, ready to play the musical instruments that King David had given to them. And the priests were ready to blow their trumpets.</p>

    <a href="#2CH.29.27"><sup id="2CH.29.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
Then Hezekiah told some of the priests to burn the animals that would be sacrificed on the altar. When they started to burn the animals, the people started to sing to <span id="add-2CH.29.27" class="usx-add">praise</span> Yahweh, while the other descendants of Levi were playing their instruments. <a href="#2CH.29.28"><sup id="2CH.29.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
All the people who were there bowed to worship Yahweh, while the singers sang and the trumpeters blew their trumpets. They continued to do this until they had finished slaughtering all the animals that would be completely burned.</p>

    <a href="#2CH.29.29"><sup id="2CH.29.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>
When they finished making those offerings, the king and all those who were there knelt down and worshiped Yahweh. <a href="#2CH.29.30"><sup id="2CH.29.30" class="usx-v">30</sup></a>
Then King Hezekiah and his officials commanded the descendants of Levi to praise Yahweh, singing the songs <span id="add-2CH.29.30" class="usx-add">composed/written</span> by David and Asaph the prophet. So they sang songs joyfully and bowed their heads to worship.</p>
<p id="p-2CH.29.30" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2CH.29.31"><sup id="2CH.29.31" class="usx-v">31</sup></a>
Then Hezekiah said, “You have now dedicated yourselves to Yahweh. So come close to the temple and bring animals to be sacrificed and other offerings to thank <span id="add-2CH.29.31" class="usx-add">Yahweh for what he has done for you</span>.” And those who wanted to bring animals to be completely burned <span id="add-2CH.29.31" class="usx-add">on the altar</span> brought them.</p>

    <a href="#2CH.29.32"><sup id="2CH.29.32" class="usx-v">32</sup></a>
Altogether they brought 70 bulls, 100 rams, and 200 male lambs to be completely burned on the altar. <a href="#2CH.29.33"><sup id="2CH.29.33" class="usx-v">33</sup></a>
The other animals that they brought were 600 bulls and 3,000 sheep and goats that were set apart to be sacrifices. <a href="#2CH.29.34"><sup id="2CH.29.34" class="usx-v">34</sup></a>
But there were not enough priests to remove the skins from the animals that would be completely burned <span id="add-2CH.29.34" class="usx-add">on the altar</span>. So their fellow descendants of Levi helped them until that work was finished, and until other priests had purified/consecrated themselves to do that work. It was necessary for them to do that because many of the priests had not yet performed the rituals to consecrate themselves for that work, like the descendants of Levi had done.</p>

    <a href="#2CH.29.35"><sup id="2CH.29.35" class="usx-v">35</sup></a>
In addition to the all the offerings that were completely burned <span id="add-2CH.29.35" class="usx-add">on the altar</span>, the priests also burned the fat of the other animals that were sacrificed to maintain good fellowship with Yahweh, and the usual wine offerings.</p>
<p id="p-2CH.29.35" class="usx-p" >So the worship at the temple began again. <a href="#2CH.29.36"><sup id="2CH.29.36" class="usx-v">36</sup></a>

The king and his officials and all the other people who had gathered in Jerusalem wanted to celebrate the Passover Festival.

So a huge crowd of people gathered in Jerusalem in May, to celebrate the Festival of Eating Unleavened Bread. <a href="#2CH.30.14"><sup id="2CH.30.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
They removed the altars <span id="add-2CH.30.14" class="usx-add">of Baal</span> in Jerusalem and took away the altars for burning incense <span id="add-2CH.30.14" class="usx-add">to honor other gods, and burned them</span> in Kidron Valley.</p>

    <a href="#2CH.30.15"><sup id="2CH.30.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
They slaughtered the Passover lambs on the fourteenth day of that month. Some of the priests and the other descendants of Levi were ashamed <span id="add-2CH.30.15" class="usx-add">because they had not performed the rituals to cause them to be acceptable to work for Yahweh</span>. So they performed those rituals, and brought to the temple animals to be completely burned <span id="add-2CH.30.15" class="usx-add">on the altar</span>.</p>

    <a href="#2CH.30.16"><sup id="2CH.30.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
Then they stood at the places where Moses had written in his laws that they should stand. Then the descendants of Levi gave to the priests <span id="add-2CH.30.16" class="usx-add">bowls containing blood of the animals that were being sacrificed</span>, and the priests sprinkled <span id="add-2CH.30.16" class="usx-add">the altar</span> with some of the blood. <a href="#2CH.30.17"><sup id="2CH.30.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
Many people in the crowd had not purified themselves, and therefore they were not able to kill the lambs <span id="add-2CH.30.17" class="usx-add">and dedicate them</span> to Yahweh. So it was necessary for the descendants of Levi to kill the lambs for them. <a href="#2CH.30.18"><sup id="2CH.30.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
Although most of the people who had come from <span id="add-2CH.30.18" class="usx-add">the tribes of</span> Ephraim, Manasseh, and Issachar had not purified themselves, they ate the food of the Passover Festival anyway, ignoring the rules written <span id="add-2CH.30.18" class="usx-add">by Moses</span>. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying “Yahweh, you always do what is good; I pray that you will forgive everyone <a href="#2CH.30.19"><sup id="2CH.30.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
who sincerely wants to honor you, the God whom our ancestors <span id="add-2CH.30.19" class="usx-add">worshiped</span>, even if they have not purified themselves by obeying the sacred laws that you gave to us.” <a href="#2CH.30.20"><sup id="2CH.30.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
And Yahweh heard what Hezekiah prayed; he forgave the people, <span id="add-2CH.30.20" class="usx-add">and did not punish them</span>.</p>

    <a href="#2CH.30.21"><sup id="2CH.30.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
The Israeli people who were there in Jerusalem celebrated the Festival of Eating Unleavened Bread for seven days.

    <a href="#2CH.30.22"><sup id="2CH.30.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
Hezekiah thanked all the descendants of Levi for doing this work for Yahweh, and for very skillfully leading the people who were worshiping. For those seven days the people ate the Passover food and brought offerings to maintain fellowship with Yahweh and praised Yahweh, the God whom their ancestors <span id="add-2CH.30.22" class="usx-add">belonged to/had worshiped</span>.</p>

    <a href="#2CH.30.23"><sup id="2CH.30.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
Then the whole group decided to celebrate for seven more days, so they did: They celebrated joyfully for seven more days. <a href="#2CH.30.24"><sup id="2CH.30.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
King Hezekiah provided 1,000 bulls and 7,000 sheep to be slaughtered for the people <span id="add-2CH.30.24" class="usx-add">to eat during the festival</span>, and the officials also gave them 1,000 bulls and 10,000 sheep and goats.

Hezekiah divided the priests and <span id="add-2CH.31.2" class="usx-add">other</span> descendants of Levi into groups. He appointed some of the groups to offer sacrifices that would be completely burned <span id="add-2CH.31.2" class="usx-add">on the altar</span> and offerings to maintain fellowship <span id="add-2CH.31.2" class="usx-add">with Yahweh</span>.

The king contributed some of his own funds to buy animals that would be sacrificed in the morning and in the evening of each day, and on the Sabbath days, to celebrate the new moons, and during the other feasts, according to what was written in the laws <span id="add-2CH.31.3" class="usx-add">that Yahweh gave to Moses</span>. <a href="#2CH.31.4"><sup id="2CH.31.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
Hezekiah told the people living in Jerusalem to give to the priests and the other descendants of Levi the portions <span id="add-2CH.31.4" class="usx-add">of meat</span> that should be given to them, in order that they could devote all their time to obeying the laws of Yahweh. <a href="#2CH.31.5"><sup id="2CH.31.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
As soon as he told that to the people, they generously gave the first part of their harvest of grain, and the first part of the new wine <span id="add-2CH.31.5" class="usx-add">that they produced</span>, and <span id="add-2CH.31.5" class="usx-add">olive</span> oil and honey, and of the crops that grew in their fields.

The men of Israel and Judah who were living in various towns in Judah also brought a tenth of their cattle and sheep and goats, and a tenth of other things that they had dedicated to Yahweh their God, and they piled all those things in heaps. <a href="#2CH.31.7"><sup id="2CH.31.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
They started to do that in May and finished doing it in September. <a href="#2CH.31.8"><sup id="2CH.31.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
When Hezekiah and his officials saw the heaps, they praised Yahweh and <span id="add-2CH.31.8" class="usx-add">requested God to</span> bless the people.</p>

    <a href="#2CH.31.9"><sup id="2CH.31.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
But Hezekiah asked the priests and other descendants of Levi, “Why are these heaps of things here?” <a href="#2CH.31.10"><sup id="2CH.31.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
Then Azariah the <span id="add-2CH.31.10" class="usx-add">Supreme</span> Priest, a descendant of Zadok, replied, “Since the time that the people started to bring their offerings to the temple, we have had even more food than we need. This has happened because Yahweh has greatly blessed our fellow Israelis, with the result that all this is left over <span id="add-2CH.31.10" class="usx-add">after we priests and other descendants of Levi took all that we need</span>!”</p>

    <a href="#2CH.31.11"><sup id="2CH.31.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
Then Hezekiah ordered that they should prepare storerooms in the temple. So they did that. <a href="#2CH.31.12"><sup id="2CH.31.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
Then they brought into the storerooms all the tithes and offerings and the things dedicated to Yahweh <span id="add-2CH.31.12" class="usx-add">which the people had brought</span>.

Those two men supervised Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismakiah, Mahath and Benaiah while they did the work. They were appointed by King Hezekiah; Azariah was in charge of <span id="add-2CH.31.13" class="usx-add">everything that was done in</span> the temple.</p>

Kore the son of Imnah, another descendant of Levi, who guarded the east gate of the temple, was in charge of the offerings to God that were made voluntarily.

The names of the priests were on the scrolls where their clans’ names were written.

    <span id="add-2CH.31.19" class="usx-add">Hezekiah</span> also appointed other men to distribute portions of those offerings to the priests and other descendants of Levi who were living in the pasturelands around the towns in Judah.

After King Hezekiah had obeyed Yahweh’s instructions and had done all those things, King Sennacherib of Assyria came <span id="add-2CH.32.1" class="usx-add">with his army</span> and invaded Judah.

So a large group of men gathered together and blocked all the springs and the stream that flowed through that area. <a href="#2CH.32.5"><sup id="2CH.32.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
Then they worked hard to repair all the sections of the city wall that had been broken, and they built watchtowers on the walls. They built another wall outside/around the wall that was already outside the city, and they strengthened the defenses on the sloping terraces <span id="add-2CH.32.5" class="usx-add">on the east side of the area called ‘The City of David’</span>.

Hezekiah appointed army commanders, and he gathered them in front of him in the square at one of the city gates, and he encouraged them by saying this to them: <a href="#2CH.32.7"><sup id="2CH.32.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
“Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged on account of the king of Assyria and the huge army that is with him, because <span id="add-2CH.32.7" class="usx-add">Yahweh</span> is with us, and his <span id="add-2CH.32.7" class="usx-add">power</span> is greater than their <span id="add-2CH.32.7" class="usx-add">power</span>. <a href="#2CH.32.8"><sup id="2CH.32.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
They have to rely on the power of humans, but we have Yahweh our God to help us and to fight battles for us.” So the people became more confident because of what Hezekiah, the king of Judah, said.</p>

Hezekiah says to you, “Yahweh our God will save us from <span id="add-2CH.32.11" class="usx-add">being defeated by the army of</span> the king of Assyria,” but he is misleading you. He wants you to die from having no food or water. <a href="#2CH.32.12"><sup id="2CH.32.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
Isn’t Hezekiah the one who told his men to get rid of your god Yahweh’s shrines and altars on the hilltops, saying to <span id="add-2CH.32.12" class="usx-add">you people of</span> Jerusalem and other places in Judah, “You must worship at only one altar and burn sacrifices on only that altar”?</p>

So do not allow Hezekiah to deceive you like this.

    <a href="#2CH.32.16"><sup id="2CH.32.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
Sennacherib’s officers said more things to belittle Yahweh the God of the Israelis and Hezekiah, who served God <span id="add-2CH.32.16" class="usx-add">well</span>. <a href="#2CH.32.17"><sup id="2CH.32.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
King Sennacherib wrote more letters insulting Yahweh, the God whom the Israelis <span id="add-2CH.32.17" class="usx-add">belonged to/worshiped</span>. He said things like this: “The gods <span id="add-2CH.32.17" class="usx-add">worshiped by</span> the people-groups in other countries did not rescue their people from my power. Similarly, the god of Hezekiah will not rescue his people from my power.” <a href="#2CH.32.18"><sup id="2CH.32.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
Then King Sennachereb’s officers shouted in the Hebrew language to the people who were on the wall, in order to cause them to be terrified, thinking that as a result the army of Assyria could capture the city <span id="add-2CH.32.18" class="usx-add">without a battle</span>. <a href="#2CH.32.19"><sup id="2CH.32.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
They belittled the God <span id="add-2CH.32.19" class="usx-add">worshiped by the people</span> of Jerusalem as they belittled the gods of the other people-groups of the world—saying that they were only <span id="add-2CH.32.19" class="usx-add">idols</span> made by humans.</p>

    <a href="#2CH.32.20"><sup id="2CH.32.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>

And <span id="add-2CH.32.21" class="usx-add">that night</span> Yahweh sent an angel who killed all the soldiers of Assyria and their leaders and their officers in the place where the king of Assyria and his army had set up their tents.

Many people brought offerings for Yahweh to Jerusalem, and also brought valuable gifts for King Hezekiah. And from that time, Hezekiah was highly respected/honored by the people of all the other nations.</p>
<p id="s1-2CH.32.23" class="usx-s1" >Hezekiah became proud</p>
<p id="p-2CH.32.23" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2CH.32.24"><sup id="2CH.32.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
About that time, Hezekiah became very ill. He was about to die. But he prayed to Yahweh, and Yahweh answered his prayer. He performed a miracle <span id="add-2CH.32.24" class="usx-add">and healed Hezekiah</span>. <a href="#2CH.32.25"><sup id="2CH.32.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
But Hezekiah [SYN] was very proud, and he did not thank Yahweh for being kind to him. Therefore Yahweh was angry with him and <span id="add-2CH.32.25" class="usx-add">and punished him</span> and <span id="add-2CH.32.25" class="usx-add">the people of</span> Jerusalem and other places in Judah. <a href="#2CH.32.26"><sup id="2CH.32.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
Then Hezekiah said that he was sorry for being proud, and the people of Jerusalem also said that they were sorry <span id="add-2CH.32.26" class="usx-add">for their sins</span>. So Yahweh did not punish them during the remaining years that Hezekiah <span id="add-2CH.32.26" class="usx-add">was their king</span>.</p>
<p id="s1-2CH.32.26" class="usx-s1" >Hezekiah became very rich</p>

    <a href="#2CH.32.27"><sup id="2CH.32.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
Hezekiah became very rich and was greatly honored. His <span id="add-2CH.32.27" class="usx-add">workers</span> made storerooms for his silver and gold, and for his very valuable stones, and for spices and shields and other valuable things. <a href="#2CH.32.28"><sup id="2CH.32.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
<span id="add-2CH.32.28" class="usx-add">His workers</span> also built buildings to store the grain and wine and <span id="add-2CH.32.28" class="usx-add">olive</span> oil <span id="add-2CH.32.28" class="usx-add">that people produced and brought to him</span>.

They built towns and acquired for the king many flocks <span id="add-2CH.32.29" class="usx-add">of sheep and goats</span> and herds <span id="add-2CH.32.29" class="usx-add">of cattle</span>, because God had enabled him to become very rich.</p>

    <a href="#2CH.32.30"><sup id="2CH.32.30" class="usx-v">30</sup></a>
Hezekiah was the one who told his workers to block the place where the water flows out of the Gihon Spring, and to build a tunnel through which the water flowed to the west side of the area called ‘The City of David’. He was able to do everything that he wanted to do. <a href="#2CH.32.31"><sup id="2CH.32.31" class="usx-v">31</sup></a>
But when messengers who were sent by the rulers of Babylon came and asked about the miracle that God had performed for him, God allowed Hezekiah to say what he himself wanted to say, in order to test <span id="add-2CH.32.31" class="usx-add">whether or not Hezekiah would admit that God had performed a miracle</span>.</p>

    <a href="#2CH.32.32"><sup id="2CH.32.32" class="usx-v">32</sup></a>
A record of the other things that happened while Hezekiah was ruling, and the things that he did to please God, is on the scroll in which is written the vision that <span id="add-2CH.32.32" class="usx-add">Yahweh gave to</span> the prophet Isaiah. It is also written in the scroll called ‘The History of the Kings of Judah and Israel’. <a href="#2CH.32.33"><sup id="2CH.32.33" class="usx-v">33</sup></a>
When Hezekiah died, he was buried in the tombs where the most respected kings <span id="add-2CH.32.33" class="usx-add">of Judah</span> were buried. Everyone in Jerusalem and other places in Judah honored him. Then his son Manasseh became the king.</p>

    <a href="#2CH.33.1"><sup id="2CH.33.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
Manasseh was 12 years old when he became the king <span id="add-2CH.33.1" class="usx-add">of Judah</span>, and he ruled from Jerusalem for 55 years. <a href="#2CH.33.2"><sup id="2CH.33.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
He did many things that Yahweh considered to be evil. He imitated the disgusting things that were formerly done by the people-groups that Yahweh had expelled from Israel as his people advanced <span id="add-2CH.33.2" class="usx-add">though the land</span>. <a href="#2CH.33.3"><sup id="2CH.33.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
He commanded his workers to rebuild the shrines <span id="add-2CH.33.3" class="usx-add">for worshiping idols</span> that his father Hezekiah had destroyed. He told them to set up altars to <span id="add-2CH.33.3" class="usx-add">honor</span> the statues of Baal, and to make altars to <span id="add-2CH.33.3" class="usx-add">honor the goddess</span> Asherah. He bowed down to <span id="add-2CH.33.3" class="usx-add">worship</span> all the stars. <a href="#2CH.33.4"><sup id="2CH.33.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
He directed his workers to build altars <span id="add-2CH.33.4" class="usx-add">for foreign gods</span> in the temple, about which Yahweh had said, “It is here in Jerusalem that I want people to worship me, forever.” <a href="#2CH.33.5"><sup id="2CH.33.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
He directed that altars for <span id="add-2CH.33.5" class="usx-add">worshiping</span> all the stars be built in both of the courtyards outside the temple. <a href="#2CH.33.6"><sup id="2CH.33.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
He even sacrificed <span id="add-2CH.33.6" class="usx-add">some of</span> his own sons and burned them in a fire in Hinnom Valley. He performed rituals to practice sorcery. He asked fortune-tellers for advice. He performed witchcraft. He talked to people who consulted the spirits of people who had died to find out what would happen in the future. He did many things that Yahweh considered o be very evil, things that caused Yahweh to become very angry.</p>
<p id="p-2CH.33.6" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2CH.33.7"><sup id="2CH.33.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Manasseh took a carved idol <span id="add-2CH.33.7" class="usx-add">that his workers had made</span> and put it in the temple. That is the temple concerning which God had said to David and to his son Solomon, “My temple will be here in Jerusalem, the city that I have chosen <span id="add-2CH.33.7" class="usx-add">where I want people to</span> worship me, forever. <a href="#2CH.33.8"><sup id="2CH.33.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
If they will obey all the laws and decrees and regulations that I told Moses to give to them, I will not again force the Israeli people to leave this land that I gave to their ancestors.” <a href="#2CH.33.9"><sup id="2CH.33.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
But Manasseh led the people of Jerusalem and other places in Judah to do things that are wrong, with the result that they did more evil than was done by the people in the people-groups that Yahweh had expelled as the Israeli people advanced <span id="add-2CH.33.9" class="usx-add">through the land</span>.</p>
<p id="p-2CH.33.9" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2CH.33.10"><sup id="2CH.33.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
Yahweh spoke to Manasseh and the people of Judah, but they paid no attention. <a href="#2CH.33.11"><sup id="2CH.33.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
So Yahweh caused the army commanders of Assyria <span id="add-2CH.33.11" class="usx-add">and their soldiers</span> to <span id="add-2CH.33.11" class="usx-add">come to Jerusalem, and they</span> captured Manasseh. They put a hook in his nose and put bronze chains on his <span id="add-2CH.33.11" class="usx-add">feet</span> and took him to Babylon. <a href="#2CH.33.12"><sup id="2CH.33.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
There, while he was suffering, he humbled himself greatly in the presence of Yahweh, the God whom his ancestors <span id="add-2CH.33.12" class="usx-add">worshiped</span>, and pleaded with Yahweh to help him. <a href="#2CH.33.13"><sup id="2CH.33.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
When he prayed, Yahweh heard him and pitied him. So he <span id="add-2CH.33.13" class="usx-add">allowed him to</span> return to Jerusalem and <span id="add-2CH.33.13" class="usx-add">to</span> rule his kingdom again. Then Manasseh realized that Yahweh is <span id="add-2CH.33.13" class="usx-add">an all-powerful</span> God.</p>
<p id="p-2CH.33.13" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#2CH.33.14"><sup id="2CH.33.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
Later, Manasseh’s <span id="add-2CH.33.14" class="usx-add">workers</span> rebuilt the eastern section of the outer wall around Jerusalem, and <span id="add-2CH.33.14" class="usx-add">they</span> made it higher. That section extended from Gihon Spring <span id="add-2CH.33.14" class="usx-add">north</span> to the Fish Gate, and around the part of the city that they called Ophel <span id="add-2CH.33.14" class="usx-add">Hill</span>. Manasseh also appointed army officers to guard each of the cities in Judah that had walls around them. <a href="#2CH.33.15"><sup id="2CH.33.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
Manasseh’s <span id="add-2CH.33.15" class="usx-add">workers</span> removed from the temple the idols and the stone statues of gods of other nations. Manasseh also <span id="add-2CH.33.15" class="usx-add">told them to</span> remove the altars that they had previously built on Zion Hill and in <span id="add-2CH.33.15" class="usx-add">other places in</span> Jerusalem. He had all those things thrown out of the city. <a href="#2CH.33.16"><sup id="2CH.33.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
Then he <span id="add-2CH.33.16" class="usx-add">told them to</span> repair the altar of Yahweh, and he offered sacrifices to restore fellowship with Yahweh and to thank him. And he told <span id="add-2CH.33.16" class="usx-add">the people of</span> Judah that they must worship <span id="add-2CH.33.16" class="usx-add">only</span> Yahweh. <a href="#2CH.33.17"><sup id="2CH.33.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
The people continued to offer sacrifices on the hilltops, but only to Yahweh their God.</p>

    <a href="#2CH.33.18"><sup id="2CH.33.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
The other things that happened while Manasseh was ruling, including his prayer to God and the messages from Yahweh that the prophets gave to him, are written in the scroll called ‘The History of the Kings of Israel’. <a href="#2CH.33.19"><sup id="2CH.33.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>

Manasseh died and was buried in his palace. Then his son Amon became the king <span id="add-2CH.33.20" class="usx-add">of Judah</span>.</p>

He did things that Yahweh considered to be evil, like his father Manasseh had done. Amon worshiped all the idols that Manasseh’s <span id="add-2CH.33.22" class="usx-add">workers</span> had made. <a href="#2CH.33.23"><sup id="2CH.33.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
But he did not humble himself and turn to Yahweh like his father did. So he became more sinful than his father had been.</p>

    <a href="#2CH.33.24"><sup id="2CH.33.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
Then Amon’s officials made plans to kill him. They assassinated him in his palace. <a href="#2CH.33.25"><sup id="2CH.33.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
But then the people of Judah killed all those who had assassinated Amon, and they appointed his son Josiah to be their king.</p>

When he had been ruling for almost eight years, while he was still a young man, he began to worship God like his ancestor <span id="add-2CH.34.3" class="usx-add">King</span> David had done.

They burned the bones of the priests <span id="add-2CH.34.5" class="usx-add">who had offered sacrifices</span>; they burned them on their own altars.

The king of Judah sent you to ask what I, Yahweh, want. Go and tell him that this is what I, Yahweh, the God whom you Israelis worship, say about what you read: <a href="#2CH.34.27"><sup id="2CH.34.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>

They went up together to the temple with the leaders of Judah and many other people of Jerusalem and the priests and other descendants of Levi, from the least important to the most important ones.

Josiah <span id="add-2CH.35.1" class="usx-add">commanded that the people should</span> celebrate the Passover Festival to honor Yahweh in Jerusalem.

The <span id="add-2CH.35.3" class="usx-add">other</span> descendants of Levi were the ones who taught all the Israeli people; they had been dedicated to serve Yahweh.

Everything <span id="add-2CH.35.10" class="usx-add">for the Passover</span> was arranged: The priests and the other descendants of Levi stood in their places in their groups, like the king had commanded. <a href="#2CH.35.11"><sup id="2CH.35.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
Then they slaughtered the Passover lambs.

They set aside the animals to be completely burned on the altar, in order to give them to the various family groups to offer to Yahweh, obeying the instructions that were written in the laws God gave Moses. They did the same thing with the cattle. <a href="#2CH.35.13"><sup id="2CH.35.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Obeying those regulations, they roasted the lambs for the Passover over the fire.

After that, they prepared meat for themselves and for the priests, because the priests were busy until nighttime, sacrificing the offerings to be completely burned and burning the fat parts of the offerings. So the <span id="add-2CH.35.14" class="usx-add">other</span> descendants of Levi prepared meat for themselves and for the priests, who were descendants of Aaron, <span id="add-2CH.35.14" class="usx-add">the first Supreme Priest</span>.</p>

The musicians, who were descendants of Asaph, stood in their places, as King David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s prophet had commanded. The men who guarded the gates <span id="add-2CH.35.15" class="usx-add">of the temple</span> did not need to leave their places, because their fellow descendants of Levi prepared food for them to eat.</p>

    <a href="#2CH.35.16"><sup id="2CH.35.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
So on that day everything that needed to done for worshiping Yahweh was done. They celebrated the Passover <span id="add-2CH.35.16" class="usx-add">Festival</span>, and they presented offerings to be completely burned on the altar, which was what Josiah had commanded. <a href="#2CH.35.17"><sup id="2CH.35.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
The Israelis who were there celebrated the Passover <span id="add-2CH.35.17" class="usx-add">Festival</span> on that day, and for seven days they celebrated the Festival of <span id="add-2CH.35.17" class="usx-add">Eating</span> Unleavened Bread. <a href="#2CH.35.18"><sup id="2CH.35.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
The Passover <span id="add-2CH.35.18" class="usx-add">Festival</span> had not been celebrated like that in Israel since the time that the prophet Samuel lived. None of the other kings of Israel had ever celebrated the Passover like Josiah did, along with the priests, the other descendants of Levi, and all <span id="add-2CH.35.18" class="usx-add">the other people of</span> Judah and Israel who were there with the people who lived in Jerusalem. <a href="#2CH.35.19"><sup id="2CH.35.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>

Neco sent some messengers to Josiah, to tell him, “You are the king of Judah, and there is certainly no quarrel between you and me.

    <a href="#2CH.35.22"><sup id="2CH.35.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
But Josiah would not pay attention to him. Instead, he disguised himself in order to be able to attack <span id="add-2CH.35.22" class="usx-add">the army of Egypt without anyone recognizing him</span>. He did not pay any attention to what God had told Neco to say. Instead, he <span id="add-2CH.35.22" class="usx-add">and his army</span> went to fight Neco’s army at the plain of Megiddo.</p>

So they took him out of his chariot and put him in another chariot that he had brought with him, and they took him to Jerusalem, where he died.
