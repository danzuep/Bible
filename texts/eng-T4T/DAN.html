    <a href="#DAN.1.1"><sup id="DAN.1.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
After King Jehoiakim had been ruling in Judah for almost three years, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came to Jerusalem <span id="add-DAN.1.1" class="usx-add">with his army</span> and surrounded the city. <a href="#DAN.1.2"><sup id="DAN.1.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
<span id="add-DAN.1.2" class="usx-add">After two years,</span> Yahweh allowed Nebuchadnezzar’s <span id="add-DAN.1.2" class="usx-add">soldiers </span> to capture Jehoiakim, <span id="add-DAN.1.2" class="usx-add">who was the</span> King of Judah. They also took some of the things that were in the temple of God, and took them to Babylonia. There Nebuchadnezzar put them in the temple of his god.</p>
<p id="p-DAN.1.2" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.1.3"><sup id="DAN.1.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
Then Nebuchadnezzar commanded Ashpenaz, the chief official in his palace, to bring <span id="add-DAN.1.3" class="usx-add">to him</span> some of the Israeli men <span id="add-DAN.1.3" class="usx-add">whom they had brought to Babylon. He wanted men </span> who belonged to important families, including the family of the King of Judah. <a href="#DAN.1.4"><sup id="DAN.1.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
<span id="add-DAN.1.4" class="usx-add">King Nebuchadnezzar wanted only</span> men who were very healthy, handsome/good-looking, wise, well-educated, capable of learning many things, and suitable for working in the palace. He also wanted to teach them the Babylonian language and have them read things that had been written in the Babylonian language. <a href="#DAN.1.5"><sup id="DAN.1.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
The king commanded <span id="add-DAN.1.5" class="usx-add">his servants</span>, “Give them the same kind of food and wine that is given to me. Train them for three years. Then they will become my servants.”</p>
<p id="p-DAN.1.5" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.1.6"><sup id="DAN.1.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
Among the young Israeli men <span id="add-DAN.1.6" class="usx-add">who were chosen</span> were <span id="add-DAN.1.6" class="usx-add">me</span>, Daniel, and Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, who all came from Judah. <a href="#DAN.1.7"><sup id="DAN.1.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
But Ashpenaz gave us <span id="add-DAN.1.7" class="usx-add">Babylonian</span> names. The name he gave to me was Belteshazzar, the name he gave to Hananiah was Shadrach, the name he gave to Mishael was Meshach, and the name he gave to Azariah was Abednego.</p>
<p id="p-DAN.1.7" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.1.8"><sup id="DAN.1.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
But I decided that I would not eat the kind of food that the king ate, or drink the wine that he drank, because that would make me ◄ritually defiled/unacceptable to God►. So I asked Ashpenaz to allow me to eat and drink other things. <a href="#DAN.1.9"><sup id="DAN.1.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
God had caused Ashpenaz to greatly respect me, <a href="#DAN.1.10"><sup id="DAN.1.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
but he was worried about what I suggested. He said, “My master, the king, has commanded that you eat the kinds of food and drink that he does. If <span id="add-DAN.1.10" class="usx-add">you eat other things and as a result</span> you become more thin and pale than the other young men who are your age, he will <span id="add-DAN.1.10" class="usx-add">order his soldiers to</span> cut off my head because of what you have done!”</p>
<p id="p-DAN.1.10" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.1.11"><sup id="DAN.1.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
Ashpenaz had ordered a guard to watch me, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. <a href="#DAN.1.12"><sup id="DAN.1.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
So I said to this guard: “<span id="add-DAN.1.12" class="usx-add">Please</span> test us for ten days. <span id="add-DAN.1.12" class="usx-add">During that time</span> give us <span id="add-DAN.1.12" class="usx-add">only</span> vegetables to eat and water to drink. <a href="#DAN.1.13"><sup id="DAN.1.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
After ten days, see how we look, and see how the other young men look, the ones who are eating the kind of food that the king eats. Then you can decide about <span id="add-DAN.1.13" class="usx-add">what food you will let us eat</span>.” <a href="#DAN.1.14"><sup id="DAN.1.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
The guard agreed to do what I suggested, and he tested us like that for ten days.</p>
<p id="p-DAN.1.14" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.1.15"><sup id="DAN.1.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
After ten days, <span id="add-DAN.1.15" class="usx-add">he saw that</span> my three friends and I looked healthier [DOU] than the young men who had been eating the food that the king wanted them to eat. <a href="#DAN.1.16"><sup id="DAN.1.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
So after that, the guard gave us <span id="add-DAN.1.16" class="usx-add">only</span> vegetables to eat; he did not give us the king’s special food and wine.</p>
<p id="p-DAN.1.16" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.1.17"><sup id="DAN.1.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
And God gave to us four young men wisdom and the ability to study many things that Babylonians had written and studied. And <span id="add-DAN.1.17" class="usx-add">he also gave to</span> me the ability to understand the meaning of visions and dreams.</p>
<p id="p-DAN.1.17" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.1.18"><sup id="DAN.1.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
When those three years that the king had set for training us young men from Judah were ended, Ashpenaz brought all of us to King Nebuchadnezzar. <a href="#DAN.1.19"><sup id="DAN.1.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
The king talked with <span id="add-DAN.1.19" class="usx-add">each of</span> us, and realized that none of the other young men were as capable as Hananiah, Mishael, Azariah and I were. So we four became the king’s special advisors/servants. <a href="#DAN.1.20"><sup id="DAN.1.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
In all important matters, the king found that what we <span id="add-DAN.1.20" class="usx-add">four men</span> advised was ten times as good as what all the magicians and sorcerers/fortune-tellers in his kingdom advised.</p>
<p id="p-DAN.1.20" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.1.21"><sup id="DAN.1.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
I remained <span id="add-DAN.1.21" class="usx-add">there serving the king more than 60 years</span>, until the first year that Cyrus became king.</p>
<a href="#DAN.2"><h3 id="DAN.2" class="usx-c">2</h3></a>
<p id="s1-DAN.2" class="usx-s1" >What Nebuchadnezzar dreamed</p>
<p id="p-DAN.2" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.2.1"><sup id="DAN.2.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>

    <span id="add-DAN.2.1" class="usx-add">One night</span> during the second year that Nebuchadnezzar ruled, he had a dream. The dream worried him very much; and <span id="add-DAN.2.1" class="usx-add">as a result</span> he could not sleep. <a href="#DAN.2.2"><sup id="DAN.2.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
<span id="add-DAN.2.2" class="usx-add">The next morning </span> he summoned his men who worked magic, fortune-tellers, those who worked sorcery, and those who studied the stars. <span id="add-DAN.2.2" class="usx-add">Because he had forgotten what he had dreamed,</span> he insisted that they tell him what he had dreamed. As they stood there in front of the king, <a href="#DAN.2.3"><sup id="DAN.2.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
he said, “I had a dream <span id="add-DAN.2.3" class="usx-add">last night </span> that worries me. <span id="add-DAN.2.3" class="usx-add">Tell me what I dreamed, because</span> I want to know what the dream <span id="add-DAN.2.3" class="usx-add">means</span>.”</p>
<p id="p-DAN.2.3" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.2.4"><sup id="DAN.2.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
The men who studied the stars replied to the king, speaking in the Aramaic <span id="add-DAN.2.4" class="usx-add">language</span>. They said, “King Nebuchadnezzar, we hope that you will live a long time! Tell us what you dreamed, and <span id="add-DAN.2.4" class="usx-add">then</span> we will tell you what it means!”</p>
<p id="p-DAN.2.4" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.2.5"><sup id="DAN.2.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
But the king replied, “I have firmly decided that you must tell me the dream, and <span id="add-DAN.2.5" class="usx-add">also tell me</span> what it means. If you do not do that, I will <span id="add-DAN.2.5" class="usx-add">order my soldiers to</span> cut you into pieces, and to cause your houses to become only piles of stones! <a href="#DAN.2.6"><sup id="DAN.2.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
But if you tell me what I dreamed and what it means, I will reward you. I will give you wonderful gifts and greatly honor you. So tell me what I dreamed and what it means!”</p>
<p id="p-DAN.2.6" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.2.7"><sup id="DAN.2.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
But again they said, “Tell us what you dreamed, and <span id="add-DAN.2.7" class="usx-add">then</span> we will tell you what it means.”</p>
<p id="p-DAN.2.7" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.2.8"><sup id="DAN.2.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
The king replied, “I know that you are just trying to get more time, because you know that I will do to you what I said that I would do. <a href="#DAN.2.9"><sup id="DAN.2.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
If you do not tell me what I dreamed, you will be punished. <span id="add-DAN.2.9" class="usx-add">I think that</span> you have all agreed to tell me lies and <span id="add-DAN.2.9" class="usx-add">other</span> wicked things, because you hope that I will change ◄<span id="add-DAN.2.9" class="usx-add">my mind/what I am thinking</span>►. But tell me the dream, and <span id="add-DAN.2.9" class="usx-add">then</span> I will know that you can <span id="add-DAN.2.9" class="usx-add">also</span> tell me what it means.”</p>
<p id="p-DAN.2.9" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.2.10"><sup id="DAN.2.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
The men who studied the stars replied, “There is no one on the earth who can do what you ask! There is no king, <span id="add-DAN.2.10" class="usx-add">even</span> a great and mighty king, who has <span id="add-DAN.2.10" class="usx-add">ever</span> asked his men who work magic or his fortune-tellers or men who study the stars to do something like that! <a href="#DAN.2.11"><sup id="DAN.2.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
What you are asking <span id="add-DAN.2.11" class="usx-add">us to do</span> is impossible. Only the gods can tell you what you dreamed, and they do not live among us!”</p>
<p id="p-DAN.2.11" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.2.12"><sup id="DAN.2.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
The king was very angry when he heard that, so he commanded <span id="add-DAN.2.12" class="usx-add">his soldiers</span> that they execute all such wise men in Babylon. <a href="#DAN.2.13"><sup id="DAN.2.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
And because of what the king commanded, they sent some men to find me and my <span id="add-DAN.2.13" class="usx-add">three</span> friends, to execute us <span id="add-DAN.2.13" class="usx-add">also</span>.</p>
<p id="p-DAN.2.13" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.2.14"><sup id="DAN.2.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
Arioch, the commander of the king’s guards, came to kill us. But I spoke to him very wisely and tactfully/skillfully. <a href="#DAN.2.15"><sup id="DAN.2.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
I asked Arioch, “Why has the king made such a harsh/terrible decree?” So Arioch told me all that had happened <span id="add-DAN.2.15" class="usx-add">because of the king’s dream</span>. <a href="#DAN.2.16"><sup id="DAN.2.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
I <span id="add-DAN.2.16" class="usx-add">immediately</span> went to talk to the king and requested that the king give me some time, so that I could find out <span id="add-DAN.2.16" class="usx-add">what the dream was and </span> what the dream meant.</p>
<p id="p-DAN.2.16" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.2.17"><sup id="DAN.2.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
Then I went home, and I told my friends, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, what had happened. <a href="#DAN.2.18"><sup id="DAN.2.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
I urged them to ask God, who lives/rules in heaven, to have mercy on us by telling us the secret <span id="add-DAN.2.18" class="usx-add">meaning of what the king dreamed</span>, in order that we and the other wise men in Babylon would not be executed. <a href="#DAN.2.19"><sup id="DAN.2.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
And that night <span id="add-DAN.2.19" class="usx-add">God</span> gave to me a vision in which he revealed the secret. Then I praised God, <a href="#DAN.2.20"><sup id="DAN.2.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
saying,</p>
<p id="q1-DAN.2.20" class="usx-q1" >“We should praise God [MTY] forever,</p>
<p id="q2-DAN.2.20" class="usx-q2" >because <span id="add-DAN.2.20" class="usx-add">only</span> he truly is wise and powerful.</p>

<p id="q1-DAN.2.21" class="usx-q1" >
    <a href="#DAN.2.22"><sup id="DAN.2.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
He reveals things that are very mysterious;</p>
<p id="q1-DAN.2.22" class="usx-q1" >he is surrounded by light,</p>
<p id="q2-DAN.2.22" class="usx-q2" >but he knows things that are hidden <span id="add-DAN.2.22" class="usx-add">as though they were</span> in the darkness.</p>
<p id="q1-DAN.2.22" class="usx-q1" >
    <a href="#DAN.2.23"><sup id="DAN.2.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
God, whom my ancestors <span id="add-DAN.2.23" class="usx-add">worshiped</span>,</p>
<p id="q1-DAN.2.23" class="usx-q1" >I thank you and I praise you,</p>

<p id="s1-DAN.2.23" class="usx-s1" >Daniel told the meaning of the dream</p>
<p id="p-DAN.2.23" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.2.24"><sup id="DAN.2.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
Then I went to Arioch, the man whom the king had appointed to execute the wise men in Babylon. I said to him, “Do not kill those wise men. Take me to the king, and I will tell him what his dream means.”</p>
<p id="p-DAN.2.24" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.2.25"><sup id="DAN.2.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
So Arioch quickly took me to the king. He said to the king, “I have found <span id="add-DAN.2.25" class="usx-add">this man</span>, one of the men whom we brought from Judah who <span id="add-DAN.2.25" class="usx-add">says he can</span> can tell you what your dream means!”</p>
<p id="p-DAN.2.25" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.2.26"><sup id="DAN.2.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
The king said to me, whose <span id="add-DAN.2.26" class="usx-add">new</span> name was Belteshazzar, “<span id="add-DAN.2.26" class="usx-add">Is this true</span>? Can you tell me what I dreamed and what it means?”</p>
<p id="p-DAN.2.26" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.2.27"><sup id="DAN.2.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
I replied, “There are no wise men or fortune-tellers or men who work magic or men who work sorcery who can tell such things to you. <a href="#DAN.2.28"><sup id="DAN.2.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
But there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets. And he has shown in <span id="add-DAN.2.28" class="usx-add">your dream</span> what will happen in the future. Now I will tell you what you dreamed, the vision you saw <span id="add-DAN.2.28" class="usx-add">as you were lying</span> on your bed.</p>

    <a href="#DAN.2.29"><sup id="DAN.2.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>
O King, while you were sleeping, you dreamed about events that will happen in the future. The one who reveals mysteries has shown you what is going to happen. <a href="#DAN.2.30"><sup id="DAN.2.30" class="usx-v">30</sup></a>
And it is not because I am wiser than anyone else on earth that I know the meaning of this mysterious dream. It is because God wanted you to understand what you were thinking.</p>
<p id="p-DAN.2.30" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.2.31"><sup id="DAN.2.31" class="usx-v">31</sup></a>
O King, <span id="add-DAN.2.31" class="usx-add">in your vision</span> you saw in front of you a huge and terrifying statue <span id="add-DAN.2.31" class="usx-add">of a man.

The head of the statue was <span id="add-DAN.2.32" class="usx-add">made</span> of pure gold. Its chest and arms <span id="add-DAN.2.32" class="usx-add">were made of</span> silver.

Then the rest of the statue collapsed into a big heap of iron, clay, bronze, silver, and gold. The pieces of the statue were as small as bits of chaff on the ground where it is threshed, and the wind blew away all the tiny pieces. There was nothing left. But the rock that smashed the statue became a large mountain that covered the whole earth.</p>

    <a href="#DAN.2.36"><sup id="DAN.2.36" class="usx-v">36</sup></a>
That was what you dreamed. Now I will tell you what it means. <a href="#DAN.2.37"><sup id="DAN.2.37" class="usx-v">37</sup></a>
You are a king <span id="add-DAN.2.37" class="usx-add">who rules</span> over <span id="add-DAN.2.37" class="usx-add">many other</span> kings. The God who rules in heaven has caused you to rule over them and has given you great power [DOU] and has honored you. <a href="#DAN.2.38"><sup id="DAN.2.38" class="usx-v">38</sup></a>
He has caused you to be the ruler over all people, and <span id="add-DAN.2.38" class="usx-add">even</span> the animals and birds are controlled by you. <span id="add-DAN.2.38" class="usx-add">So</span> the head <span id="add-DAN.2.38" class="usx-add">of the statue</span> represents you.</p>
<p id="p-DAN.2.38" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.2.39"><sup id="DAN.2.39" class="usx-v">39</sup></a>
But after your <span id="add-DAN.2.39" class="usx-add">kingdom/rule</span> ends, there will be another <span id="add-DAN.2.39" class="usx-add">great</span> kingdom, <span id="add-DAN.2.39" class="usx-add">but it</span> will not be as great as yours. <span id="add-DAN.2.39" class="usx-add">The silver parts of the statue represent that kingdom</span>. Then there will be a third <span id="add-DAN.2.39" class="usx-add">great</span> kingdom <span id="add-DAN.2.39" class="usx-add">whose king </span> will rule over the whole earth. The bronze parts <span id="add-DAN.2.39" class="usx-add">of the statue represent </span> that kingdom. <a href="#DAN.2.40"><sup id="DAN.2.40" class="usx-v">40</sup></a>
After that kingdom ends, there will be a fourth <span id="add-DAN.2.40" class="usx-add">great</span> kingdom. The iron <span id="add-DAN.2.40" class="usx-add">parts of the statue represent that kingdom</span>. <span id="add-DAN.2.40" class="usx-add">The army of </span> that kingdom will smash the previous kingdoms, just like iron smashes everything that it strikes. <a href="#DAN.2.41"><sup id="DAN.2.41" class="usx-v">41</sup></a>
The feet and toes of the statue that you saw, that were a mixture of iron and clay, indicate that the kingdom they represent will <span id="add-DAN.2.41" class="usx-add">later</span> be divided. <a href="#DAN.2.42"><sup id="DAN.2.42" class="usx-v">42</sup></a>
Some parts of that kingdom will be as strong as iron, but some parts will not remain together, just as iron and clay do not stick together. <a href="#DAN.2.43"><sup id="DAN.2.43" class="usx-v">43</sup></a>
The mixture of iron and clay <span id="add-DAN.2.43" class="usx-add">in the statue</span> shows also that the rulers of those kingdoms that separate from each other will try to form alliances with each other as a result of members of the royal families of those kingdoms marrying each other. But that will not succeed, just as iron and clay do not stick together.</p>
<p id="p-DAN.2.43" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.2.44"><sup id="DAN.2.44" class="usx-v">44</sup></a>
But while those kings are ruling, God who rules in heaven will establish a kingdom that will never end. No one will ever defeat its king. He will completely destroy all those kingdoms, but his kingdom will remain forever. <a href="#DAN.2.45"><sup id="DAN.2.45" class="usx-v">45</sup></a>
That is the meaning of the rock that something cut from the mountain, the rock that will crush to tiny bits the statue that is made of iron, bronze, silver, and gold.</p>
<p id="p-DAN.2.45" class="usx-p" >O king, the great God has shown you what will truly happen in the future. And you can trust <span id="add-DAN.2.45" class="usx-add">what I told you about</span> the meaning of the dream.”</p>

There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods in him. When Nebuchadnezzar was ruling, they discovered that this man understood many things and was wise, just like the gods.

That man’s name is Daniel; the king gave him a <span id="add-DAN.5.12" class="usx-add">new</span> name, Belteshazzar. He is very intelligent and is able to know and understand many things. He is <span id="add-DAN.5.12" class="usx-add">even</span> able to tell the meaning of dreams, and explain riddles, and explain things that are very difficult to understand.

I soon showed that I was ◄more capable/able to do the work better► than all the other administrators and the governors. Because of that, the king planned to appoint me to be in charge of the entire empire. <a href="#DAN.6.4"><sup id="DAN.6.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
Then, the <span id="add-DAN.6.4" class="usx-add">other</span> administrators and the governors <span id="add-DAN.6.4" class="usx-add">became jealous. So they began to</span> try to find something that they could criticize about the way I was working for the king. But I always did my work faithfully and honestly, and was never lazy. So they could not find anything to criticize. <a href="#DAN.6.5"><sup id="DAN.6.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
They concluded, “The only way we can find something for which we can criticize Daniel will be something concerning the laws that his god <span id="add-DAN.6.5" class="usx-add">his given him</span>.”</p>
<p id="p-DAN.6.5" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.6.6"><sup id="DAN.6.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
So the administrators and governors went as one group to the king and said, “◄Your Majesty/O king►, we wish that you will live a long time! <a href="#DAN.6.7"><sup id="DAN.6.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
<span id="add-DAN.6.7" class="usx-add">We</span> administrators and governors and district governors and advisors and other officials have all agreed that you should make a law that everyone must obey. We want you to command that for the next thirty days people may pray only to you. If anyone prays to anyone else, either to a human or to a god, he must be thrown into <span id="add-DAN.6.7" class="usx-add">a pit of </span> lions. <a href="#DAN.6.8"><sup id="DAN.6.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
And because laws made by <span id="add-DAN.6.8" class="usx-add">our governments of</span> Media and Persia cannot be changed, <span id="add-DAN.6.8" class="usx-add">we want</span> you, <span id="add-DAN.6.8" class="usx-add">the head of our government</span>, to sign it.” <a href="#DAN.6.9"><sup id="DAN.6.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
So King Darius <span id="add-DAN.6.9" class="usx-add">wrote</span> the law and signed it.</p>
<p id="p-DAN.6.9" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.6.10"><sup id="DAN.6.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
But when I found out that <span id="add-DAN.6.10" class="usx-add">the king</span> had <span id="add-DAN.6.10" class="usx-add">written and</span> signed that law, I went home. I knelt down in my upstairs room and prayed. I looked toward Jerusalem, and the windows were open <span id="add-DAN.6.10" class="usx-add">with the result that everyone could see me while I was praying</span>. I prayed three times each day, just as I always did, thanking God. <a href="#DAN.6.11"><sup id="DAN.6.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
The officials went together <span id="add-DAN.6.11" class="usx-add">to my house</span> and they saw me praying and requesting God to help me. <a href="#DAN.6.12"><sup id="DAN.6.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
So they returned to the king and said to him, “<span id="add-DAN.6.12" class="usx-add">Do you remember</span> that you wrote a law stating that for the next thirty days people may pray only to you, and if anyone prays to anyone else, either to a human or to a god, he will be thrown into <span id="add-DAN.6.12" class="usx-add">a pit of</span> lions?”</p>
<p id="p-DAN.6.12" class="usx-p" >The king replied, “<span id="add-DAN.6.12" class="usx-add">Yes, that is the law that I wrote</span>. It is a law of <span id="add-DAN.6.12" class="usx-add">our governments of</span> Media and Persia, which cannot be canceled.”</p>
<p id="p-DAN.6.12" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.6.13"><sup id="DAN.6.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Then they said to the king, “Well, that <span id="add-DAN.6.13" class="usx-add">man</span> Daniel, one of the men who were brought from Judah, is not paying any attention to you or the law that you <span id="add-DAN.6.13" class="usx-add">signed</span>. He prays <span id="add-DAN.6.13" class="usx-add">to his god</span> three times each day!” <a href="#DAN.6.14"><sup id="DAN.6.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
When the king heard that, he was very distressed. He tried to find a way to save me. All the rest of that day he tried to think of a way to rescue me.</p>
<p id="p-DAN.6.14" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.6.15"><sup id="DAN.6.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>

    <span id="add-DAN.6.15" class="usx-add">In the evening, many of</span> [HYP] the officials went together to the king and said, “◄Your Majesty/O king►, you know that <span id="add-DAN.6.15" class="usx-add">our governments of</span> Media and Persia have declared that no law that the king signs can be canceled/changed. <span id="add-DAN.6.15" class="usx-add">So Daniel must be thrown to the lions!</span>”</p>
<p id="p-DAN.6.15" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.6.16"><sup id="DAN.6.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
So the king gave the order, and his servants brought me and threw me into a pit where the lions <span id="add-DAN.6.16" class="usx-add">were</span>. <span id="add-DAN.6.16" class="usx-add">Before they threw me in</span>, the king said to me, “I hope/wish that your God, whom you worship regularly, will rescue you!”</p>
<p id="p-DAN.6.16" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.6.17"><sup id="DAN.6.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
They rolled a huge stone across the entrance to the pit. Then the king <span id="add-DAN.6.17" class="usx-add">fastened a string across the entrance and put wax at each end, and stamped the wax with</span> the seal from his <span id="add-DAN.6.17" class="usx-add">ring</span> and the seals <span id="add-DAN.6.17" class="usx-add">of the rings</span> of his officials, in order that no one could <span id="add-DAN.6.17" class="usx-add">secretly</span> rescue me. <a href="#DAN.6.18"><sup id="DAN.6.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
Then the king returned to his palace. That night he refused to eat any food. He would not allow anyone to entertain him <span id="add-DAN.6.18" class="usx-add">because he did not want to be happy, with the result that he would forget about me. And that night </span> he was unable to sleep <span id="add-DAN.6.18" class="usx-add">because he was worried about me</span>.</p>
<p id="p-DAN.6.18" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.6.19"><sup id="DAN.6.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
At dawn the next morning, the king got up and went quickly to the pit where the lions were. <a href="#DAN.6.20"><sup id="DAN.6.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
When he came near it, he was very worried. He called out, “Daniel, you who serve the all-powerful God! Was your God, whom you worship regularly, able to save you from the lions?”</p>
<p id="p-DAN.6.20" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.6.21"><sup id="DAN.6.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
I answered, “◄Your Majesty/O king►, I hope that you will live a long time! <a href="#DAN.6.22"><sup id="DAN.6.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
<span id="add-DAN.6.22" class="usx-add">Yes</span>, my God sent his angel to shut the lions’ mouths, in order that they would not harm me! <span id="add-DAN.6.22" class="usx-add">He did that</span> because <span id="add-DAN.6.22" class="usx-add">he knows that</span> I have done nothing that he thinks is wrong. And, ◄Your Majesty/O king►, I never did anything wrong to you!”</p>
<p id="p-DAN.6.22" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.6.23"><sup id="DAN.6.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
The king was extremely happy, and he commanded <span id="add-DAN.6.23" class="usx-add">his servants</span> to lift me out of the pit. <span id="add-DAN.6.23" class="usx-add">When they did that, they</span> saw that the lions had not wounded me at all. <span id="add-DAN.6.23" class="usx-add">God had protected me</span> because I trusted in him.</p>
<p id="p-DAN.6.23" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.6.24"><sup id="DAN.6.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
Then the king commanded that the men who had accused me should be seized and be thrown, along with their wives and children, into the pit where the lions were. <span id="add-DAN.6.24" class="usx-add">When they were thrown into the pit</span>, the lions leaped on them and crushed their bones before they fell onto the bottom of the pit!</p>
<p id="p-DAN.6.24" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.6.25"><sup id="DAN.6.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
Then King Darius wrote <span id="add-DAN.6.25" class="usx-add">this message and sent it throughout his kingdom</span> to the people of every people-group and nation and from all language groups:</p>
<p id="b-DAN.6.25" class="usx-b" ></p>
<p id="pi1-DAN.6.25" class="usx-pi1" >“I wish/hope that everything is going very well with you!</p>
<p id="pi1-DAN.6.25" class="usx-pi1" >
    <a href="#DAN.6.26"><sup id="DAN.6.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
I command that everyone in my kingdom should fear and revere the God that Daniel <span id="add-DAN.6.26" class="usx-add">worships</span>.</p>
<p id="q1-DAN.6.26" class="usx-q1" >He is the all-powerful God,</p>

    <a href="#DAN.6.27"><sup id="DAN.6.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
He rescues and saves <span id="add-DAN.6.27" class="usx-add">his people</span>.</p>

<p id="q1-DAN.6.27" class="usx-q1" >He rescued Daniel from the power of the lions!”</p>
<p id="p-DAN.6.27" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.6.28"><sup id="DAN.6.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
So I was successful <span id="add-DAN.6.28" class="usx-add">all</span> during the time that Darius ruled and during the time that Cyrus, <span id="add-DAN.6.28" class="usx-add">the King</span> of Persia, ruled.</p>
<a href="#DAN.7"><h3 id="DAN.7" class="usx-c">7</h3></a>
<p id="s1-DAN.7" class="usx-s1" >Daniel dreamed about four beasts</p>
<p id="p-DAN.7" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.7.1"><sup id="DAN.7.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>

    <span id="add-DAN.7.1" class="usx-add">Previously,</span> during the first year that Belshazzar was the king of Babylonia, I had a dream and a vision one night as I lay on my bed. <span id="add-DAN.7.1" class="usx-add">The next morning</span> I wrote down what I had dreamed. This is what I wrote:</p>
<p id="p-DAN.7.1" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.7.2"><sup id="DAN.7.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
I, Daniel, had a vision last night. In the vision I saw that strong winds were blowing from all four directions, stirring up <span id="add-DAN.7.2" class="usx-add">the water in</span> the ocean. <a href="#DAN.7.3"><sup id="DAN.7.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
Then <span id="add-DAN.7.3" class="usx-add">I saw</span> four beasts coming out of the ocean. All four of them were different.</p>
<p id="p-DAN.7.3" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.7.4"><sup id="DAN.7.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
The first one resembled a lion, but it had wings like an eagle has. But as I watched, something tore off its wings {its wings were pulled off}. The beast was left there, standing on its two hind/rear legs, like a human being stands. And it was given a mind like humans have.</p>
<p id="p-DAN.7.4" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.7.5"><sup id="DAN.7.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
The second beast resembled a bear. It was crouching, and it held between its teeth three ribs <span id="add-DAN.7.5" class="usx-add">from another animal that it had killed and eaten</span>. Someone said to it {It was told}, “Stand up and eat as much meat <span id="add-DAN.7.5" class="usx-add">as you want</span>!”</p>
<p id="p-DAN.7.5" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.7.6"><sup id="DAN.7.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
Then I saw in front of me the third of those beasts. It resembled a leopard, but it had four wings protruding from its back. The wings were like a bird’s wings. It had four heads. It was given the power/authority to rule <span id="add-DAN.7.6" class="usx-add">people</span>.</p>
<p id="p-DAN.7.6" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.7.7"><sup id="DAN.7.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
In the vision I saw a fourth beast. It was stronger than the other beasts, and it was more terrifying. It crushed other creatures with its huge iron teeth and ate their flesh. The parts of animals that it did not grind with its teeth, it trampled <span id="add-DAN.7.7" class="usx-add">on the ground</span>. It was different from the other three beasts: It had ten horns <span id="add-DAN.7.7" class="usx-add">on its head</span>.</p>
<p id="p-DAN.7.7" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.7.8"><sup id="DAN.7.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
While I was looking at those horns, I saw a little horn appear <span id="add-DAN.7.8" class="usx-add">on the head of that beast</span>. It tore out three of the other horns. This little horn had eyes like humans have, and it had a mouth <span id="add-DAN.7.8" class="usx-add">with which it spoke</span> very boastfully.</p>
<p id="p-DAN.7.8" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.7.9"><sup id="DAN.7.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>

    <span id="add-DAN.7.9" class="usx-add">Then</span> while I watched,</p>

    <a href="#DAN.7.10"><sup id="DAN.7.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
A fire was rushing out of in front of him like a stream.</p>

    <a href="#DAN.7.11"><sup id="DAN.7.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
While I was watching, I could hear the little horn speaking very boastfully. As I <span id="add-DAN.7.11" class="usx-add">continued to</span> watch, the <span id="add-DAN.7.11" class="usx-add">fourth</span> beast was killed.

The power/authority of the other <span id="add-DAN.7.12" class="usx-add">three</span> beasts was taken away from them, but they were allowed to continue to live for a while.</p>

While I <span id="add-DAN.7.13" class="usx-add">continued to</span> see the vision that night, I saw someone who resembled a human being.

He was honored and given great authority to rule over all the nations in the world, in order that people from every people-group and every nation, people from all language groups, would worship/serve him.

<p id="s1-DAN.7.14" class="usx-s1" >The explanation of the vision</p>
<p id="p-DAN.7.14" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.7.15"><sup id="DAN.7.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
As for me, Daniel, I was very terrified by what I had seen in that vision, and I did not know what to think about it. <a href="#DAN.7.16"><sup id="DAN.7.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
I went to one of those who were standing in front of the throne of God, and I asked him to tell me what it meant. So he told me the meaning of it.</p>
<p id="p-DAN.7.16" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.7.17"><sup id="DAN.7.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>

    <span id="add-DAN.7.17" class="usx-add">He said</span>, “The four huge beasts represent four kingdoms/empires that will exist on the earth. <a href="#DAN.7.18"><sup id="DAN.7.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>

    <a href="#DAN.7.19"><sup id="DAN.7.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
Then I wanted to know what the fourth beast signified—<span id="add-DAN.7.19" class="usx-add">the beast</span> that was different from the other three, the beast that crushed <span id="add-DAN.7.19" class="usx-add">those that it attacked</span> with its bronze claws, and <span id="add-DAN.7.19" class="usx-add">then</span> ate <span id="add-DAN.7.19" class="usx-add">their flesh</span> with its iron teeth, and trampled on the parts of their bodies <span id="add-DAN.7.19" class="usx-add">that it did not eat</span>. <a href="#DAN.7.20"><sup id="DAN.7.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>

While I was having the vision, I saw that this horn attacked God’s people and was defeating them. <a href="#DAN.7.22"><sup id="DAN.7.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
But then the Supreme God, the one who had been living forever, came and judged in favor of the people who belonged to him. And <span id="add-DAN.7.22" class="usx-add">I knew that</span> it was time for God’s people to receive authority <span id="add-DAN.7.22" class="usx-add">to rule</span>.</p>

<p id="s1-DAN.8" class="usx-s1" >Daniel’s vision of a ram and a goat</p>
<p id="p-DAN.8" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.8.1"><sup id="DAN.8.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
During the third year that Belshazzar was the King <span id="add-DAN.8.1" class="usx-add">of Babylonia</span>, I had another vision. <a href="#DAN.8.2"><sup id="DAN.8.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
In that vision I was in Susa, the capital city of Elam Province. I was <span id="add-DAN.8.2" class="usx-add">standing</span> alongside the Ulai Canal. <a href="#DAN.8.3"><sup id="DAN.8.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
I looked up and saw a ram that was standing alongside the canal. It had two <span id="add-DAN.8.3" class="usx-add">long</span> horns, but the newest one was longer than the other one. <a href="#DAN.8.4"><sup id="DAN.8.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
The ram butted/knocked away <span id="add-DAN.8.4" class="usx-add">with its horns</span> everything that was west and everything that was north and everything that was south of it. There were no <span id="add-DAN.8.4" class="usx-add">other</span> animals that were able to oppose it, and none that could rescue/save <span id="add-DAN.8.4" class="usx-add">other animals</span> from its power. The ram did whatever it wanted to do and became very powerful.</p>
<p id="p-DAN.8.4" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.8.5"><sup id="DAN.8.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
While I was thinking <span id="add-DAN.8.5" class="usx-add">about what I had seen, in the vision</span> I saw a goat come from the west. It ran across the land so quickly, that <span id="add-DAN.8.5" class="usx-add">it seemed like</span> its feet did not touch the ground. This goat had one very large horn between its eyes. <a href="#DAN.8.6"><sup id="DAN.8.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
It was very angry, and it ran <span id="add-DAN.8.6" class="usx-add">straight</span> toward the ram that I had seen <span id="add-DAN.8.6" class="usx-add">previously, the ram</span> that was standing alongside the canal. <a href="#DAN.8.7"><sup id="DAN.8.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
The goat struck the ram furiously and broke off its two horns, with the result that the ram was unable <span id="add-DAN.8.7" class="usx-add">to defend itself</span>. <span id="add-DAN.8.7" class="usx-add">So</span> the goat knocked the ram down and trampled on it. No one could rescue the ram from the goat’s power. <a href="#DAN.8.8"><sup id="DAN.8.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
The goat became very powerful. But when its power was very great, its horn was broken off. But four <span id="add-DAN.8.8" class="usx-add">other</span> large horns took its place. They each pointed in a different direction.</p>
<p id="p-DAN.8.8" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.8.9"><sup id="DAN.8.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>

    <span id="add-DAN.8.9" class="usx-add">Then</span> from one of those <span id="add-DAN.8.9" class="usx-add">large horns</span> appeared a little horn, which became very big, <span id="add-DAN.8.9" class="usx-add">and pointed</span> toward the south and <span id="add-DAN.8.9" class="usx-add">then</span> toward the east and <span id="add-DAN.8.9" class="usx-add">then</span> toward the beautiful land <span id="add-DAN.8.9" class="usx-add">of Israel</span>. <a href="#DAN.8.10"><sup id="DAN.8.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
<span id="add-DAN.8.10" class="usx-add">The man who was represented by</span> that horn became very strong, with the result that he attacked some of the <span id="add-DAN.8.10" class="usx-add">soldiers of the</span> army of heaven, and (OR, meaning) the stars in the sky <span id="add-DAN.8.10" class="usx-add">which represented God’s people</span>. He threw some of them to the ground and trampled on them. <a href="#DAN.8.11"><sup id="DAN.8.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
He ◄defied/considered himself to be greater than► the leader of the army <span id="add-DAN.8.11" class="usx-add">of heaven</span>, and prevented <span id="add-DAN.8.11" class="usx-add">priests from</span> offering sacrifices to him. He also ◄defiled the temple/caused the temple to become unholy►. <a href="#DAN.8.12"><sup id="DAN.8.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
Then God’s people allowed the <span id="add-DAN.8.12" class="usx-add">man who was represented by</span> that horn to control/rule them, with the result that they sinned by offering sacrifices to him. And he threw to the ground the <span id="add-DAN.8.12" class="usx-add">laws that contained the</span> true religion. Everything that he did was successful.</p>
<p id="p-DAN.8.12" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.8.13"><sup id="DAN.8.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Then I heard two angels who were talking to each other. One of them asked, “How long will the things/events that were in this vision continue? How long will the man who rebels against God and causes <span id="add-DAN.8.13" class="usx-add">the temple</span> to be defiled be able to prevent <span id="add-DAN.8.13" class="usx-add">priests from</span> offering sacrifices? How long will he trample on the temple and on the armies of heaven?”</p>
<p id="p-DAN.8.13" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.8.14"><sup id="DAN.8.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
The other angel replied, “<span id="add-DAN.8.14" class="usx-add">It will continue</span> for 1,150 days. During all of that time, <span id="add-DAN.8.14" class="usx-add">people will not be permitted to offer sacrifices</span> in the morning or in the evening. After that, the temple will be purified.”</p>
<p id="s1-DAN.8.14" class="usx-s1" >Gabriel explained the vision</p>
<p id="p-DAN.8.14" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.8.15"><sup id="DAN.8.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
While I, Daniel, was trying to understand what the vision meant, suddenly <span id="add-DAN.8.15" class="usx-add">an angel</span> who resembled a man stood/appeared in front of me. <a href="#DAN.8.16"><sup id="DAN.8.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
And I heard a man call out from <span id="add-DAN.8.16" class="usx-add">the other side of</span> the Ulai Canal, saying, “Gabriel, explain to him the meaning of the vision <span id="add-DAN.8.16" class="usx-add">that he saw</span>!”</p>
<p id="p-DAN.8.16" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.8.17"><sup id="DAN.8.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
So Gabriel came and stood beside me. I was very terrified, with the result that I fell onto the ground. But he said to me, “You human, it is necessary for you to understand that <span id="add-DAN.8.17" class="usx-add">the events that you saw in</span> the vision will occur <span id="add-DAN.8.17" class="usx-add">near</span> the time that <span id="add-DAN.8.17" class="usx-add">the world</span> will end.”</p>
<p id="p-DAN.8.17" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.8.18"><sup id="DAN.8.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
While he was speaking, I fainted. I lay there, unconscious, with my face still on the ground. But Gabriel put his hand on me and lifted me up in order that I could stand again.</p>
<p id="p-DAN.8.18" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.8.19"><sup id="DAN.8.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
Then he said, “I <span id="add-DAN.8.19" class="usx-add">have come here to</span> tell you what will happen because of <span id="add-DAN.8.19" class="usx-add">God</span> being angry. These things will happen near the time when <span id="add-DAN.8.19" class="usx-add">the world</span> will end. <a href="#DAN.8.20"><sup id="DAN.8.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
As for the ram with two horns that you saw, those horns <span id="add-DAN.8.20" class="usx-add">represent</span> the kingdoms of Media and Persia. <a href="#DAN.8.21"><sup id="DAN.8.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
The goat <span id="add-DAN.8.21" class="usx-add">that you saw represents</span> the kingdom of Greece, and the horn that appeared between its eyes <span id="add-DAN.8.21" class="usx-add">represents</span> its first king. <a href="#DAN.8.22"><sup id="DAN.8.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
As for the four horns that grew after the first horn was broken off, they <span id="add-DAN.8.22" class="usx-add">represent</span> four kingdoms into which that first kingdom will be divided <span id="add-DAN.8.22" class="usx-add">after the first king dies</span>. Those four kingdoms will not be as strong/powerful as the first kingdom was.</p>
<p id="p-DAN.8.22" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.8.23"><sup id="DAN.8.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
The people <span id="add-DAN.8.23" class="usx-add">in those kingdoms</span> will become very wicked, with the result that it will be necessary for them to be punished. But near the time when those kingdoms will end, one of those kingdoms will have a king who will be very proud/defiant [IDM]. He will <span id="add-DAN.8.23" class="usx-add">also</span> be very fierce and very deceitful. <a href="#DAN.8.24"><sup id="DAN.8.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
He will become very powerful, but it will not be because of what he himself does. He will terribly destroy things in many places, and he will succeed in doing everything that he wants to. He will get rid of <span id="add-DAN.8.24" class="usx-add">many</span> powerful men, and <span id="add-DAN.8.24" class="usx-add">also</span> some of God’s people. <a href="#DAN.8.25"><sup id="DAN.8.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
Because he is very cunning/clever, he will succeed by doing things that deceive many people. He will be proud of himself. He will destroy many people when they think that they are safe. He will also rebel against <span id="add-DAN.8.25" class="usx-add">God</span> [EUP], who is the greatest king. But <span id="add-DAN.8.25" class="usx-add">God</span> will destroy him, without the help [MTY] of any human being.</p>
<p id="p-DAN.8.25" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.8.26"><sup id="DAN.8.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
What you saw in the vision about <span id="add-DAN.8.26" class="usx-add">priests being prevented from making</span> sacrifices in the morning and in the evening, which <span id="add-DAN.8.26" class="usx-add">I</span> explained <span id="add-DAN.8.26" class="usx-add">to you</span>, will surely happen. But <span id="add-DAN.8.26" class="usx-add">for the present time</span>, do not reveal the vision <span id="add-DAN.8.26" class="usx-add">to others</span>, because it will be many years before those things happen.”</p>
<p id="p-DAN.8.26" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#DAN.8.27"><sup id="DAN.8.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
Then I, Daniel, became weak, and I was sick for several days. Then I arose and <span id="add-DAN.8.27" class="usx-add">returned to</span> doing the work that the king <span id="add-DAN.8.27" class="usx-add">had given to me</span>, but I was perplexed/confused about the vision, and I could not understand it.</p>

Some of those wise leaders will be killed [EUP], but as a result the others will be purified [DOU]. This suffering will continue until it is the time <span id="add-DAN.11.35" class="usx-add">that God</span> has appointed <span id="add-DAN.11.35" class="usx-add">for it to</span> end.</p>

The King <span id="add-DAN.11.36" class="usx-add">of Syria</span> will do what he wants to. He will boast and say that he is greater than any god. He will even revile the Supreme God. He will be able to do what he wants until the time that <span id="add-DAN.11.36" class="usx-add">God</span> punishes [MTY] him. <span id="add-DAN.11.36" class="usx-add">God</span> will accomplish what he has planned. <a href="#DAN.11.37"><sup id="DAN.11.37" class="usx-v">37</sup></a>
The <span id="add-DAN.11.37" class="usx-add">King of Syria</span> will ignore the god that his ancestors worshiped and the god that many women love. He will ignore every god, because he will think that he is greater than all of them. <a href="#DAN.11.38"><sup id="DAN.11.38" class="usx-v">38</sup></a>
But he will honor the god who <span id="add-DAN.11.38" class="usx-add">people think</span> protects fortresses. That is a god whom his ancestors did not honor. And he will give gold, silver, ◄jewels/very valuable stones► and other expensive gifts to that god. <a href="#DAN.11.39"><sup id="DAN.11.39" class="usx-v">39</sup></a>
He will ask that god (OR, people who worship a god) from another country to help him to defend his fortresses. He will greatly honor those who allow him <span id="add-DAN.11.39" class="usx-add">to be their ruler</span>. He will appoint <span id="add-DAN.11.39" class="usx-add">some of</span> them to important positions in the government; and to reward them, he will give them some land.</p>

But when his time <span id="add-DAN.11.40" class="usx-add">to rule</span> is almost ended, <span id="add-DAN.11.40" class="usx-add">the army of</span> the King of Egypt will attack his <span id="add-DAN.11.40" class="usx-add">army</span>. The <span id="add-DAN.11.40" class="usx-add">army of the</span> King of Syria will fight against them furiously [SIM]. <span id="add-DAN.11.40" class="usx-add">His soldiers will be driving</span> chariots and <span id="add-DAN.11.40" class="usx-add">riding on</span> horses and <span id="add-DAN.11.40" class="usx-add">traveling in</span> many ships.

They will invade the glorious land <span id="add-DAN.11.41" class="usx-add">of Israel</span> and kill [EUP] tens of thousands of people.

When the army of Syria invades other countries, even the people of Egypt will be defeated. <a href="#DAN.11.43"><sup id="DAN.11.43" class="usx-v">43</sup></a>
The army of Syria will take away from Egypt gold, silver, and other valuable items. The people of Libya and Ethiopia will allow <span id="add-DAN.11.43" class="usx-add">the King of Syria</span> to rule over them. <a href="#DAN.11.44"><sup id="DAN.11.44" class="usx-v">44</sup></a>
But he will become very frightened/alarmed when he hears reports about what is happening in the east and in the north.

Many people will thoroughly purify their inner beings [DOU]. But wicked people will not understand these things. They will continue to be wicked.
