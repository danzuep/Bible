    <span id="add-EZK.1.1-2" class="usx-add">I am</span> Ezekiel, a priest, the son of Buzi. When I was 30 years <span id="add-EZK.1.1-2" class="usx-add">old</span>, I was<span id="add-EZK.1.1-2" class="usx-add">living</span> among the<span id="add-EZK.1.1-2" class="usx-add">Israeli</span> people who had been ◄exiled from/forced to leave► Judah<span id="add-EZK.1.1-2" class="usx-add">and had come to Babylon</span>. I was living along the Kebar River/Canal<span id="add-EZK.1.1-2" class="usx-add">south of Babylon</span>. Almost five years after King Jehoiachin had been ◄exiled/forced to leave Judah►, on the fifth day of the fourth month<span id="add-EZK.1.1-2" class="usx-add">of that year, it was as though</span> the sky was opened and I saw visions from God.</p>
<p id="p-EZK.1.1-2" class="usx-p" >On that day, <a href="#EZK.1.3"><sup id="EZK.1.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
God gave me messages<span id="add-EZK.1.3" class="usx-add">in visions here</span> in Babylonia, and I felt the power [MTY] of Yahweh on me.</p>
<p id="p-EZK.1.3" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EZK.1.4"><sup id="EZK.1.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>

    <span id="add-EZK.1.4" class="usx-add">In one of the visions, I saw a</span> windstorm coming from the north. There was a huge cloud, and lightning was flashing continually, and a brilliant light surrounded the cloud. In the center of where the lightning was flashing there was something that resembled glowing bronze. <a href="#EZK.1.5"><sup id="EZK.1.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
In the center of the storm I saw what resembled four living creatures. They resembled humans, <a href="#EZK.1.6"><sup id="EZK.1.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
but each of them had four faces and four wings [DOU]. <a href="#EZK.1.7"><sup id="EZK.1.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Their legs were straight. Their feet resembled the hooves of calves, and the creatures shone like polished bronze. <a href="#EZK.1.8"><sup id="EZK.1.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
On their four sides under their wings there were hands like humans have. <a href="#EZK.1.9"><sup id="EZK.1.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
As the four creatures<span id="add-EZK.1.9" class="usx-add">stood there, they formed a circle/square</span>, with their wings touching each other. They did not turn when they were moving; they went straight ahead.</p>
<p id="p-EZK.1.9" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EZK.1.10"><sup id="EZK.1.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
Each<span id="add-EZK.1.10" class="usx-add">of the creatures had four faces</span>. The face that was in front <span id="add-EZK.1.10" class="usx-add">of each one was a face that </span> resembled a human face. The face on the right side resembled a lion’s face. The face on the left side resembled an ox’s face. The face in back resembled an eagle’s face. <a href="#EZK.1.11"><sup id="EZK.1.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
Two of each creature’s wings were lifted up and touched the wings of the creatures that were on each side. The other two wings were folded against the creature’s body. <a href="#EZK.1.12"><sup id="EZK.1.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
The creatures went straight ahead in whatever direction the spirit<span id="add-EZK.1.12" class="usx-add">that controlled/guided them</span> wanted them to go, without changing directions while they were moving. <a href="#EZK.1.13"><sup id="EZK.1.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
The<span id="add-EZK.1.13" class="usx-add">four</span> creatures resembled burning coals or torches. A blazing fire moved back and forth among the creatures, and lighting flashed from among them. <a href="#EZK.1.14"><sup id="EZK.1.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
The creatures moved back and forth<span id="add-EZK.1.14" class="usx-add">extremely rapidly</span>, like [SIM] flashes of lightning.</p>
<p id="p-EZK.1.14" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EZK.1.15"><sup id="EZK.1.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
While I looked at the four living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each of them. <a href="#EZK.1.16"><sup id="EZK.1.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
Each of the wheels was the same, and they all shone like [SIM] ◄chrysolite/a valuable green stone►. Each seemed to have one wheel inside another wheel. <a href="#EZK.1.17"><sup id="EZK.1.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
Whenever they moved, they would go straight in one of the four directions that they faced; they did not turn<span id="add-EZK.1.17" class="usx-add">in another direction</span> while they moved. <a href="#EZK.1.18"><sup id="EZK.1.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
The rims of the wheels were covered with eyes.</p>
<p id="p-EZK.1.18" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EZK.1.19"><sup id="EZK.1.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
Whenever the living creatures moved, the wheels moved with them. <span id="add-EZK.1.19" class="usx-add">So</span> whenever the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels<span id="add-EZK.1.19" class="usx-add">also</span> rose up. <a href="#EZK.1.20"><sup id="EZK.1.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
Wherever the spirit<span id="add-EZK.1.20" class="usx-add">that controlled the creatures</span> wanted the creatures to go, they went, and the wheels went with them, because the spirit<span id="add-EZK.1.20" class="usx-add">that controlled/guided them</span> was in the wheels [DOU]. <a href="#EZK.1.21"><sup id="EZK.1.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
Whenever the creatures moved, the wheels moved. Whenever the creatures stood<span id="add-EZK.1.21" class="usx-add">still</span>, the wheels stopped. Whenever the creatures rose up from the ground, the wheels rose up with them.</p>
<p id="p-EZK.1.21" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EZK.1.22"><sup id="EZK.1.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
Above the heads of the creatures there was something that resembled a dome. It shone like ice (OR, crystal) shines, and it was awesome. <a href="#EZK.1.23"><sup id="EZK.1.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
Under the dome, the creatures stretched out their wings. Each one had two wings; <span id="add-EZK.1.23" class="usx-add">each wing</span> stretched towards the creature that<span id="add-EZK.1.23" class="usx-add">was next to</span> it, and two wings that were against the creature’s body. <a href="#EZK.1.24"><sup id="EZK.1.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
Whenever the creatures moved, their wings made a sound that resembled the roar made by a rushing stream. It also sounded like the voice of Almighty God, and like [SIM] the noise of a huge army marching. Whenever the creatures stood still<span id="add-EZK.1.24" class="usx-add">on the ground</span>, they lowered their wings.</p>
<p id="p-EZK.1.24" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EZK.1.25"><sup id="EZK.1.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
While they stood<span id="add-EZK.1.25" class="usx-add">on the ground</span> with their wings lowered, there was a voice from the dome that was over their heads. <a href="#EZK.1.26"><sup id="EZK.1.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
Above the dome was something that resembled a<span id="add-EZK.1.26" class="usx-add">huge</span> throne<span id="add-EZK.1.26" class="usx-add">that was made of a huge</span> ◄sapphire/valuable blue stone►. Sitting on the throne was someone that resembled a human. <a href="#EZK.1.27"><sup id="EZK.1.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
I saw that above his waist his body resembled metal that was glowing as though it had<span id="add-EZK.1.27" class="usx-add">a very hot</span> fire inside it. And I saw that below his waist there was a very brilliant light that surrounded him. <a href="#EZK.1.28"><sup id="EZK.1.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
It<span id="add-EZK.1.28" class="usx-add">shone</span> like [SIM] a rainbow shines in the clouds on a rainy day.</p>
<p id="p-EZK.1.28" class="usx-p" >That was the brilliant light that represented the presence of Yahweh. When I saw it, I prostrated myself on the ground, and I heard him speak.</p>
<a href="#EZK.2"><h3 id="EZK.2" class="usx-c">2</h3></a>
<p id="s1-EZK.2" class="usx-s1" >Ezekiel was called to be a prophet</p>
<p id="p-EZK.2" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EZK.2.1"><sup id="EZK.2.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
He said to me, “You human, stand up while I speak to you.” <a href="#EZK.2.2"><sup id="EZK.2.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
While he spoke to me, <span id="add-EZK.2.2" class="usx-add">God’s</span> Spirit entered me and enabled me to stand up. Then I heard him speak to me.</p>
<p id="p-EZK.2.2" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EZK.2.3"><sup id="EZK.2.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
He said, “You human, I will send you to the Israeli people. They are people who have turned away from me and rebelled against me. Their ancestors rebelled against me, and they themselves are still rebelling against me. <a href="#EZK.2.4"><sup id="EZK.2.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
The people to whom I will send you are very stubborn [DOU]. But say to them, ‘This is what Yahweh the Lord says to you.’ <a href="#EZK.2.5"><sup id="EZK.2.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
And<span id="add-EZK.2.5" class="usx-add">when you tell them my messages</span>, perhaps those rebellious people will heed those messages and perhaps they will not heed them, but they will know that<span id="add-EZK.2.5" class="usx-add">you are</span> a prophet who has been among them. <a href="#EZK.2.6"><sup id="EZK.2.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
And you human, you must not be afraid of them or afraid of what they say. <span id="add-EZK.2.6" class="usx-add">Living among them will be like</span> living in the midst of briers or scorpions, but do not be afraid of them. They are rebellious people [MTY], but do not allow them to cause you to become afraid. <a href="#EZK.2.7"><sup id="EZK.2.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Tell them my message, but do not expect them to pay attention to it, because they are<span id="add-EZK.2.7" class="usx-add">very</span> rebellious. <a href="#EZK.2.8"><sup id="EZK.2.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
But human, you must pay attention to what I say. Do not be rebellious like they are. <span id="add-EZK.2.8" class="usx-add">Now</span> open your mouth and eat what I give to you.”</p>
<p id="p-EZK.2.8" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EZK.2.9"><sup id="EZK.2.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
Then, as I watched, I saw his hand that was stretched toward me. In his hand was a scroll. <a href="#EZK.2.10"><sup id="EZK.2.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
He unrolled the scroll. On both sides of it were written words that expressed sorrow and mourning and words about trouble/disaster.</p>
<a href="#EZK.3"><h3 id="EZK.3" class="usx-c">3</h3></a>
<p id="p-EZK.3" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EZK.3.1"><sup id="EZK.3.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
He said to me, “You human, eat this scroll that is in front of you. Then go and speak to the Israeli people [MTY].” <a href="#EZK.3.2"><sup id="EZK.3.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
So I opened my mouth, and he gave me the scroll to eat it.</p>
<p id="p-EZK.3.2" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EZK.3.3"><sup id="EZK.3.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
Then he said to me, “You human, eat the scroll that I have given to you. Fill your stomach with it.” So I ate it, and in my mouth it tasted as sweet as honey.</p>
<p id="p-EZK.3.3" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#EZK.3.4"><sup id="EZK.3.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
Then he said to me, “You human, go to the Israeli people [MTY] and tell them my message. <a href="#EZK.3.5"><sup id="EZK.3.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
The people to whom I am sending you are not people whose language is very difficult<span id="add-EZK.3.5" class="usx-add">to learn</span>, a language which you do not understand. I am sending you to your Israeli people [MTY]. <a href="#EZK.3.6"><sup id="EZK.3.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
I am sending you to people whose language you understand very well.

But I will enable you [SYN] to be as stubborn and tough as they are. <a href="#EZK.3.9"><sup id="EZK.3.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
I will cause you to be as firm/unbreakable as [SIM] the hardest stone, like flint. So, <span id="add-EZK.3.9" class="usx-add">even though</span> they are very rebellious people, do not be afraid of them; do not allow them to cause you to be afraid.”</p>

    <a href="#EZK.3.10"><sup id="EZK.3.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
He also said to me, “You human, listen very carefully to what I say, and keep thinking about it [IDM]. <a href="#EZK.3.11"><sup id="EZK.3.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
Go to your fellow Israelis who are<span id="add-EZK.3.11" class="usx-add">here after being</span> ◄exiled/forced to leave their country►, and speak to them.

    <a href="#EZK.3.12"><sup id="EZK.3.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
Then<span id="add-EZK.3.12" class="usx-add">in the vision</span> the Spirit<span id="add-EZK.3.12" class="usx-add">of God</span> lifted me up, and I heard behind me<span id="add-EZK.3.12" class="usx-add">someone speaking very loudly</span>, like a loud rumbling sound. <span id="add-EZK.3.12" class="usx-add">I heard someone say,</span> “Praise our glorious Yahweh in the place where he lives<span id="add-EZK.3.12" class="usx-add">in heaven</span>!” <a href="#EZK.3.13"><sup id="EZK.3.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
<span id="add-EZK.3.13" class="usx-add">I heard</span> the sound of the wings of the four living creatures brushing against each other, and<span id="add-EZK.3.13" class="usx-add">I also heard</span> the sound of the wheels that were beside them.

The Spirit took me away. Within me I was very bitter and angry [DOU], but I felt Yahweh holding me very powerfully. <a href="#EZK.3.15"><sup id="EZK.3.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
I came to the exiles who lived at Tel Abib<span id="add-EZK.3.15" class="usx-add">town</span> near the Kebar River/Canal<span id="add-EZK.3.15" class="usx-add">south of Babylon</span>. Then, where they were living, I sat for seven days. I was shocked<span id="add-EZK.3.15" class="usx-add">about everything that I had seen</span>.</p>
<p id="s1-EZK.3.15" class="usx-s1" >The warning to the Israeli people</p>

    <a href="#EZK.3.16"><sup id="EZK.3.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
After those seven days had ended, Yahweh gave me this message: <a href="#EZK.3.17"><sup id="EZK.3.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
“You human, I am appointing you<span id="add-EZK.3.17" class="usx-add">to be like</span> a watchman [MET] for the Israeli people [MTY]. <span id="add-EZK.3.17" class="usx-add">So</span> listen to these messages that I will give you, and tell them those messages to warn them. <a href="#EZK.3.18"><sup id="EZK.3.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>

But if you warn the wicked people and they do not turn from all their wicked behavior [DOU], they will die because of their sins, but you will have saved yourself<span id="add-EZK.3.19" class="usx-add">from my punishing you</span>.</p>

On the fifth day of the sixth month <span id="add-EZK.8.1" class="usx-add">of that year</span>, almost six years after we Israeli people had been ◄exiled/forced to go to Babylon►, I was sitting in my house.

He reached out what seemed to be a hand and grabbed me by the hair of my head.

He took me <span id="add-EZK.8.3" class="usx-add">to the temple</span>, to the north gate, to the place where there was an idol that caused Yahweh to be very disgusted and furious. <a href="#EZK.8.4"><sup id="EZK.8.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
And there in front of me was the brilliant light that indicated the presence of the God whom the Israeli <span id="add-EZK.8.4" class="usx-add">people previously worshiped. It was</span> like the vision that I had seen alongside the Kebar River/Canal.</p>
