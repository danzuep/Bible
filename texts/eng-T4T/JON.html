    <span id="add-JON.1.1" class="usx-add">One day</span> Yahweh said to <span id="add-JON.1.1" class="usx-add">the prophet</span> Jonah, the son of Amittai, <a href="#JON.1.2"><sup id="JON.1.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
“I have <span id="add-JON.1.2" class="usx-add">seen</span> how wicked <span id="add-JON.1.2" class="usx-add">the people of</span> [MTY] the great city of Nineveh are. Therefore go there and warn the people that <span id="add-JON.1.2" class="usx-add">I am planning to</span> destroy their city <span id="add-JON.1.2" class="usx-add">because of their sins</span>.” <a href="#JON.1.3"><sup id="JON.1.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
But <span id="add-JON.1.3" class="usx-add">instead of going to Nineveh</span>, Jonah <span id="add-JON.1.3" class="usx-add">went in the direction</span> opposite to where Yahweh <span id="add-JON.1.3" class="usx-add">told him to go</span>. He went down to Joppa <span id="add-JON.1.3" class="usx-add">city</span>. There he bought a ticket to travel on a ship that was going to Tarshish <span id="add-JON.1.3" class="usx-add">city</span>, in order to avoid <span id="add-JON.1.3" class="usx-add">doing what</span> Yahweh <span id="add-JON.1.3" class="usx-add">told him to do</span>. <span id="add-JON.1.3" class="usx-add">He got on the ship,</span> and <span id="add-JON.1.3" class="usx-add">then went down</span> to a lower deck, <span id="add-JON.1.3" class="usx-add">lay down, and went to sleep</span>.</p>
<p id="p-JON.1.3" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JON.1.4"><sup id="JON.1.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
Then Yahweh caused a very strong wind to blow, and there was such a violent storm that <span id="add-JON.1.4" class="usx-add">the sailors thought</span> the ship would break apart. <a href="#JON.1.5"><sup id="JON.1.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
The sailors were very frightened. Because of that, they each <span id="add-JON.1.5" class="usx-add">started to</span> pray to their own gods <span id="add-JON.1.5" class="usx-add">to save them</span>. Then they threw the cargo into the sea to make the ship lighter <span id="add-JON.1.5" class="usx-add">in order that it would not sink easily</span>.</p>
<p id="p-JON.1.5" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JON.1.6"><sup id="JON.1.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
Then the captain went <span id="add-JON.1.6" class="usx-add">down</span> to where Jonah was sleeping soundly. <span id="add-JON.1.6" class="usx-add">He awoke him</span> and said <span id="add-JON.1.6" class="usx-add">to him</span>, “◄How can you sleep <span id="add-JON.1.6" class="usx-add">during a storm like this</span>?/You should not be sleeping <span id="add-JON.1.6" class="usx-add">during a storm like this</span>► [RHQ]! Get up and pray to your god! Perhaps he will pity us and save us, in order that we will not drown!” <span id="add-JON.1.6" class="usx-add">But Jonah refused to do that</span>.</p>
<p id="p-JON.1.6" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JON.1.7"><sup id="JON.1.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Then the sailors said to each other, “We need to ◄cast lots/shake from a container small objects that we have all marked►, to determine who has caused <span id="add-JON.1.7" class="usx-add">all </span> this trouble!” So they did that, and <span id="add-JON.1.7" class="usx-add">the object with</span> Jonah’s mark fell out <span id="add-JON.1.7" class="usx-add">of the container</span>. <a href="#JON.1.8"><sup id="JON.1.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
So <span id="add-JON.1.8" class="usx-add">various ones of</span> them asked him, “Are you the one who has caused us all this trouble?” “What work do you do?” “Where are you <span id="add-JON.1.8" class="usx-add">coming</span> from?” “What country and what people-group do you belong to?”</p>
<p id="p-JON.1.8" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JON.1.9"><sup id="JON.1.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
Jonah replied, “I am a Hebrew. I worship Yahweh God, who <span id="add-JON.1.9" class="usx-add">lives in</span> heaven. He is the one who made the sea and the land. I am trying to escape from <span id="add-JON.1.9" class="usx-add">doing what</span> Yahweh <span id="add-JON.1.9" class="usx-add">told me to do</span>.”</p>
<p id="p-JON.1.9" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JON.1.10"><sup id="JON.1.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
After the sailors heard that, they were terrified. So they asked him, “Do you realize what <span id="add-JON.1.10" class="usx-add">trouble</span> you have caused?”</p>
<p id="p-JON.1.10" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JON.1.11"><sup id="JON.1.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
The <span id="add-JON.1.11" class="usx-add">storm kept getting worse and</span> the waves kept getting bigger. So <span id="add-JON.1.11" class="usx-add">one of</span> the sailors asked Jonah, “What should we do in order to make the sea become calm?” <a href="#JON.1.12"><sup id="JON.1.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
He replied, “Pick me up and throw me into the sea. <span id="add-JON.1.12" class="usx-add">If you do that</span>, it will become calm. I know that this terrible storm is the result of my <span id="add-JON.1.12" class="usx-add">not doing what Yahweh told me to do</span>.”</p>
<p id="p-JON.1.12" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JON.1.13"><sup id="JON.1.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
But the sailors did <span id="add-JON.1.13" class="usx-add">not want to do that</span>. <span id="add-JON.1.13" class="usx-add">Instead</span>, they tried hard to row the ship back to the land. But they could not <span id="add-JON.1.13" class="usx-add">do that</span>, because the storm continued to get worse. <a href="#JON.1.14"><sup id="JON.1.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
Therefore they prayed to Yahweh, and <span id="add-JON.1.14" class="usx-add">one of them</span> prayed, “O Yahweh, please do not let us drown because of our causing this man to die. O Yahweh, you have done what you wanted to do. <span id="add-JON.1.14" class="usx-add">We do not know if this man has sinned. If</span> he has not sinned, do not consider that we are guilty of sinning when we cause him to die!” <a href="#JON.1.15"><sup id="JON.1.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
Then they picked Jonah up and threw him into the sea. Then the sea became calm. <a href="#JON.1.16"><sup id="JON.1.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
<span id="add-JON.1.16" class="usx-add">When that happened</span>, the sailors became greatly awed at Yahweh’s <span id="add-JON.1.16" class="usx-add">power</span>. So they offered a sacrifice to Yahweh, and they strongly promised <span id="add-JON.1.16" class="usx-add">him that they would do things that would please him</span>.</p>
<p id="p-JON.1.16" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JON.1.17"><sup id="JON.1.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>

    <span id="add-JON.1.17" class="usx-add">While they were doing that,</span> Yahweh sent a huge fish that swallowed Jonah. Then Jonah was inside the fish for three days and three nights.</p>

    <span id="add-JON.2.1" class="usx-add">While he was</span> inside the huge fish, Jonah prayed to Yahweh God, <span id="add-JON.2.1" class="usx-add">whom</span> he <span id="add-JON.2.1" class="usx-add">worshiped. After Yahweh told him that he would answer his prayer,</span> <a href="#JON.2.2"><sup id="JON.2.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
Jonah said,</p>
<p id="pi1-JON.2.2" class="usx-pi1" >“Yahweh, when I was greatly distressed <span id="add-JON.2.2" class="usx-add">here</span>, I prayed to you, and you heard what I <span id="add-JON.2.2" class="usx-add">prayed</span>. When I was <span id="add-JON.2.2" class="usx-add">about to descend way down into</span> the place where dead people go, you heard me when I called out <span id="add-JON.2.2" class="usx-add">for you to help/save me</span>.</p>

You threw me <span id="add-JON.2.3" class="usx-add">down</span> into the deep <span id="add-JON.2.3" class="usx-add">water</span>, into the bottom [DOU] of the sea. The currents of the sea swirled around me, and the huge waves crashed above me.</p>
<p id="pi1-JON.2.3" class="usx-pi1" >
    <a href="#JON.2.4"><sup id="JON.2.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
Then I thought, ‘You have banished me, and I will never be able to enter your presence again. I will never see your holy temple <span id="add-JON.2.4" class="usx-add">in Jerusalem</span> again!’</p>

I sank down to where the mountains start rising [MET] <span id="add-JON.2.6" class="usx-add">from the bottom of the sea</span>.

When I was almost dead [EUP], Yahweh, I ◄thought about/prayed to► you. You <span id="add-JON.2.7" class="usx-add">heard</span> my prayer, up <span id="add-JON.2.7" class="usx-add">there where</span> you <span id="add-JON.2.7" class="usx-add">are, in</span> your holy temple.</p>

Then Yahweh commanded the huge fish to vomit out Jonah, <span id="add-JON.2.10" class="usx-add">and the fish did that</span>, and <span id="add-JON.2.10" class="usx-add">Jonah was able to get</span> to the land.</p>

Jonah was very happy about <span id="add-JON.4.6" class="usx-add">having</span> the vine <span id="add-JON.4.6" class="usx-add">over his head</span>. <a href="#JON.4.7"><sup id="JON.4.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
But before dawn the next day, God sent a worm that chewed the vine, with the result that the vine withered. <a href="#JON.4.8"><sup id="JON.4.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
Then, when the sun rose <span id="add-JON.4.8" class="usx-add">high in the sky</span>, God sent a very hot wind from the east, and the sun shone very strongly on Jonah’s head, with the result that he felt faint. He wanted to die, and he said, “It would be better for me to die than to <span id="add-JON.4.8" class="usx-add">continue to</span> live!”</p>
<p id="p-JON.4.8" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JON.4.9"><sup id="JON.4.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
But God asked Jonah, “Is it right for you to be angry about <span id="add-JON.4.9" class="usx-add">what happened to</span> the vine?” Jonah replied, “<span id="add-JON.4.9" class="usx-add">Yes</span>, it is right! <span id="add-JON.4.9" class="usx-add">Now</span> I am very angry and I want to die!”</p>

    <a href="#JON.4.10"><sup id="JON.4.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
But Yahweh said <span id="add-JON.4.10" class="usx-add">to him</span>, “You have been concerned about my <span id="add-JON.4.10" class="usx-add">causing</span> that vine <span id="add-JON.4.10" class="usx-add">to wither</span>, even though you did not take care of it, and you did not make it grow. It just grew up during one night, and it completely withered <span id="add-JON.4.10" class="usx-add">at the end of</span> the next night. <a href="#JON.4.11"><sup id="JON.4.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
But there are more than 120,000 people in Nineveh who <span id="add-JON.4.11" class="usx-add">are very young, and because of that</span>, they cannot tell which is their right hand and which is their left hand, and there are also many cattle, <span id="add-JON.4.11" class="usx-add">and none of these have done anything to displease me</span>. So ◄is it not right for me to be concerned about the people of that huge city, <span id="add-JON.4.11" class="usx-add">and not want to destroy them</span>?/it is certainly right for me to be concerned about the people of that huge city <span id="add-JON.4.11" class="usx-add">and not want to destroy them</span>!► [RHQ]”</p>
