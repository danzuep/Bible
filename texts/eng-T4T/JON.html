“I have <span id="add-JON.1.2" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">seen</span> how wicked <span id="add-JON.1.2" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the people of</span> [MTY] the great city of Nineveh are.

But <span id="add-JON.1.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">instead of going to Nineveh</span>, Jonah <span id="add-JON.1.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">went in the direction</span> opposite to where Yahweh <span id="add-JON.1.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">told him to go</span>. He went down to Joppa <span id="add-JON.1.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">city</span>. There he bought a ticket to travel on a ship that was going to Tarshish <span id="add-JON.1.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">city</span>, in order to avoid <span id="add-JON.1.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">doing what</span> Yahweh <span id="add-JON.1.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">told him to do</span>. <span id="add-JON.1.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">He got on the ship,</span> and <span id="add-JON.1.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">then went down</span> to a lower deck, <span id="add-JON.1.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">lay down, and went to sleep</span>.</p>
<p id="p-JON.1.3" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JON.1.4"><sup id="JON.1.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
Then Yahweh caused a very strong wind to blow, and there was such a violent storm that <span id="add-JON.1.4" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the sailors thought</span> the ship would break apart. <a href="#JON.1.5"><sup id="JON.1.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
The sailors were very frightened. Because of that, they each <span id="add-JON.1.5" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">started to</span> pray to their own gods <span id="add-JON.1.5" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to save them</span>. Then they threw the cargo into the sea to make the ship lighter <span id="add-JON.1.5" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in order that it would not sink easily</span>.</p>
<p id="p-JON.1.5" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JON.1.6"><sup id="JON.1.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
Then the captain went <span id="add-JON.1.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">down</span> to where Jonah was sleeping soundly. <span id="add-JON.1.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">He awoke him</span> and said <span id="add-JON.1.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to him</span>, “◄How can you sleep <span id="add-JON.1.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">during a storm like this</span>?/You should not be sleeping <span id="add-JON.1.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">during a storm like this</span>► [RHQ]! Get up and pray to your god! Perhaps he will pity us and save us, in order that we will not drown!” <span id="add-JON.1.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">But Jonah refused to do that</span>.</p>
<p id="p-JON.1.6" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JON.1.7"><sup id="JON.1.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Then the sailors said to each other, “We need to ◄cast lots/shake from a container small objects that we have all marked►, to determine who has caused <span id="add-JON.1.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">all </span> this trouble!” So they did that, and <span id="add-JON.1.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the object with</span> Jonah’s mark fell out <span id="add-JON.1.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">of the container</span>. <a href="#JON.1.8"><sup id="JON.1.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
So <span id="add-JON.1.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">various ones of</span> them asked him, “Are you the one who has caused us all this trouble?” “What work do you do?” “Where are you <span id="add-JON.1.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">coming</span> from?” “What country and what people-group do you belong to?”</p>
<p id="p-JON.1.8" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JON.1.9"><sup id="JON.1.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
Jonah replied, “I am a Hebrew. I worship Yahweh God, who <span id="add-JON.1.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">lives in</span> heaven. He is the one who made the sea and the land. I am trying to escape from <span id="add-JON.1.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">doing what</span> Yahweh <span id="add-JON.1.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">told me to do</span>.”</p>
<p id="p-JON.1.9" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JON.1.10"><sup id="JON.1.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
After the sailors heard that, they were terrified. So they asked him, “Do you realize what <span id="add-JON.1.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">trouble</span> you have caused?”</p>
<p id="p-JON.1.10" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JON.1.11"><sup id="JON.1.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
The <span id="add-JON.1.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">storm kept getting worse and</span> the waves kept getting bigger. So <span id="add-JON.1.11" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">one of</span> the sailors asked Jonah, “What should we do in order to make the sea become calm?” <a href="#JON.1.12"><sup id="JON.1.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
He replied, “Pick me up and throw me into the sea. <span id="add-JON.1.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">If you do that</span>, it will become calm. I know that this terrible storm is the result of my <span id="add-JON.1.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">not doing what Yahweh told me to do</span>.”</p>
<p id="p-JON.1.12" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JON.1.13"><sup id="JON.1.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
But the sailors did <span id="add-JON.1.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">not want to do that</span>. <span id="add-JON.1.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Instead</span>, they tried hard to row the ship back to the land. But they could not <span id="add-JON.1.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">do that</span>, because the storm continued to get worse. <a href="#JON.1.14"><sup id="JON.1.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
Therefore they prayed to Yahweh, and <span id="add-JON.1.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">one of them</span> prayed, “O Yahweh, please do not let us drown because of our causing this man to die.

If</span> he has not sinned, do not consider that we are guilty of sinning when we cause him to die!” <a href="#JON.1.15"><sup id="JON.1.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
Then they picked Jonah up and threw him into the sea. Then the sea became calm. <a href="#JON.1.16"><sup id="JON.1.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
<span id="add-JON.1.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">When that happened</span>, the sailors became greatly awed at Yahweh’s <span id="add-JON.1.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">power</span>. So they offered a sacrifice to Yahweh, and they strongly promised <span id="add-JON.1.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">him that they would do things that would please him</span>.</p>

Jonah said,</p>

Then he sent messengers to proclaim to <span id="add-JON.3.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the people in</span> Nineveh: “My advisors and I have decreed that no one may eat or drink anything. Do not even allow your animals to eat or drink. <a href="#JON.3.8"><sup id="JON.3.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
Instead, every person must put on coarse cloth. <span id="add-JON.3.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Put coarse cloth on</span> your animals, <span id="add-JON.3.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">too</span>. Then everyone must pray fervently to God.

Perhaps, <span id="add-JON.3.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">if everyone does that</span>, God may change his mind and be merciful <span id="add-JON.3.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to us</span>, and stop being very angry with us, with the result that we will not die.”</p>

When they <span id="add-JON.3.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">all did that</span>, God saw what they were doing, and he saw that they had stopped doing evil things. So <span id="add-JON.3.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">he pitied them, and</span> he did not get rid of them as he had threatened to do.</p>

<p id="s1-JON.4" class="usx-s1" >God said it was more right for him to spare the Ninevites than to spare the vine he sent to spare Jonah</p>

But Jonah was very distressed <span id="add-JON.4.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that God had not destroyed Nineveh</span>. He became very angry. <span id="add-JON.4.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">The people of Nineveh were non-Jews, and Jonah did not think that God should act mercifully toward anyone who was not a Jew</span>. <a href="#JON.4.2"><sup id="JON.4.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
He prayed to Yahweh, “O Yahweh, what you have done is what I thought that you would do, before I left home [RHQ]. That is why I <span id="add-JON.4.2" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">decided</span> immediately to run away, and go to Tarshish <span id="add-JON.4.2" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">city</span>, because I knew that you, O God, act very kindly and compassionately <span id="add-JON.4.2" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">toward all people</span>. You do not quickly become angry with people who do evil things.

Jonah <span id="add-JON.4.5" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">did not reply</span>. He went out of the city to the east <span id="add-JON.4.5" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">side of it</span>. He made a small shelter in order that he could sit under it and be protected from the sun. He sat under the shelter and waited to see what would happen to the city. <a href="#JON.4.6"><sup id="JON.4.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
Then Yahweh God caused a vine to grow up <span id="add-JON.4.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">immediately</span> to shade Jonah’s head from the sun and make him <span id="add-JON.4.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">feel</span> more comfortable. Jonah was very happy about <span id="add-JON.4.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">having</span> the vine <span id="add-JON.4.6" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">over his head</span>. <a href="#JON.4.7"><sup id="JON.4.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
But before dawn the next day, God sent a worm that chewed the vine, with the result that the vine withered. <a href="#JON.4.8"><sup id="JON.4.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
Then, when the sun rose <span id="add-JON.4.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">high in the sky</span>, God sent a very hot wind from the east, and the sun shone very strongly on Jonah’s head, with the result that he felt faint. He wanted to die, and he said, “It would be better for me to die than to <span id="add-JON.4.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">continue to</span> live!”</p>

But God asked Jonah, “Is it right for you to be angry about <span id="add-JON.4.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">what happened to</span> the vine?” Jonah replied, “<span id="add-JON.4.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Yes</span>, it is right! <span id="add-JON.4.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Now</span> I am very angry and I want to die!”</p>

    <a href="#JON.4.10"><sup id="JON.4.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
