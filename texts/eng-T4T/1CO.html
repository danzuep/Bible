My fellow believers, this is what I mean: There is not much time left <span id="add-1CO.7.29" class="usx-add">before Christ returns</span>. So, from now on those men who are married should <span id="add-1CO.7.29" class="usx-add">devote themselves to serving the Lord as much</span> as they would if they were not married. <a href="#1CO.7.30"><sup id="1CO.7.30" class="usx-v">30</sup></a>

Those who are buying things should <span id="add-1CO.7.31" class="usx-add">devote themselves to serving the Lord as much</span> as they would if they did not possess those things.

So, my fellow believers whom I love, continue to hold strongly to <span id="add-1CO.15.58" class="usx-add">the things that you believe</span>. Do not let anything cause you to doubt them. Always be doing enthusiastically the work that the Lord <span id="add-1CO.15.58" class="usx-add">gives you</span>. And remember that the work that you do for the Lord is never ◄in vain/useless►, <span id="add-1CO.15.58" class="usx-add">as it would be if God will not cause us to live again after we die</span>.</p>

Now <span id="add-1CO.16.1" class="usx-add">I will reply to another question that you asked.

Every Sunday each of you should set aside <span id="add-1CO.16.2" class="usx-add">at home</span> some funds [EUP] <span id="add-1CO.16.2" class="usx-add">for this purpose</span>, in proportion to how much <span id="add-1CO.16.2" class="usx-add">God</span> has prospered you. Then you should save it up, so that when I arrive there, you will not need to collect <span id="add-1CO.16.2" class="usx-add">any more money. Choose some men whom you approve of, to take</span> this money to Jerusalem. <a href="#1CO.16.3"><sup id="1CO.16.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
Then, when I arrive, I will write letters stating that you have authorized these men to take the funds there. <a href="#1CO.16.4"><sup id="1CO.16.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
And if <span id="add-1CO.16.4" class="usx-add">you</span> (OR, <span id="add-1CO.16.4" class="usx-add">I</span>) think that it is appropriate, I will go with them.</p>

I do not want to see you just for a short time and then continue my trip. I am hoping to stay with you for a while, if the Lord <span id="add-1CO.16.7" class="usx-add">Jesus</span> allows me to do that. <a href="#1CO.16.8"><sup id="1CO.16.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
