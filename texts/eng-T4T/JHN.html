That is the reason that they said, “He is old enough <span id="add-JHN.9.23" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to answer questions</span>, so ask him!”</p>

    <a href="#JHN.9.24"><sup id="JHN.9.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
So they sent someone to bring back to them the man who had been blind. <span id="add-JHN.9.24" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">When he got there</span>, the <span id="add-JHN.9.24" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Jewish leaders</span> said to him, “Knowing that God <span id="add-JHN.9.24" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">is listening</span> [IDM], tell the truth!

So they said to him, “What did he do to you? How did he enable you to see?” <a href="#JHN.9.27"><sup id="JHN.9.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
He replied, “I told you that already, but you did not [RHQ] pay attention! Why do you want to hear me tell you again? ◄Do you also want to become his disciples?/You talk as though [IRO] you also want to become his disciples [RHQ]►.” <a href="#JHN.9.28"><sup id="JHN.9.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
Then they insulted him angrily. They said, “You are that man’s disciple, but we are Moses’ disciples! <a href="#JHN.9.29"><sup id="JHN.9.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>
We know that God spoke to Moses; but this man, we do not know where he is from or where he <span id="add-JHN.9.29" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">gets any authority</span> from!” <a href="#JHN.9.30"><sup id="JHN.9.30" class="usx-v">30</sup></a>
The man replied, “That is very surprising!

We know that God does not help sinners <span id="add-JHN.9.31" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">who ask God to help them</span>.

No one has ever enabled a man to see who was blind when he was born <span id="add-JHN.9.32" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">like I was</span>. That has never happened since the world began! <a href="#JHN.9.33"><sup id="JHN.9.33" class="usx-v">33</sup></a>

So they followed her, thinking that she was going to the tomb <span id="add-JHN.11.31" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">where they had buried Lazarus</span>, in order to cry there.</p>
<p id="p-JHN.11.31" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JHN.11.32"><sup id="JHN.11.32" class="usx-v">32</sup></a>
When Mary got to where Jesus was and saw him, she prostrated herself at his feet and said, “Lord, if you had been here, my <span id="add-JHN.11.32" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">younger</span> brother would not have died!” <a href="#JHN.11.33"><sup id="JHN.11.33" class="usx-v">33</sup></a>
When Jesus saw her crying, and saw that the Jews who had come with her were also crying, he was very angry <span id="add-JHN.11.33" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that Satan had caused Lazarus to die</span> (OR, very troubled) and disturbed in his spirit. <a href="#JHN.11.34"><sup id="JHN.11.34" class="usx-v">34</sup></a>

But some others said, “He enabled a blind man to see.

    <a href="#JHN.11.38"><sup id="JHN.11.38" class="usx-v">38</sup></a>
Within himself Jesus was again very angry <span id="add-JHN.11.38" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">about Lazarus dying</span> (OR, very troubled). He came to the tomb. It was a cave. The entrance had been covered with a large stone. <a href="#JHN.11.39"><sup id="JHN.11.39" class="usx-v">39</sup></a>
Jesus said, “Take away the stone!” Martha, <span id="add-JHN.11.39" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">who, as I mentioned before, was an older</span> sister of the man who had died, said, “Lord, his <span id="add-JHN.11.39" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">body</span> has been <span id="add-JHN.11.39" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in the tomb</span> for four days, so now there will be a bad smell!” <a href="#JHN.11.40"><sup id="JHN.11.40" class="usx-v">40</sup></a>
Jesus said to her, “I told [RHQ] you that if you believed <span id="add-JHN.11.40" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in</span> ◄<span id="add-JHN.11.40" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">me/what I can do</span>►, you would see how great God is!

So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up <span id="add-JHN.11.41" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">toward heaven</span> and said, “My Father, I thank you that you heard me <span id="add-JHN.11.41" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">when I prayed about this earlier</span>. <a href="#JHN.11.42"><sup id="JHN.11.42" class="usx-v">42</sup></a>

After he said that, he shouted, “Lazarus, come out!” <a href="#JHN.11.44"><sup id="JHN.11.44" class="usx-v">44</sup></a>
The man who <span id="add-JHN.11.44" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">had been</span> dead came out! The strips of cloth were still wrapped around his <span id="add-JHN.11.44" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">hands and feet</span>, and a cloth was still around his face, <span id="add-JHN.11.44" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">but he came out</span>! Jesus said to them, “Take off the cloths so that he can walk easily!” <span id="add-JHN.11.44" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">So they did that</span>.</p>

    <a href="#JHN.11.45"><sup id="JHN.11.45" class="usx-v">45</sup></a>
As a result, many of the Jews who had come to <span id="add-JHN.11.45" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">see</span> Mary and who had seen what Jesus did, believed that he ◄<span id="add-JHN.11.45" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">was the Messiah/had come from God</span>►. <a href="#JHN.11.46"><sup id="JHN.11.46" class="usx-v">46</sup></a>

So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered all the members of the <span id="add-JHN.11.47" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Jewish</span> Council together.

One of the <span id="add-JHN.11.49" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Jewish Council</span> members was Caiaphas. He was the Jewish high priest that year. <span id="add-JHN.11.49" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Hinting that they should get rid of Jesus</span>, he said to them, “You <span id="add-JHN.11.49" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">talk as though you</span> do not know anything [HYP]! <a href="#JHN.11.50"><sup id="JHN.11.50" class="usx-v">50</sup></a>
You do not realize that it would be much better for us if one man died for the sake of the people rather than that <span id="add-JHN.11.50" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the Romans kill</span> all the <span id="add-JHN.11.50" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">people of our Jewish</span> nation.” <a href="#JHN.11.51"><sup id="JHN.11.51" class="usx-v">51</sup></a>
He said that, not because he thought of it himself. Instead, since he was the high priest that year, he was prophesying that Jesus would die for the whole <span id="add-JHN.11.51" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Jewish</span> nation. <a href="#JHN.11.52"><sup id="JHN.11.52" class="usx-v">52</sup></a>
But he was also prophesying that Jesus would die, not just for the Jews, but for all the people living in other lands who <span id="add-JHN.11.52" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">would belong</span> to God, in order that he would unite <span id="add-JHN.11.52" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">all of them into</span> one <span id="add-JHN.11.52" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">group</span>. <a href="#JHN.11.53"><sup id="JHN.11.53" class="usx-v">53</sup></a>

    <a href="#JHN.11.54"><sup id="JHN.11.54" class="usx-v">54</sup></a>
Because of that, Jesus no longer traveled around publicly among the Jewish people.

But they kept looking for him, and as they were standing in the Temple <span id="add-JHN.11.56-57" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">courtyard</span> they were saying to each other, “What do you think?

He knew <span id="add-JHN.13.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">we would continue to live here</span> in this world, so now he <span id="add-JHN.13.1" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">showed us</span> how completely he loved us. <a href="#JHN.13.2"><sup id="JHN.13.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
We were eating <span id="add-JHN.13.2" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the Passover meal</span>. ◄The devil/Satan► had already suggested to Judas Iscariot (OR, Judas, the man from Kerioth <span id="add-JHN.13.2" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Town</span>), the son of Simon, that he should ◄betray Jesus/enable Jesus’ enemies to seize him►. <a href="#JHN.13.3"><sup id="JHN.13.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
But Jesus knew that his Father had given to him complete authority <span id="add-JHN.13.3" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to control the situation</span>.

<span id="add-JHN.13.4" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">But before he left us, he wanted to show us how we should love each other</span>. <span id="add-JHN.13.4" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">So</span> he got up from where he was eating.

Jesus replied to him, “Now you do not understand <span id="add-JHN.13.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the meaning of</span> what I am doing, but you will understand later.” <a href="#JHN.13.8"><sup id="JHN.13.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
Peter said, “I will never, ever, <span id="add-JHN.13.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">allow you to</span> wash my feet!” Jesus replied to him, “If I do not wash you, you cannot continue ◄to be my <span id="add-JHN.13.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">disciple/to belong to</span> me►.” <a href="#JHN.13.9"><sup id="JHN.13.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
So Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, <span id="add-JHN.13.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in that case</span>, do not wash only my feet.

The <span id="add-JHN.13.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">rest of their bodies are</span> clean.

    <a href="#JHN.13.12"><sup id="JHN.13.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
After he finished washing our feet, he put his cloak back on. Then he sat down and said to us, “Do you understand what I have done for you? <a href="#JHN.13.13"><sup id="JHN.13.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
You <span id="add-JHN.13.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">show that you respect me by</span> calling me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord’.

But if I, who am your teacher and your Lord, have washed your feet, you ought to <span id="add-JHN.13.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">serve each other by doing things like</span> washing each other’s feet. <a href="#JHN.13.15"><sup id="JHN.13.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>

After Jesus said this, he was very troubled.

Simon Peter and <span id="add-JHN.18.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">I</span> were following Jesus.

But Peter <span id="add-JHN.18.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">had to</span> wait outside near the doorway. However, since I knew the high priest, I went back to the doorway and spoke to the girl who was guarding the entrance.

The servant girl who was guarding the doorway said to Peter, “Surely you are not another disciple of that man <span id="add-JHN.18.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">they have arrested</span>, are you?” He said, “I am not.” <a href="#JHN.18.18"><sup id="JHN.18.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
It was cold, so the high priest’s slaves and Temple guards made a charcoal fire and were standing around it to keep warm. Peter was also standing near it, warming himself.</p>

Jesus replied, “I have always spoken where many people [MTY, HYP] could hear me.

Many Jews were <span id="add-JHN.19.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">able to</span> read this sign, because the place where Jesus was nailed {where they nailed Jesus} to the cross was very close to <span id="add-JHN.19.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Jerusalem, where many people had come for the celebration</span>, and because it was written {they wrote it} in three languages: Hebrew, Latin, and Greek. <a href="#JHN.19.21"><sup id="JHN.19.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>

After the soldiers nailed Jesus to the cross, they took his clothes and divided them into four parts, one part for each soldier.

So they said to each other, “Let’s not tear it.

So Mary ran to where Simon Peter and I <span id="add-JHN.20.2" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">were staying in Jerusalem</span>. She said to us, “They have taken the Lord’s <span id="add-JHN.20.2" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">body</span> out of the burial cave, and we do not know where they have put it!” <a href="#JHN.20.3"><sup id="JHN.20.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
So Peter and I started going to the cave. <a href="#JHN.20.4"><sup id="JHN.20.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
We were both running, but I ran faster than Peter and got there first. <a href="#JHN.20.5"><sup id="JHN.20.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
I stooped down <span id="add-JHN.20.5" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">at the entrance</span> and looked inside.

Then Simon Peter, who was running behind me, arrived. He went inside the cave. He, too, saw the strips of linen cloth lying there. <a href="#JHN.20.7"><sup id="JHN.20.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
He also <span id="add-JHN.20.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">saw the</span> cloth that they had <span id="add-JHN.20.7" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">wrapped</span> around Jesus’ head.

Then I also went inside.

As she stood outside the cave crying, she stooped down to look inside the cave. <a href="#JHN.20.12"><sup id="JHN.20.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
She saw two angels in very white <span id="add-JHN.20.12" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">clothing</span>, sitting at the place where Jesus’ body had been laid. One was where his head had been, and the other was where his feet had been. <a href="#JHN.20.13"><sup id="JHN.20.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
They said to her, “Woman, why are you crying?” She said to them, “They have taken away <span id="add-JHN.20.13" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the body of</span> my Lord, and I do not know where they have put it!” <a href="#JHN.20.14"><sup id="JHN.20.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>

He said to her, “Woman, why are you crying? Who are you looking for?” Thinking that he was the gardener, she said to him, “Sir, if you have taken his <span id="add-JHN.20.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">body</span> away, tell me where you have put it.

Jesus said to her, “Mary!” She turned toward him <span id="add-JHN.20.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">again and recognized him</span>. Then she exclaimed in Aramaic, “Rabboni!” which means ‘Teacher’. <a href="#JHN.20.17"><sup id="JHN.20.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
Jesus said to her, “Stop clinging to me, because I have not yet returned to my Father. Go to my disciples and tell them, ‘I am about to return to my Father and your Father, to the one who is my God and your God’.” <a href="#JHN.20.18"><sup id="JHN.20.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
So Mary went to where <span id="add-JHN.20.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">we</span> disciples were and told us that she had seen the Lord <span id="add-JHN.20.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">alive again</span>.

When we had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “John’s <span id="add-JHN.21.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">son</span> Simon, do you love me more than these <span id="add-JHN.21.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">other disciples do</span>?” Peter said to him, “Yes, Lord, you know that you are dear to me (OR, that I love you).” Jesus said, “Give to <span id="add-JHN.21.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">those who belong to</span> me <span id="add-JHN.21.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">what they need spiritually, like</span> [MET] <span id="add-JHN.21.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">a shepherd provides</span> food for his lambs.” <a href="#JHN.21.16"><sup id="JHN.21.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
Jesus said to him again, “John’s <span id="add-JHN.21.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">son</span> Simon, do you love me?” He replied, “Yes, Lord, you know that you are dear to me (OR, that I love you).” Jesus said to him, “Take care of <span id="add-JHN.21.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">those who belong to</span> me, <span id="add-JHN.21.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">like</span> [MET] a <span id="add-JHN.21.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">shepherd takes care of his</span> sheep.” <a href="#JHN.21.17"><sup id="JHN.21.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
Jesus said to him a third time, “John’s son Simon, am I really dear to you (OR, do you really love me)?” Peter was grieved because Jesus asked him this three times, <span id="add-JHN.21.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and because the third time he changed the question</span>. He said, “Lord, you know everything. You know that you are dear to me (OR, that I love you).” Jesus said, “Give to <span id="add-JHN.21.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">those who belong to</span> me <span id="add-JHN.21.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">what they need spiritually, as</span> [MET] <span id="add-JHN.21.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">a shepherd provides</span> food for <span id="add-JHN.21.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">his</span> sheep. <a href="#JHN.21.18"><sup id="JHN.21.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
Now listen to this carefully: When you were young, you put your clothes on by yourself, and you went wherever you wanted to go. But when you are old, you will stretch out your arms, and someone will fasten them <span id="add-JHN.21.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">with a rope</span> and will lead you to a place where you do not want to <span id="add-JHN.21.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">go</span>.” <a href="#JHN.21.19"><sup id="JHN.21.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
Jesus said this to indicate how Peter would die ◄<span id="add-JHN.21.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">violently/on a cross</span>► in order to honor God. Then Jesus said to him, “Keep being my faithful disciple <span id="add-JHN.21.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">until you die</span>.”</p>

Peter turned around and saw that I was following them. I was the one who leaned close to Jesus during the <span id="add-JHN.21.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Passover</span> meal and said, “Lord, who is going to enable your enemies to seize you?” <a href="#JHN.21.21"><sup id="JHN.21.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
When Peter saw me, he asked, “Lord, what <span id="add-JHN.21.21" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">is going to happen</span> to him?” <a href="#JHN.21.22"><sup id="JHN.21.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
Jesus said to him, “If I want him to remain <span id="add-JHN.21.22" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">alive</span> until I return, ◄that is not your concern!/what is that to you?► [RHQ] You be my <span id="add-JHN.21.22" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">faithful</span> disciple!” <a href="#JHN.21.23"><sup id="JHN.21.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
Some of the other believers heard <span id="add-JHN.21.23" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">a report of</span> what Jesus had said about me, and <span id="add-JHN.21.23" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">they thought that Jesus meant</span> that I would not die. But Jesus did not say that I would not die. He said only, “If I want him to remain <span id="add-JHN.21.23" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">alive</span> until I return, ◄that is not your concern!/what is that to you?► [RHQ]”</p>
