<p>John 1:1-18</p><p>This book is about Jesus, who was eternally with God but also became a human being to reveal God to mankind.</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>The one who expresses [MET] ◄God’s character/what God is like► has always existed ◄from the beginning [MTY] of everything/before everything began►. He has always existed with God, and he has God’s nature. <sup>2</sup>He always existed with God before he began [MTY] to create anything. <sup>3</sup>He is the one by whom God caused everything to exist. He is the one who created absolutely everything [LIT]. <sup>4</sup>He is the one who caused everything to live. He, who caused us people to live, revealed to us the truth about God as a light [MET] reveals what is in the darkness. <sup>5</sup>People do not want him to reveal that what they do is evil [MET], just like darkness is evil. But just like darkness cannot put out light [MET], evil people have never prevented the one who was like a light from revealing God’s truth (OR, evil people have never understood the one who was like a light.)</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>A man whose name was John was sent by God {God sent a man whose name was John}. <sup>7</sup>He came to tell people about the one who was like [MET] a light. He came to show that everything that the one who was like a light [MET] said was true, in order that he could enable all people to believe in the one who was like a light. <sup>8</sup>John himself was not the one who was like a light [MET]. Instead, he came to tell others about that one who was like a light. <sup>9</sup>While John was doing that, the one who was truly like a light was about to show himself to the world. He was the one who enables all people to know about God, as a light [MET] enables people to know what is in the darkness.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Although the one who was like a light was here on the earth, and although he was the one whom God caused to create everything, most people [MTY, HYP] did not realize who he was. (OR, although he was the one whom God caused to create everything, most people did not accept him.) <sup>11</sup>Although he came to the land that belonged to him because he created it, most of his own people, the Jews, rejected him (OR, did not accept him). <sup>12</sup>But those of us who welcomed him, God authorized that we would have a relationship with him [MET] like children have a relationship with their father. We were people who believed that what he said about himself [MTY] was true. <sup>13</sup>We became like God’s children, not because our ancestors belonged to God, or because of someone’s sexual desires, nor because some man desired to have children like himself. Instead, we were caused by God {God caused us} to become like his children.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>The one who expresses [MET] ◄God’s character/what God is like► became a human being, and he lived among us for a while. As a result, we saw how wonderful he is. He came from God his father, and there was no other person as wonderful as he. He was wonderful because he always acted ◄kindly toward us/in ways we did not deserve►, and he always spoke truthfully to us about God.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    One day when John was telling people about him, he saw Jesus. Then he shouted to them, “I told you previously that someone will come later who is more important than I am, since he existed long before me. This is the man I was talking about!” <sup>16</sup>We have all benefited very much from what he has done. Again and again, he has acted in kind way toward us in ways we did not deserve. <sup>17</sup>Moses proclaimed God’s laws to our ancestors. But what Jesus Christ did for us was much better. He acted in kindness toward us in ways we did not deserve and told us the truth about God. <sup>18</sup>No one has ever seen God. But God’s only Son, Jesus, who has always had a very close relationship with God, has told us about God.</p><p>When religious authorities asked John about his identity, he said he was preparing people for the coming of the Messiah, who was much more important than himself.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>The Jewish leaders [SYN] in Jerusalem city sent some Jewish priests and ◄Levites/men who worked in the temple► to where John was, to ask him some questions. They said to him, “What do you claim about yourself?” <sup>20</sup>So John told them the truth, and he told them clearly [DOU]. He said, “I am not ◄the Messiah/God’s chosen king►!” <sup>21</sup>Then they asked him, “Then what do you say about yourself? Are you the prophet Elijah that was prophesied to return {◄someone/another prophet► prophesied would return} before the Messiah?” He replied, “No, I am not.” Then they asked him, “Are you the prophet like Moses that ◄we are waiting for/God promised to send►?” He replied, “No.” <sup>22</sup>So they asked him, “Then who do you claim to be? Tell us so that we can go back and report to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?” <sup>23</sup>John replied, “I am the one the prophet Isaiah said would proclaim this new message loudly to the people who would pass by in this desolate area: ‘Prepare yourselves to receive the Lord when he comes [MET], just like people prepare a road for an important official.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>Some of those people who were questioning John were ones who had been sent by the Pharisee religious group {whom the Pharisee religious group had sent}. <sup>25</sup>They asked John, “Since you say you are not the Messiah, nor the prophet Elijah, nor the prophet like Moses, what authority do you have? Furthermore, why are you baptizing Jews, treating them as though they were non-Jews who wanted to become Jews?” <sup>26</sup>John replied, “I am just baptizing people with water to prepare them to welcome the Messiah. But right now someone is among you whom you people do not know. <sup>27</sup>He will preach to you after I am gone. He is so important that I am not worthy to serve him as a slave [MET] by untying his sandals.”</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>Those things happened at a place called Bethany, on the east side of the Jordan River, where John was baptizing people.</p><p>John the Baptizer announced that Jesus was the one who would become a sacrifice to remove guilt for sin, and how God had confirmed that Jesus was the Son of God.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him. He said to the people, “Look! Here is the man whom God has appointed to be a sacrifice [MET], like the lambs that the people of Israel sacrificed! By sacrificing himself he will make it possible for everyone in the world to be no longer guilty for having sinned. <sup>30</sup>He is the one about whom I said before, ‘Someone will come later who is more important than I am, since he existed long before me.’ <sup>31</sup>I myself did not previously recognize that he was the Messiah. But now I know who he is, and I have baptized people with water to enable you people of Israel to recognize who he is.”</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>John spoke clearly what God had shown him about Jesus. He said, “I saw God’s Spirit as he was descending from heaven in the form of a dove. The Spirit remained on Jesus. <sup>33</sup>I myself did not know previously that he was the Messiah. However, God sent me to baptize people with water, people who said they wanted to turn from their sinful ways. While I was doing that, God told me, ‘The man on whom you will see my Spirit descend and remain is the one who will put the Holy Spirit within you (pl) to truly change your lives.’ <sup>34</sup>I saw the Spirit descend on him, and I tell you that he is ◄the Son of God/the person who is both God and man►.”</p><p>After John declared again that Jesus would be a sacrifice to remove guilt for sin, four men decided to become Jesus’ disciples.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>The next day John was at the same place again ◄with two of us/with two of his disciples►. <sup>36</sup>When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, “Look! There is the man God has appointed to be a sacrifice, like the lambs [MET] the people of Israel have sacrificed!” <sup>37</sup>◄When we/those two disciples► heard John say this, we/they went with Jesus. <sup>38</sup>Jesus turned around and saw us/them coming behind him. So he asked us/them, “What do you want?” We/They replied, “Teacher, tell us where you are staying, because we want to talk with you.” <sup>39</sup>He replied, “Come with me, and you will see where I am staying!” So we/they went with him and saw where he was staying. We/They stayed with him until about 4 o’clock (OR, from about 4 PM until the next day).</p><p>
    <sup>40</sup>◄One of us/One of the two men► who heard what John had said and who went with Jesus was Andrew, Simon Peter’s younger brother. <sup>41</sup>After Andrew left Jesus, the first thing he did was to find his own older brother Simon and say to him, “We have found the Messiah!” <sup>42</sup>Then he took Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked intently at him, and then said, “You are Simon. Your father’s name is John. You will be given {I will give you} the name Cephas.” Cephas is an Aramaic name that means ‘solid rock’. It means the same in Greek as the name Peter.</p><p>Jesus told Nathaniel that he knew about him supernaturally, but that he would do things that were more surprising than that.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>43</sup>The next day Jesus decided to leave the Jordan River valley. He went to Galilee district and (OR, on the way there he) found a man named Philip. Jesus said to him, “Come with me!” <sup>44</sup>Philip and Andrew and Peter were all from Bethsaida town. <sup>45</sup>Then Philip searched for Nathaniel and found him, and said to him, “We have met the Messiah, the one Moses wrote about! The prophets also prophesied that he would come. He is Jesus, from Nazareth town. His father’s name is Joseph.” <sup>46</sup>Nathaniel replied, “Nazareth? ◄Nothing good can come from such an unimportant place!/Can anything good come from such an unimportant place?► [RHQ]” Philip replied, “Come and see!” <sup>47</sup>When Jesus saw Nathaniel approaching, he said about Nathaniel, “Here is an example of a good Israelite! He never deceives anyone!” <sup>48</sup>Nathaniel asked him, “How do you know what I am like?” Jesus replied, “I saw you before Philip called you, when you were by yourself under the fig tree.” <sup>49</sup>Then Nathaniel declared, “Teacher, you must be ◄the Son of God/the person who is both God and man►! You are the King of Israel we have been waiting for!” <sup>50</sup>Jesus replied to him, “You [RHQ] believe those things about me because I told you I saw you when you were under the fig tree. I was able to see you supernaturally even though I was far away from you. But you will see me do things that are more surprising than that!” <sup>51</sup>Then Jesus said to him, “This is the absolute truth: Just like what your ancestor Jacob saw long ago in a vision, some day you (pl) will see heaven opened up, and you will see God’s angels ascending from me and descending on me, the one who came from heaven.”</p><a href="#JOHN-c-2"><h3 id="JOHN-c-2">2</h3></a>
<p>In Cana Jesus did his first miracle, turning water into delicious wine.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Two days later there was a wedding celebration in Cana town, in Galilee district. Jesus’ mother was there. <sup>2</sup>Jesus and we his disciples were also there, because we had been invited {someone had invited us} also. <sup>3</sup>When the guests had drunk all the wine that was there, Jesus’ mother said to him, “The wine is all gone; can you do something about that?” <sup>4</sup>Jesus said to her, “Ma’am/Woman, ◄do not tell  me what to do!/why do you tell  me what to do?► [RHQ] It is not yet time [MTY] to show  that I am the Messiah by working miracles.” <sup>5</sup>Then Jesus’ mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you!” <sup>6</sup>There were six empty stone jars there. The Jews habitually put water in them to use for washing things to make them acceptable to God. Each jar held ◄20 to 30 gallons/80 to 120 liters►. <sup>7</sup>Jesus said to the servants, “Fill the jars with water!” So they filled the jars to the brim. <sup>8</sup>Then he told them, “Now, ladle out some of it and take it ◄to the head waiter/to the master of ceremonies►.” So the servants did that. <sup>9</sup>◄The head waiter/The master of ceremonies► tasted the water, which had now become wine. He did not know where the wine had come from, but the servants who had ladled out the wine knew. The wine was delicious! So he called the bridegroom over, <sup>10</sup>and said to him, “Everyone else serves the best wine first. Then when the guests have drunk so much that they cannot tell the difference, they serve the cheap wine. But you have not done what others do. You have kept the best wine until now!” <sup>11</sup>That was the first miracle that Jesus did. He did it in Cana town, in Galilee district. By doing it he showed how awesome he is, and as a result, we his disciples believed that he truly was the Messiah.</p><p>Jesus and others went to Capernaum and stayed there several days.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Jesus then went down to Capernaum city with his mother and younger brothers and us his disciples. We stayed there several days.</p><p>After Jesus expelled the merchants from the temple, the Jewish leaders wanted him to do a miracle to show by what authority he did that. He told them metaphorically that he would become alive again three days after he died.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Later, when it was almost time for the Jewish Passover celebration, Jesus and we his disciples went up to Jerusalem. <sup>14</sup>There, in the Temple courtyard, he saw some men who were selling cattle, sheep, and pigeons for sacrifices. He also saw men who were sitting at tables, making a big profit as they gave people Temple tax coins in exchange for their Roman coins. <sup>15</sup>Then Jesus made a whip from some cords and used it to chase out the sheep and cattle from the Temple courtyard. By overturning their tables he scattered the coins of the men who were exchanging them. <sup>16</sup>He said to those who were selling doves, “Take these doves away from here! Stop defiling my Father’s Temple by making it a market!” <sup>17</sup>Then we disciples remembered that these words had been written {that someone/David had written these words} in the Scriptures prophesying what the Messiah would say: “Others [PRS] will strongly oppose me because I greatly desire that people respect your Sacred Tent.”</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>So one of the Jewish leaders [SYN] replied to him, “What miracle will you perform to show us that you have authority from God to do these things?” <sup>19</sup>Jesus replied to them, “If/When you destroy this temple, I will build it again within three days.” <sup>20</sup>So the Jewish leaders [SYN] said, “We have been building this Temple for 46 years and it is not finished yet! So ◄there is no way you will build it within three days!/how will you build it within three days?► [RHQ]” <sup>21</sup>But when Jesus said that about the temple, he was really talking about his own body. <sup>22</sup>Later, after Jesus had died and had become alive again, we his disciples remembered the words he had said. As a result, we believed what had been prophesied in the Scriptures about the Messiah becoming alive again, and we believed that what Jesus said was true.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>While Jesus was in Jerusalem at the Passover celebration, many people came to believe that he was the Messiah because they saw the miracles he was performing. <sup>24</sup>But he did not let them tell him what he should do as the Messiah, because he knew within himself what they were all thinking. <sup>25</sup>He did not need anyone to tell him what others were thinking, because he already knew what they were thinking and wanting.</p><a href="#JOHN-c-3"><h3 id="JOHN-c-3">3</h3></a>
<p>Jesus told Nicodemus that people needed to be born again spiritually to have eternal life.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>There was a man named Nicodemus, who was a member of the Jewish religious council. He belonged to the Pharisee religious sect. <sup>2</sup>He went to see Jesus at night, to talk to him about God’s kingdom. He said to Jesus, “Teacher, we believe that you are a teacher who has come from God. We believe this because we know that someone could perform the miracles you are doing only if God were helping him.” <sup>3</sup>Jesus replied to him, “Listen to this carefully: Unless people are born again and have a new life from God, they cannot even see the place where God rules [MET]!” <sup>4</sup>Then Nicodemus said to him, “◄No one can be born when he is old!/How can anyone be born when he is old?► [RHQ] ◄There is no way he can enter his mother’s womb and be born a second time!/How can he enter his mother’s womb and be born a second time?► [RHQ]” <sup>5</sup>Jesus answered, “Note this: Being born naturally is not enough; people need to also be born spiritually by God’s Spirit. If that does not happen, they cannot experience God ruling [MET] their lives. <sup>6</sup>Humans give birth to humans. But those who are born again  as a result of what God’s  Spirit does receive a new  spiritual nature from God. <sup>7</sup>Do not be surprised about my telling you that you must be born again and have a new life from God. <sup>8</sup>Let me illustrate: The wind blows wherever it wants to blow. You hear its sound, but you do not know where the wind comes from or where it is going. Similarly, those who do not know God cannot understand/control/predict how people are born again as a result of what God’s spirit does.” <sup>9</sup>Nicodemus replied to him, “How can that happen?” <sup>10</sup>Jesus replied to him, “You (sg) are a well-known teacher among us Israelite people, so ◄I am surprised that you do not understand these things!/how is it that you do not understand these things?► [RHQ] <sup>11</sup>Listen to this carefully: ◄My disciples and I/I► tell you (pl) about the things that my disciples and I have seen and know are true, but you (pl) do not admit that what my disciples and I are saying is true. <sup>12</sup>I have told you about the things that happen here on earth that are true, but you (pl) do not believe me. So if I tell you (sg) about things that happen in heaven, ◄you certainly will not believe me!/how will you believe me?► [RHQ] <sup>13</sup>I am the only one who has gone up to heaven; no one else has gone up there. I am also the one who came down from heaven. So I know what happens there. <sup>14</sup>Long ago when the Israelite people rebelled against God in the desolate area, God sent poisonous snakes to bite them. But when Moses lifted up on a pole the model of a poisonous snake, everyone who looked at that model was healed from their snake bites. Similarly, even though I am the one who came from heaven, some day people will lift me up on a cross to kill me. <sup>15</sup>As a result, everyone who believes/trusts in me will have eternal life.”</p><p>God sent his Son into the world to save everyone who trusts in him.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>God loved us people [MTY] in the world so much that he gave his only Son as a sacrifice for us, in order that everyone who believes in him would not be separated from God forever. Instead, they would have eternal life. <sup>17</sup>When God sent his Son into the world, his purpose was not to punish the people in [MTY] the world for their sins. Instead, he sent him in order that they might be saved by him {he might save them} from being ◄guilty/punished► for their sins. <sup>18</sup>Everyone who trusts in his Son, God says that they will not be punished {that he will not punish them}. But God has already said that everyone who does not trust in his Son will be punished {that he will punish everyone who does not trust in his Son}, because they have not trusted in what his only Son has done for them. <sup>19</sup>The one who was like a light [MET] to reveal God’s truth to us came into the world. But people loved doing what was evil, like darkness [MET] is evil, instead of loving the one who was like a light. That is the reason God will judge people and condemn them. <sup>20</sup>Everyone who does what is evil hates the one who is like a light, and they will not come to the one who is like a light, because it would be shown {the one who is like a light would show} that their deeds are evil, and he would rebuke them. <sup>21</sup>But those who live according to God’s truth come to the one who is like a light, in order that it may be seen clearly {that people may see clearly} that the things they have done, they did them because they have depended on God.</p><p>When many people began to become Jesus’ disciples, and John the Baptizer declared that Jesus was greater than he, the Jewish leaders rejected John’s and Jesus’ testimony that Jesus was equal to God.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>Some time later Jesus and we disciples went to Judea district. He stayed with us there and directed us as we baptized people.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>John the Baptizer was also baptizing people. He was doing that at Aenon village near Salim town in Samaria district, because there were many springs in that area. Many people kept coming to John and were being baptized {he was baptizing them}. <sup>24</sup>That happened before John was put {they put John} in prison. <sup>25</sup>Then some of John’s disciples and a certain Jew started arguing about the Jewish rituals of washing things to make them acceptable to God. <sup>26</sup>Then those disciples went to John and said to him, “Teacher, do you remember the man who was with you when you were baptizing people on the other side of the Jordan River? He is the one you were telling us about. Well, now he is baptizing people, and many people are going to him instead of coming to us!” <sup>27</sup>John replied, “A person can become important only if God [MTY] permits it. So we should not be jealous about Jesus being popular! <sup>28</sup>You yourselves can verify what I said. I told you that I am not ◄the Messiah/God’s promised king►. Instead, I told you that I was sent {that God sent me} to prepare the way for him. <sup>29</sup>Let me illustrate [MET]: He is like a ◄bridegroom/man who is being married►, and I am like his friend. The friend of the bridegroom stands there and waits for him to come. That friend is very happy when he hears the bridegroom’s voice when he arrives. Similarly, I am very happy about what you have told me. <sup>30</sup>It is necessary for Jesus to become more important by making more disciples than I have, and for me to become less important.”</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>
    Jesus came from heaven. He is more important than anyone else. Those who are born from parents here on earth [MTY] are just humans, and they speak about things that happen here on the earth. But since Jesus came from heaven, his words are more important than anyone else’s. <sup>32</sup>He tells people what he has seen and what he heard in heaven, but very few people [HYP] listen to what he says. <sup>33</sup>Those who have accepted what he has said verify that what God has said is true. <sup>34</sup>We know it is true because Jesus, the one God sent, speaks the message of God. That is also true because God causes his Spirit to live in Jesus to completely direct everything he says and does. <sup>35</sup>God loves his Son, and has caused him to have control/power over everything. <sup>36</sup>Those who trust in God’s Son have eternal life. But those who reject God’s Son will never have eternal life. Instead, God is angry with them and he will surely punish them.</p><a href="#JOHN-c-4"><h3 id="JOHN-c-4">4</h3></a>
<p>John 4:1-30</p><p>While Jesus talked with a Samaritan woman, he showed by his God-given knowledge of her personal life that he is the life-giving Messiah.</p><p>
    <sup>1-2</sup>
    At that time, many people were asking Jesus to baptize them. He did not baptize people; it was we his disciples who were doing the baptizing. But when some of the Pharisee religious group heard people say that Jesus was making more disciples than John the Baptizer and was baptizing them, they became very jealous. <sup>3</sup>When the Lord Jesus heard about that, so that the Pharisees would not cause trouble for him, he left Judea district, and went again with us disciples to Galilee district.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    He knew that God wanted him to travel through Samaria district. <sup>5</sup>So we arrived at a town named Sychar in Samaria district. That was near the plot of ground that our ancestor Jacob had given to his son Joseph long ago. <sup>6-8</sup>The well that used to belong to Jacob was on that plot of ground. Jesus was tired from walking. So while we disciples went into the town to buy some food, he sat down alongside the well. It was about noontime. A woman who lived there in Samaria came to get some water from the well. Jesus said to her, “Will you give me from the well some water to drink?” The woman knew that Jews did not like ◄to touch things that belong to Samaritans/to come near Samaritans►, (OR, Jews did not like to associate with Samaritans,) <sup>9</sup>so the woman said to him, “You are a Jew, and I am from Samaria. Furthermore, I am a woman. So ◄I am surprised that you are asking me for a drink of water!/how is it that you are asking me for a drink of water?► [RHQ]” <sup>10</sup>Jesus replied to her, “If you (sg) knew what God wanted to give you, and if you knew who I am, the one who is asking you for a drink, you would have asked me, and I would have given you water that gives life.” <sup>11</sup>She thought he was talking about ordinary water. So she said to him, “Sir, you do not have a bucket or a rope with which to get water from the well, and the well is deep. So since you cannot get water from this well, where can you get that life-giving water? <sup>12</sup>Our ancestor Jacob left us this well. He drank water from it, and there was enough good water so that his sons and his flocks of sheep and goats drank from it also. Do you claim that you are greater than Jacob, and because of that you can give us life-giving water?” <sup>13</sup>Jesus replied to her, “Everyone who drinks water from this well will later become thirsty again. <sup>14</sup>But those who drink the water that I will give them will never be thirsty again. On the contrary, the water that I give them will become in their inner beings like a spring of water that will enable them to have eternal life.” <sup>15</sup>The woman did not understand that Jesus was speaking figuratively about something that would sustain her spiritually. So she said to him, “Sir, give me that kind of water so that I will not get thirsty again, and so that I will not have to keep returning here to get water!”</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    Jesus knew that she did not understand, but he wanted to show her by his God-given knowledge of her personal life that because he was the Messiah he could supply her spiritual need. So he said to her, “Woman, go and call your husband, and bring him here!” <sup>17</sup>She replied, “I do not have a husband!” Jesus said to her, “You said that you do not have a husband, and that is true. <sup>18</sup>It is also true that you have had five husbands one by one. And the man you are living with now is not your husband! What you have said is very true.”</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>The woman said to him, “Sir, I perceive you must be a prophet because you are able to know people’s secrets. <sup>20</sup>But let me ask you a different question: Our ancestors worshipped God here on Gerizim Mountain, but you Jews say that Jerusalem is the place where we must worship God. So who is right?” <sup>21</sup>Jesus said to her, “Woman, believe me when I say that there will be a time when it will not matter whether you worship God our Father on this mountain or in Jerusalem or somewhere else. <sup>22</sup>You people from Samaria do not know the one you are worshipping. But we (exc) Jews know whom we worship, because it is from us Jews that God has sent the one who will save people from the guilt of their sins. <sup>23</sup>However, there will be a time when those who genuinely worship God will worship him as God’s Spirit directs and according to God’s truth. In fact, that time is now. Those are the kind of worshipers my Father seeks. <sup>24</sup>God is a spiritual being. So it is necessary that those who worship him must worship him as his Spirit directs and according to God’s truth.” <sup>25</sup>The woman said to him, “I know that the Messiah is coming. When he comes, he will tell us everything we need to know.” (‘Messiah’ and ‘Christ’ both mean ‘God’s promised king’.) <sup>26</sup>Jesus said to her, “I, the one speaking to you, am the Messiah!”</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>Just then we disciples returned from town. Since it was contrary to our custom for Jewish religious teachers to converse with a woman they did not know, we were surprised that he was talking to a woman. However, none of us asked her, “What do you want?” and none of us asked him, “Why are you talking with her?”</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>The woman left her water jar there and went into the town. She said to the people there, <sup>29</sup>“Come and see a man who was able to tell me all about my past life [HYP], even though I never met him before Could this man be the Messiah?” <sup>30</sup>So many people left the town and started going to where Jesus was.</p><p>Jesus told his disciples that what sustained him was doing his Father’s will, which meant convincing non-Jewish people to believe in him.</p><p>

    <sup>31</sup>Meanwhile, we disciples were urging him, “Teacher, eat some of the food we brought!” <sup>32</sup>But he said to us, “I have food to eat that you do not know anything about!” <sup>33</sup>So we started saying to each other, “◄Surely no one has brought him any food when we were not here!/Has anyone brought him any food when we were not here?► [RHQ]” <sup>34</sup>Jesus said to us, “Doing what my Father who sent me wants me to do and finishing the work he gave me to do is ◄what sustains me/like my food► [MET]. <sup>35</sup>At this time of the year you are saying (OR, your ancestors used to say), ‘There are four months left before we harvest the crops.’ But I say to you, look carefully at the non-Jewish people around here. God says, ‘They are ready to accept my message [MET], like crops in fields that are ready for people to harvest. <sup>36</sup>If you help them to accept my message, I will reward you [MET], as an owner of a field pays those who harvest the crops. Because of your work, people will gain eternal life.’ I have been telling people God’s message. That is like [MET] a man who plants seeds. You will help people to accept my message. That will be like [MET] harvesting crops. When that happens, both you and I will rejoice. <sup>37</sup>As a result, this saying will become true: One person plants seeds, but others harvest the crops. <sup>38</sup>I am sending you to enable people to accept my message, but you will not be the first ones who tell them God’s message. Others previously worked hard to tell people God’s message, and now you will be harvesting the results of their work.”</p><p>Many Samaritans believed that Jesus was the Messiah.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>39</sup>Many of the Samaria district people who lived in that town believed that Jesus was the Messiah because they heard what that woman said about Jesus, “That man was able to tell me all about my past life [HYP]!” <sup>40</sup>So when those people of Samaria came to Jesus, they urged him to stay with them. So we stayed there two days. <sup>41</sup>Many more of those people believed ◄in Jesus/that he was the Messiah► because of what he said. <sup>42</sup>They told the woman, “We believe in Jesus now, but not just  because of what you told us. Now we have heard him ourselves. And now we know that this man truly is the one who can  save people [MTY] from the guilt of their sins.”</p><p>After Jesus healed an official’s son, the official and his family believed that Jesus is the Messiah.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>43-44</sup>Jesus had said previously that people did not honor prophets like himself when they tried to teach people in their own home area. So, two days later, Jesus and we disciples left that area and went to his own area in Galilee district, because he knew that people there would not think very highly of him, and as a result the Jewish leaders would not be jealous. <sup>45</sup>However, when we arrived in Galilee district, many of the people there welcomed him, because they had been in Jerusalem during the Passover celebration and had seen all the things he did there. <sup>46</sup>Jesus went again to Cana in Galilee district. That was where he previously turned water into wine. There was one of the king’s officials who lived in Capernaum, whose son was very sick. <sup>47</sup>When that man heard others say that Jesus had returned to Galilee district from Judea district, he went to Jesus in Cana and pleaded with him, “Please come down to Capernaum and heal my son, who is about to die!” <sup>48</sup>Jesus said to him, “You people will believe my message only if you see me perform more miracles!” <sup>49</sup>But the official said to him, “Sir, ◄I believe in you/I believe that you came from God►. So please come down to my home before my son dies!” <sup>50</sup>Jesus said to him, “Then you may go home. Your son ◄will live/not die►!” The man believed what Jesus said, and left. <sup>51</sup>The next day while he was on the way home, his servants met him. They told him, “Your child is going to live!” <sup>52</sup>He asked them, “At what time did my son start to become well?” They said to him, “His fever ceased yesterday afternoon at one o’clock.” <sup>53</sup>Then the boy’s father realized that this was the time Jesus told him, “Your son will ◄live/not die►.” So he and all the people in his house believed that Jesus was the Messiah.</p><p>
    <sup>54</sup>That was the second miracle that Jesus performed in Galilee district, after he had returned from Judea district.</p><a href="#JOHN-c-5"><h3 id="JOHN-c-5">5</h3></a>
<p>The Jewish leaders did not like the fact that Jesus healed a paralyzed man on the Sabbath day.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem when the Jews were having another celebration. <sup>2</sup>At one of the gates into the city called the Sheep Gate, there is a pool. In our language we call it Bethzatha. Around the pool were five open areas with roofs over them. <sup>3-4</sup>Many people were lying there. They were people who were blind, lame, or paralyzed.<sup><a href="#footnote-0" id="ref-0">†</a></sup> <sup>5</sup>One of those who was there had been paralyzed for 38 years. <sup>6</sup>Jesus saw him lying there and found out that the man had been like that for a long time. He said to the man, “Do you want to become well?” <sup>7</sup>The paralyzed man replied to him, “Yes, sir, I want to get well, but there is no one to help me get down into the pool when the water is stirred {stirs}. While I am trying to get to the pool, someone else always gets there before me.” <sup>8</sup>Jesus said to him, “Get up! Then pick up your mat and walk!” <sup>9</sup>The man immediately was healed. He picked up his mat and started walking!</p><p>The day on which this happened was a Jewish day of rest. <sup>10</sup>So the Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed, “Today is ◄the Sabbath/our rest day►, and in our Jewish laws it is written that people should not work on our ◄Sabbath/rest day►, so you should not be carrying your mat!” <sup>11</sup>The man replied to them, “The man who healed me, he himself said to me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk!’” <sup>12</sup>They asked him, “Who is the man who said to you, ‘Pick it up and walk!’?” <sup>13</sup>But since Jesus had disappeared in the crowd without telling the man his name, the man did not know who it was who had healed him.</p><p>The Jewish leaders became very angry with Jesus for saying that he was the man who was also God.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>Later, Jesus found the man in the Temple courtyard. He told the man his name, and said to him, “Listen! You are healed! So stop sinning! If you do not stop sinning, something will happen to you that will be worse than the illness you had before!” <sup>15</sup>The man went away and told the Jewish leaders [SYN] that it was Jesus who had healed him. <sup>16</sup>So the Jewish leaders [SYN] started to harass Jesus, because Jesus was doing these things ◄on the Sabbath/on the Jewish rest day►. <sup>17</sup>Then Jesus replied to them, “My Father has always been working every day, including ◄the Sabbath/the day of rest►, up until now. I am doing the same thing!” <sup>18</sup>The Jewish leaders [SYN] considered that he was disobeying their rules about ◄the Sabbath/the day of rest►, and that by saying that God was his Father, he was making himself equal with God. And they considered that both these things were grounds for killing him. So they tried even harder to find a way to kill him.</p><p>Jesus replied to their objections by stating five reasons why they should believe that he is the ◄Son of/man who was also► God.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Jesus replied to them by saying, “You need to know this: I can do nothing by my own authority. I do only the kind of things that I see my Father doing. Whatever kinds of things my Father is doing, those are the things I am doing. <sup>20</sup>My Father loves me, and he shows me everything that he is doing. He will show me the miracles that he wants me to do that will be greater than the ones that you have already seen me do, so that you may be amazed. <sup>21</sup>For example, just like my Father causes people who have died to become alive again, I will give eternal life to everyone that I want to. <sup>22</sup>Furthermore, my Father is not the one who judges people concerning their sins. Instead, he has given to me the work of judging people, <sup>23</sup>in order that all people may honor me, just like they honor my Father. My Father considers that anyone who does not honor me is not honoring him, the one who sent me. <sup>24</sup>Listen to this carefully: Those who hear my message and believe that God is the one who sent me have eternal life. God will not ◄condemn them/say that he will punish them►. They are no longer separated from God. Instead, they have eternal life.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>Listen to this carefully: There will be a time when those who are ◄spiritually dead/separated from God► will hear the voice of me, ◄the Son of God/the man who is also God►. In fact, it is that time already. Those who hear and pay attention to my message will have eternal life. <sup>26</sup>My Father has power to make things live. Similarly, he has given me the power to enable people to live eternally. <sup>27</sup>Because I am the one who came from heaven, he has given me the authority to judge people concerning their sins. <sup>28</sup>Do not be surprised about that, because there will be a time when all people who have died will hear my voice, <sup>29</sup>and they will become alive again. Those who have lived good lives will rise from their graves and live forever. But those who have lived evil lives will rise, and I will ◄condemn them/declare that I will punish them for their sins►. <sup>30</sup>I do not do anything like that by my own authority. I judge people only according to what I hear my Father tell me. I will judge people fairly, because I do not want to please only myself. Instead, I want to please my Father, who sent me.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>If I were the only one to tell people about myself, people could rightly say that what I say is not true. <sup>32</sup>But there is someone else who tells people about me. And I know that what he tells people about me is true. <sup>33</sup>As for you, when you sent messengers to John the Baptizer to ask about me, he told the truth about me. <sup>34</sup>I do not need that people tell others about me. But instead, I am reminding you about what John told people about me, in order that you will believe it and be saved {God will save you}. <sup>35</sup>John’s message about me (OR, John) [MET] was like a lamp that shines brightly. For a short while you were willing to be made happy by that message {to let that message make you happy}.</p><p>
    <sup>36</sup>But there is something else that tells you about me. It should prove who I am more than what John said about me. The miracles [PRS] that my Father told me to do, the miracles that I am performing, show (OR, prove) to people that my Father sent me. <sup>37</sup>Furthermore, my Father, who sent me, tells people about me. You have never heard his voice or seen him. <sup>38</sup>Furthermore, you have not believed in me, the one he sent. So you have not believed his message in your inner beings. <sup>39</sup>You carefully study (OR, Study) the Scriptures, because you think that by studying them you will find the way to have eternal life. And those Scriptures tell people about me! <sup>40</sup>But you refuse ◄to come to me/to believe my message► in order that you may have eternal life.</p><p>
    <sup>41</sup>It does not matter to me whether people praise me. <sup>42</sup>But you want people to praise you. I know that within yourselves you do not love God. <sup>43</sup>Although I have come to earth with my Father’s authority [MTY], you do not accept me. But if someone else comes with his own authority [MTY], you accept him! <sup>44</sup>You accept your praising each other, but you do not try to do things that will result in God himself praising you. So ◄there is no way you can believe in me!/how can you believe my message?► [RHQ]</p><p>
    <sup>45</sup>But do not think that I am the one who will accuse you while my Father is listening! No, it is Moses who will accuse you! You thought that he would defend you. <sup>46</sup>Moses wrote about me, so if you had believed what he wrote, you would have believed what I said <sup>47</sup>But because you did not believe what he wrote about me, ◄you will certainly not believe what I say!/how will you believe what I say?► [RHQ]”</p><a href="#JOHN-c-6"><h3 id="JOHN-c-6">6</h3></a>
<p>Jesus miraculously fed more than 5,000 people.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Some time later, when Jesus was in Galilee district, near the time of the Jewish Passover celebration, Jesus went with us disciples by boat and crossed to another place along Galilee Lake. This lake is also called Tiberias Lake. <sup>2</sup>A large crowd of people kept following Jesus on land because they had been seeing the miracles he performed by healing sick people. <sup>3</sup>Jesus went up on the hillside and sat down with us disciples to teach us. <sup>4</sup>Then he looked up and saw a great crowd of people coming toward him. <sup>5</sup>He said to Philip, “Where will we buy food for all these people to eat?” <sup>6</sup>He asked this only to find out if Philip believed what Jesus could do, because Jesus already knew what he himself was going to do. <sup>7</sup>Philip replied to him, “Even if we had the amount of money a man earns in eight months, that would not be enough to buy bread so that each person could have a little bit!” <sup>8</sup>Another one of us disciples, Andrew, who was Simon Peter’s younger brother, said to Jesus, <sup>9</sup>“There is a boy here who has five small barley loaves and two cooked fish. But ◄they will not help much among so many people!/what good will that do among so many people?► [RHQ]” <sup>10</sup>Jesus said, “Tell the people to sit down!” There was plenty of grass there, so they all sat down comfortably. There were about 5,000 men among the crowd. <sup>11</sup>Then Jesus took the small loaves and the fish and thanked God for them. Then he gave them to us, and we distributed the small loaves and the fish to all the people sitting on the ground. Because God caused the food to keep increasing, everyone ate as much as they wanted. <sup>12</sup>When everyone had all the food they wanted, he said to us disciples, “Gather up the pieces that are left over. Do not let anything be wasted!” <sup>13</sup>So we gathered up the pieces of the small loaves that were left over by those who had eaten. We filled twelve baskets with those pieces!</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>After the people saw that miracle that Jesus had performed, many of them started to say, “Surely this is the prophet like Moses that God promised to send to the world!” <sup>15</sup>So, because Jesus realized that they were about to come and seize him to make him their king, he left them again and went up into the hills by himself.</p><p>Jesus miraculously walked on the water.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>When it was evening, we disciples went down to Galilee Lake. <sup>17</sup>When it became dark and Jesus had still not joined us, we got into a boat and went across the lake towards Capernaum city. <sup>18</sup>A strong wind started to blow and caused the water ◄to become very rough/to have high waves►. <sup>19</sup>After we had rowed ◄three or four miles/five or six kilometers►, we saw Jesus coming near the boat; he was walking on the water! So we were terrified! <sup>20</sup>But he said to us, “Do not be afraid! It is I!” <sup>21</sup>We were glad to take him into the boat. As soon as we did that, the boat reached the shore where we were going!</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>The next day the crowd of people that had stayed on the other side of the lake were perplexed about how Jesus had left that area. They knew that there had been only one boat there the previous day. They knew that we had gone away in it by ourselves. They knew that Jesus had not gone with us. <sup>23</sup>Then some men came from Tiberias city in boats. They were hoping to take some of the crowd back to Tiberias. They arrived near the place where the people had eaten the food after Jesus had given thanks and caused it to multiply. <sup>24</sup>When the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor we disciples were there, some of them got into those boats and they sailed to Capernaum to find Jesus.</p><p>Jesus taught them figuratively of the need for them to take for themselves the benefits of his sacrificing himself and shedding his blood to atone for their sins.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>When they found him in Capernaum further around the lake, they asked him, “Teacher, since you(sg) did not come in a boat, when and how did you get here?” <sup>26</sup>Jesus replied to them, “Listen to this carefully: Do you know why you are looking for me? It is not because you saw me perform miracles and as a result have realized who I really am. No! You are looking for me only because you had plenty of bread to eat after I provided it for you by performing a miracle. <sup>27</sup>Stop desiring food that will soon spoil! Instead, desire to get spiritual food that will last forever! Yearn for eternal life! That is what I, the one who came from heaven, will give you. God my Father has shown that he approves of me enabling me to do that.”</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>Then the people asked him, “What things should we do to please God?” <sup>29</sup>Jesus replied, “What God wants you to do is this: He wants you to believe that I am the one he has sent.” <sup>30</sup>So they said to him, “Then perform another miracle so that we may see it and believe that you came from God. What miracle would you like to perform? <sup>31</sup>Our ancestors ate the food called manna that God provided for them by a miracle in the desolate area. This is written {The Psalmist wrote this} in the Scriptures about what Moses caused to happen: ‘He gave them food from heaven to eat.’ Will you perform a miracle like that?”</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>So Jesus said to them, “The truth is that it was not Moses who gave your ancestors that food from heaven. No, it was my Father who gave it to them. And my Father is the one who gives you the true food from heaven. <sup>33</sup>The true bread from God came down from heaven, and he is the one who will give eternal life to the people of the world [MTY].”</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>
    Not understanding what he meant, they said to him, “Sir, give us that kind of bread all the time!” <sup>35</sup>Jesus said to them, “Just like food [MET] sustains physical life, I am the one who enables you to have spiritual life. Those who eat ordinary food and drinks will later be hungry and thirsty. But those who come to me to receive that life will never again lack anything spiritually. <sup>36</sup>I told you before that you have seen my miracles, but after seeing them, instead of understanding who I am, you have not believed in me. <sup>37</sup>All the people that my Father entrusts to me will come to me, and I will certainly ◄welcome/never send away► [LIT] anyone who comes to me. <sup>38</sup>When I came down from heaven, it was not to do what I want. Instead, I came to do what ◄God/my Father►, who sent me, wants. <sup>39</sup>What the one who sent me wants is that I ◄keep forever all/never lose any► [LIT] of those whom he has entrusted to me. He wants me to cause all of them to become alive again ◄on the last day/on the day when I judge everyone► [MTY]. <sup>40</sup>Long ago in the desolate area when those who were bitten by snakes looked at the bronze replica of a snake, they were healed [MET]. What my Father wants is that similarly everyone who looks at what I have done and believes in me will have eternal life. I will cause them to become alive again ◄on the last day/on the day when I judge everyone► [MTY].”</p><p>
    <sup>41</sup>The Jewish leaders [SYN] began to grumble about him because he said, “I am the one who is like true bread who came down from heaven.” <sup>42</sup>They said, “◄This man is Jesus, the son of Joseph!/Isn’t this man the son of Joseph?► [RHQ] We know the names of both his father and his mother. He certainly did not come from heaven, so ◄he is lying by saying ‘I came from heaven.’/why is he now saying, ‘I came from heaven?’► [RHQ]” <sup>43</sup>Jesus replied to them, “Stop grumbling among yourselves about what I just said! <sup>44</sup>My Father, who sent me, makes people want to come to me. No others will come to me to receive eternal life. Those who come to me are the only ones who will believe in me. I will ◄cause them to be alive again/raise them from the dead► ◄on the last day/on the judgment day►. <sup>45</sup>It was written ◄by one of the prophets/by the prophet Isaiah► {◄One of the prophets/The prophet Isaiah► wrote} about all those who will trust in me, ‘God will teach them all.’ Everyone who listens to what my Father says and learns from him will ◄come to/believe in► me. <sup>46</sup>I came from God. I am the only one who has seen my Father. No one else has seen him. <sup>47</sup>Listen to this carefully: Everyone who believes ◄my message/in me► has eternal life. <sup>48</sup>Just like food [MET] sustains your physical life, I am the one who enables you to have spiritual life. <sup>49</sup>Even though your ancestors ate the manna while they were traveling in the desolate area, they died anyway. <sup>50</sup>But the bread I am talking about is something that came down from heaven. If people eat that bread, their spirits will never die. <sup>51</sup>I am the one who came down from heaven to enable people to have spiritual life. If people take what I will give them, they will live forever. What I will give them is my flesh, which I will give to all the people in [MTY] the world in order that they may have spiritual life.”</p><p>
    <sup>52</sup>Then the Jewish leaders [SYN] began to argue among themselves. They said, “◄There is no way this man can give us his flesh to eat!/How can this man give us his flesh to eat?►” [RHQ] <sup>53</sup>So, speaking figuratively of the need for them to accept for themselves the benefits of his sacrificing himself and shedding his blood to atone for their sins [MET], Jesus said to them, “Listen carefully to this: Although I am the one who came from heaven, if you do not eat my flesh and drink my blood, you will not have eternal life. <sup>54</sup>Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life, and I will cause them to become alive again at ◄the last day/the judgment day►, <sup>55</sup>because my flesh and my blood are truly spiritual food. <sup>56</sup>Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood will have a close relationship with me, and I will have a close relationship with them. <sup>57</sup>My Father, who is the source of everything that lives, sent me, and I live because my Father has given me life. Similarly those who eat my flesh will live eternally because of what I do for them. <sup>58</sup>I am the true bread that came down from heaven. Although our ancestors ate manna, they later died anyway. But those who eat this bread will live forever.” <sup>59</sup>He said this while he was teaching people in ◄the synagogue/the Jewish meeting place► in Capernaum.</p><p>Some of Jesus’ disciples left him because of this teaching.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>60</sup>After they heard him say that, many of his disciples said, “What he is teaching is hard to understand; ◄it is very difficult for anyone to accept it!/how can anyone accept it?► [RHQ]” <sup>61</sup>Jesus was aware that his disciples were grumbling about it, so he said to them, “◄I am sorry that this is offending you./Is this offending you?► [RHQ] <sup>62</sup>◄Perhaps you will believe my message if you see me, the one who came from heaven, ascending there to where I was before!/(What will you think if you see me, the one who came from heaven, ascending there to where I was before)?► [RHQ] <sup>63</sup>God’s Spirit is the one who gives people eternal life. Human efforts are no help at all for giving people eternal life. The message I have spoken to you gives spiritual life (OR, comes from God’s Spirit and gives eternal life.) <sup>64</sup>But there are some of you who do not believe my message.” Jesus said that because he knew from the time he started [MTY] his ministry which of them would not believe his message. He also knew who would ◄betray him/enable his enemies to seize him►.</p><p>
    <sup>65</sup>Then he continued by saying, “That is why I told you that only those whom my Father has enabled to believe in me will come to me and receive eternal life.”</p><p>
    <sup>66</sup>From that time, many of his disciples left him and no longer went with him. <sup>67</sup>So he said to us twelve apostles, “You do not want to leave me also, do you?” <sup>68</sup>Simon Peter replied to him, “Lord, we will not leave you, because ◄there is no other person like you to whom we can go!/what other person is there like you to whom we can go?► [RHQ] You have the message about eternal life! <sup>69</sup>We have come to believe for certain that you are the holy one who has come from God!” <sup>70</sup>Then Jesus replied to us, “You are saying that as though all you twelve men whom I have chosen [RHQ] believe that. But one of you is under the control of Satan!” <sup>71</sup>He was talking about Judas, the son of Simon, from Kerioth village. Even though Judas was one of us twelve apostles, he was about ◄to betray Jesus/to enable Jesus’ enemies to seize him►.</p><a href="#JOHN-c-7"><h3 id="JOHN-c-7">7</h3></a>
<p>Jesus rejected his younger brothers’ suggestion that he go immediately to Jerusalem.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>After those things happened, Jesus went around in Galilee province. He did not want to travel in Judea province, because he knew that the Jewish leaders there were wanting to kill him. <sup>2</sup>But when the time of the Jewish celebration called ‘Celebration of Living in Shelters’ was near, <sup>3</sup>Jesus’ younger brothers said to him, “Since many people here have left you, you should leave and go to Judea province and perform some miracles there, so that your disciples may see them! <sup>4</sup>No one who wants to become famous does things secretly. You say you are doing these miracles, so do some miracles there so that everyone [MTY] can see them!” <sup>5</sup>They said this critically, because even though they were his own younger brothers, they did not believe he was from God. <sup>6</sup>So Jesus said to them, “It is not yet time for me [MTY] to go to the celebration. For you, any time is right to go to the celebration. <sup>7</sup>The people [MTY] who ◄do not believe in me/do not belong to God► cannot hate you, but they hate me because I tell them that what they are doing is evil. <sup>8</sup>You (pl) go ahead to the celebration. I am not going up to Jerusalem to the celebration yet, because now is not the right time for me to go.” <sup>9</sup>After he said that, Jesus stayed a little longer in Galilee.</p><p>Jesus went to the celebration.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>However, a few days after his younger brothers left to go up to the celebration, he went also. He went, along with us disciples, but no others went with us. <sup>11</sup>At the celebration, the Jewish leaders were looking for him. They were asking people, “Has Jesus come?” <sup>12</sup>Among the crowds, many people were whispering about Jesus. Some were saying, “He is a good man!” But others were saying instead, “No! He is deceiving the crowds!” <sup>13</sup>But no one was speaking so that others could hear them, because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders [SYN].</p><p>After Jesus taught people, the Jewish leaders wanted to arrest him, but many others believed he was the Messiah.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>In the middle of the days of the celebration, Jesus went to the Temple courtyard and began to teach people. <sup>15</sup>The Jewish elders were amazed at what he was saying. They said, “This man never studied in one of our religious schools! So ◄how can he have learned so much about Scripture?/it is difficult for us to believe that he has learned so much about Scripture!► [RHQ]” <sup>16</sup>Jesus replied to them, “What I teach does not come from myself. It comes from God, the one who sent me. <sup>17</sup>Those who choose to do what God wants will find out whether what I teach comes from God or whether I am speaking with only my own authority. <sup>18</sup>Those who speak with only their own authority do that only so that others will honor them. But I am doing things so that others will honor the one who sent me, and I am someone who speaks the truth. I never lie. <sup>19</sup>Think about the laws that Moses gave you [RHQ]. None of you completely obeys those laws. So why are you trying to kill me, saying I do not obey the laws concerning ◄the Sabbath/the Jewish day of rest►?”</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>Someone in the crowd answered, “By saying this you show that you are crazy (OR, A demon is controlling you)! Certainly no one is trying to kill you!” <sup>21</sup>Jesus replied to them, “Because I did a miracle of healing someone ◄on the Sabbath/on the Jewish rest day►, you are all shocked. <sup>22</sup>Moses gave you a law that you must circumcise the male children and that you must do that exactly seven days after they are born. Actually, it was your ancestors, Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, not Moses, who started that ritual. But because of that law, you sometimes circumcise them ◄on the Sabbath/on the Jewish rest day►, but that is working, too <sup>23</sup>You sometimes circumcise boys ◄on the Sabbath/on the Jewish rest day► so that the law of Moses is not disobeyed {you do not disobey the law of Moses}, so ◄it is ridiculous that you are angry with me, saying I worked ◄on the Sabbath/on the Jewish rest day► by healing a man!/why are you angry with me, saying I worked ◄on the Sabbath/on the Jewish rest day► by healing a man?► [RHQ] Healing someone is far more helpful than circumcising a baby boy! <sup>24</sup>Stop deciding whether my healing this man is wrong according to what you see! Instead, decide according to what is really the right action to help people”!</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>Some of the people from Jerusalem were saying, “◄This is the man that they are trying to kill!/Isn’t this the man that they are trying to kill?► [RHQ] <sup>26</sup>He is saying these things ◄publicly/in front of many people►, but our Jewish rulers are not saying anything to oppose him. Is that because they have decided that he is truly ◄the Messiah/God’s chosen king►? <sup>27</sup>But he cannot be the Messiah, because we know where this man came from. When the Messiah really comes, no one will know where he comes from.”</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>
    They said that because they thought Jesus was born in Nazareth. So while Jesus was teaching people in the Temple courtyard, he shouted, “Yes, you say that you know me, and you think you know [IRO] where I am from. But I have come here not ◄because I appointed myself/with my own authority►. Instead, God is the one who truly sent me. You do not know him. <sup>29</sup>But I know him, because I have come from him. He is the one who sent me!”</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>Then they tried to seize him because he said that he had come from God. But no one put their hands on him to do that, because it was not yet the time [MTY] for him to die. <sup>31</sup>But many of the crowd believed that he had come from God. They said, “When the Messiah comes, he certainly will not do more miracles than this man has done, will he?” <sup>32</sup>The Pharisees heard them whispering these things about him. So they and the chief priests sent some Temple guards to seize him.</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>Then Jesus said, “I will be with you for only a short time. Then I will return to the one who sent me. <sup>34</sup>Then you will search for me, but you will not find me. And you will not be able to come to the place where I am.” <sup>35</sup>So the Jewish leaders [SYN] said to themselves, “Where is this man about to go with the result that we will not be able to find him? Some Jewish people have dispersed and live among Greek people. He is not intending to go and live among them and teach them, is he? <sup>36</sup>When he said ‘You will search for me, but you will not be able to find me,’ and when he said ‘You will not be able to come to the place where I am,’ what did he mean?”</p><p>Many people were divided after Jesus said that the Spirit would produce eternal life within those who come to him.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>37</sup>
    On each of the seven days of the celebration, the high priest poured out some water on the altar in the Temple to remember how God provided water for the people in the desolate area long ago. But the water he poured did not help anyone who was thirsty. So on the last day of the festival, which was the most important day, Jesus stood up in the Temple courtyard and said with a loud voice, “Those who are thirsty should come to me to drink what I will give them. <sup>38</sup>Just like the Scriptures teach, streams of water shall flow out from within those who believe in me, and that water will cause them to live eternally.” <sup>39</sup>When Jesus said that, he was referring to God’s Spirit, whom those who believed in Jesus would receive later. Up to that time God had not sent the Spirit to live within believers, because Jesus had not yet died and returned to his glorious home in heaven, from where he would send the Spirit.</p><p>
    <sup>40</sup>When some of the crowd heard those words, they said, “Surely this man is the prophet whom God promised to send who would be like Moses!” <sup>41</sup>Others said, “He is the Messiah!” But others, thinking Jesus was born in Galilee, said, “The Messiah will not come from Galilee province, will he? <sup>42</sup>◄Did a prophet not write in the Scriptures that the Messiah will come from King David’s family, and be born in Bethlehem, where King David lived?/It is written in the Scriptures that the Messiah will come from King David’s family, and be born in Bethlehem, where King David lived!► [RHQ]” <sup>43</sup>So the people were divided because of what they thought about Jesus. <sup>44</sup>Some people wanted to seize him, but no one tried to do that.</p><p>
    <sup>45</sup>So the Temple guards returned to the chief priests and the Pharisees, the ones who had sent them to arrest Jesus. They said to the guards, “Why did you not seize him and bring him here?” <sup>46</sup>They replied, “No one ever spoke such amazing things as this man does!” <sup>47</sup>Then the Pharisees replied, “Have you been deceived {Has he deceived you}, too? <sup>48</sup>◄None of our rulers nor any of us Pharisees have believed that &lt;he is the Messiah!/he came from God!&gt;/Have any of our Jewish rulers or any of us Pharisees believed that &lt;he is the Messiah?/he came from God?&gt;► [RHQ] <sup>49</sup>Not one! But, on the contrary, some of this crowd have believed in him. They do not know the true teachings of our laws! They will go to hell for listening to him!”</p><p>
    <sup>50</sup>Then Nicodemus spoke. He was the one who earlier went to Jesus at night. He was also a member of the Jewish council. He said to the rest of the Council members, <sup>51</sup>“We have not listened to what he says to find out what he is doing. ◄It is not permitted in our Jewish law [PRS] for us to say, before questioning someone, that we must punish him!/Is it permitted in our Jewish law [PRS] for us to say, before questioning someone, that we must punish him?► [RHQ]” <sup>52</sup>They replied to him, “◄Are you another disgusting person from Galilee?/You talk like another disgusting person from Galilee!► [RHQ] Read what is written in the Scriptures You will find that no prophet comes from Galilee province, like he does!” <sup>53</sup>[Then they all left and went to their own homes.</p><a href="#JOHN-c-8"><h3 id="JOHN-c-8">8</h3></a>
<p>Jesus evaded a trap about condemning a woman who had been caught committing adultery.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>But Jesus went with us disciples to Olive Tree Hill and we stayed near there that night. <sup>2</sup>Early the next morning, we returned to the Temple courtyard. Many people gathered around Jesus, so he sat down to teach them. <sup>3</sup>Then men who taught the Jewish laws and some of [SYN] the Pharisee religious group brought a woman to him. She was seized {They had arranged to seize her} while she was having sex with a man who was not her husband. They made her stand up in front of the group that was listening to Jesus. <sup>4</sup>Then they said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was seized {we seized this woman} while she was having sex with a man who is not her husband. <sup>5</sup>Moses commanded us in the laws that he gave us that we should throw stones at such women and kill them. So what do you say we should do?” <sup>6</sup>They asked this question as a trap so that they could accuse him. If he said that they should not kill her, they would shame him for disobeying the law of Moses. If he said that they should kill her, they could accuse him to the Roman governor.</p><p>But Jesus bent down and wrote something on the ground with his finger. <sup>7</sup>While they continued to question him, he stood up and said to them, “Whichever one of you has never sinned can be the first one to start throwing stones at her.” <sup>8</sup>Then he stooped down and wrote some more on the ground. <sup>9</sup>After they heard what he said, those who were questioning him went away, one by one, the older ones first and then the younger ones, knowing they were all sinners. Finally only Jesus was there, along with the woman. <sup>10</sup>Jesus stood up and asked her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one said you must die for your sin?” <sup>11</sup>She said, “No, sir, no one.” Then Jesus said, “I do not condemn you either. Go home now, and do not continue your sinful life any longer!”]</p><p>Jesus replied to the Pharisees’ objection to his claim to be like a light for the people of the world.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Jesus spoke to the people again. He said, “I am like a light [MET] for all the people in [MTY] the world. Just like a light reveals what has been in the darkness [MET], I reveal God’s truth to them. Those who walk in the darkness are unaware of what is around them. But those who become my disciples will always be aware of God’s truth [MET]. They will have my light which shows them how to have eternal life.” <sup>13</sup>So the Pharisees said to him, “You are just telling about yourself! Since there is no one else to verify these things that you say about yourself, we do not need to accept that what you say is true.” <sup>14</sup>Jesus replied, “Even if I were the only one to say these things about myself, what I say is true, because I know that I came from heaven, and I know that I am going back to heaven. But you do not know where I came from or where I am going. <sup>15</sup>You judge people according to human standards. The reason that I am here is not ◄to condemn people/to say that I will punish people► for their sins. <sup>16</sup>But if I did judge people, what I decided would be correct, because I am not the only one who will decide those things. I and the one who sent me will both decide. <sup>17</sup>It is written {Moses wrote} in your law that if at least two people testify that some event has happened, people should consider that what they say is true. <sup>18</sup>I am telling you about myself, and the other one who is telling you about me is my Father who sent me. So you should believe that what we declare is true.”</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Then they asked him, “If you have a father whom we can question about you, where is he?” Jesus replied, “You do not know who I really am. If you knew who I really am, you would know who my Father is also.” <sup>20</sup>He said these things when he was in the Temple courtyard, near the place where the people put their offerings. This was also very close to the place where the Jewish council met. But no one seized him to arrest him, because it was not yet time [MTY] for him to suffer and die.</p><p>Jesus replied to the Pharisees’ continued rejection of Jesus’ claims about himself.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>Jesus also said to them, “I will soon be going away. Then at the end of your life you will seek me, but you will die without God forgiving your sins. Where I will go, you will not be able to come.” <sup>22</sup>So the Jewish leaders said among themselves, “Is he going to kill himself? Is that the reason that he said, ‘Where I go, you will not be able to come’?” <sup>23</sup>But Jesus continued by saying to them, “You were born here in this world, but I came from heaven. You belong to those who are opposed to God [MTY]. I do not belong to them. <sup>24</sup>I told you that you will die without God forgiving your sins. If you do not believe that I am who I say that I am, you will die without God forgiving your sins.”</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>So they said to him, “You! Who do you think you are?” Jesus said to them, “Ever since I began teaching, I have been telling you who I am! <sup>26</sup>I could judge you and say that you are guilty of many things. But instead, I will say only what the one who sent me tells me to say. What he says is true, and I tell the people in the world [MTY] what I have heard from him.”</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>They did not understand that he was talking about his Father in heaven. <sup>28</sup>So Jesus said, “I am the one who came down from heaven, but when you lift me up on a cross to kill me, you will know who I am. You will also know that I do not do anything with my own authority. Instead, I say just what my Father has taught me. <sup>29</sup>He is the one who sent me, and he helps me. Because I always do the things that please him, he has never abandoned me.” <sup>30</sup>As Jesus was saying these things, many people believed that he was ◄from God/the Messiah►.</p><p>Jesus told his critics which people were true believers like Abraham and which ones really were serving Satan.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>Then Jesus said to the Jews who now said they believed in him, “If you continue to live in accordance with my message, you will truly be my disciples. <sup>32</sup>Then you will know God’s truth, and as a result of your believing his truth, he [PRS] will free you from being controlled by the one who has made you his slaves.” <sup>33</sup>They replied to him, “We are descendants of Abraham. We have never been anyone’s slaves. So why do you say we will be freed from being someone’s slaves?” <sup>34</sup>Jesus replied, “Listen carefully to what I am going to tell you. All those who continue to sin are forced to obey their sinful desires [MET], just like a slave is forced to obey his master. <sup>35</sup>A slave is not a permanent member of a family. But a son is a member of a family forever. Similarly, you say you are members of God’s family because you are descendants of Abraham, but really, because you are like slaves of your sinful desires, you are no longer permanent members of God’s family. <sup>36</sup>So if you allow me to free you, you will truly be free. <sup>37</sup>I know that you are Abraham’s descendants. But you are trying to kill me because you are not allowing [PRS] my message to continue to change your inner being. <sup>38</sup>I am telling you what I saw when I was with my Father. But you do the things that you have heard from your father.”</p><p>
    <sup>39</sup>They replied to him, “Abraham is our ancestor.” Jesus said to them, “If you were Abraham’s descendants, your character would be like Abraham’s character, and you would do good things like Abraham did. <sup>40</sup>I have been telling you the truth that I heard from God, but you are trying to kill me. Abraham did not do things like that. <sup>41</sup>No! You are doing the things that your real father does.”</p><p>They said to him, “We do not know about you, but we are not illegitimate children. And spiritually, we have only one Father. That is God, and you do not know who your father is!” <sup>42</sup>Jesus said to them, “If God were your father, you would love me, because I came from God, and now I have come here to this world. My coming was not ◄because I appointed myself/with my own authority►. He sent me. <sup>43</sup>◄And I will tell you why you do not understand what I say./Do you know why you do not understand what I say?► [RHQ] It is because you do not want to accept my message. <sup>44</sup>You belong to your father, ◄the devil/Satan►, and you desire to do what he wants. He has caused people to become murderers from the time when people first sinned. He has abandoned God’s truth because he is a liar by his nature. Whenever he lies, he is speaking according to his nature, because he is a liar and is the one who originates [MET] all lies. <sup>45</sup>But because I tell you the truth, you do not believe me! <sup>46</sup>Since I have never sinned, ◄none of you can show that I have sinned./can anyone among you show that I have sinned?► [RHQ] So, since I tell you the truth, ◄there is no good reason for your not believing me!/why is it that you do not believe me?► [RHQ] <sup>47</sup>Those who belong to God habitually obey God’s message. You do not belong to God, so you do not obey his message.”</p><p>
    <sup>48</sup>The Jewish leaders [SYN] replied to him, “◄We are certainly right by saying that you believe what is false as the Samaritans do!/Are we not right by saying that you believe what is false as the Samaritans do?► [RHQ] And that ◄a demon/an evil spirit► controls you!” <sup>49</sup>Jesus replied, “A demon does not control me! I honor my Father, and you do not honor me! <sup>50</sup>I am not trying to honor myself. There is someone else who desires to honor me, and he is the one who will judge whether it is I who am telling the truth or whether it is you who are telling the truth. <sup>51</sup>But the truth is that anyone who obeys what I say will never die!”</p><p>
    <sup>52</sup>Then the Jewish leaders [SYN], thinking that he was talking about ordinary death and not about spiritual death, said to him, “Now we are sure that a demon controls you! Abraham and the prophets died long ago! But you say that anyone who obeys what you teach will never die! <sup>53</sup>◄You are certainly not greater than our ancestor Abraham!/Do you think you are greater than our ancestor Abraham?► [RHQ] He died, and all the prophets died, so who do you think you are by saying something like that?” <sup>54</sup>Jesus replied, “If I were honoring myself, that would be worthless. My Father is the one who you say is your God. He is the one who honors me. <sup>55</sup>Although you do not know him, I know him and have a close relationship with him. If I said that I did not know him, I would be a liar like you are. But I know him, and I obey what he says. <sup>56</sup>Your ancestor Abraham was happy when he thought about what I would do during my life [MTY]. It was as though he saw that, and was happy.”</p><p>
    <sup>57</sup>Then the Jewish leaders [SYN] said to him, “You are not 50 years old yet! So ◄you certainly did not see him!/how could you have seen him?► [RHQ] Because he died long ago!” <sup>58</sup>Jesus said to them, “The truth is that I existed before Abraham was born!” <sup>59</sup>So, because they were very angry about Jesus thus saying that he ◄had eternally existed/was equal with God►, they picked up stones to throw at him to kill him. But Jesus caused them not to be able to see him, and he left the Temple courtyard.</p><a href="#JOHN-c-9"><h3 id="JOHN-c-9">9</h3></a>
<p>Jesus healed a man who was born blind.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>As Jesus walked along with us, he saw a man who had been blind from the time he was born. <sup>2</sup>We disciples asked him, “Teacher, was this man blind from when he was born because his parents sinned or because he himself sinned?” <sup>3</sup>Jesus replied, “His being blind was not because he or his parents sinned. Instead, he has been blind in order that people can see the power of God {the power of God can be seen} as a result of what will now happen to him. <sup>4</sup>While there is still time, I must do the work that the one who sent me wants me to do. Just like daytime is followed by nighttime when people do not work, at the end of our lives [MET] it is too late for us to do what God wants. <sup>5</sup>While I am still living in this world, I am the one who enables people to know about God, like [MET] a light enables the people in [MTY] this world to see what is in the darkness.”</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>After he said that, he spat on the ground. He made a little bit of mud with the saliva, and put it on the man’s eyes. <sup>7</sup>Then he said to him, “Go and wash in Siloam pool!” (That name means ‘sent;’ just like they sent the water by a channel into the pool, God sent Jesus). So the man went and washed in the pool, and when he went home he was able to see! <sup>8</sup>His neighbors and others who previously had seen him when he was begging said, “He is the man who used to sit here and beg, isn’t he?” <sup>9</sup>Some said, “Yes, he is.” Others said, “No, he is not. It is just a man who looks like him!” But the man himself said, “Yes, I am that man!” <sup>10</sup>So they said to him, “How is it that now you can see?” <sup>11</sup>He replied, “The man whose name is Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. Then he told me to go to Siloam pool and wash. So I went there and washed, and then I could see.” <sup>12</sup>They said to him, “Where is that man now?” He said, “I do not know.”</p><p>The Pharisees investigated the healing of the blind man.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>They took to the Pharisees the man who was previously blind. <sup>14</sup>The day on which Jesus made the mud and enabled the man to see again was a ◄Sabbath/Jewish day of rest►. The Pharisees considered that healing someone was work, and their rules did not permit people to do any work ◄on the Sabbath/on the Jewish rest day►. <sup>15</sup>So the Pharisees also asked that man, “How did you become able to see?” He said to them, “The man put mud on my eyes. Then I washed, and now I can see!” <sup>16</sup>So some of the Pharisees said, “Since this man Jesus disobeys our rules about working ◄on the Sabbath/on the Jewish rest day►, he is not from God.” But others said, “If he was a sinner, ◄he could certainly not do such miracles!/how could he do such miracles?► [RHQ]” So they were divided. <sup>17</sup>So one of them said to the blind man again, “You are the man whom he enabled to see. What do you yourself say about him?” The man said, “I think he is a prophet!” So they told him to go.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>The Jewish leaders [SYN] still did not believe that the man was blind when he was born, and that he was now able to see. So they sent someone to bring the man’s parents. <sup>19</sup>When they got there, one of the Jewish leaders asked them, “Is that man your son? Do you say that he was blind when he was born? If that is true, how is he now able to see?” <sup>20</sup>His parents replied, “We know that he is our son. We know that he was blind when he was born. <sup>21</sup>But we do not know how he is able to see now. We also do not know who enabled him to see. Ask our son! He is old enough to answer questions from authorities like you He can tell you himself!” <sup>22</sup>The Jewish leaders [SYN] had previously declared that they would prevent anyone who declared that Jesus was the Messiah from entering their synagogues. His parents knew that, so they were afraid of the Jewish leaders [SYN]. <sup>23</sup>That is the reason that they said, “He is old enough to answer questions, so ask him!”</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>So they sent someone to bring back to them the man who had been blind. When he got there, the Jewish leaders said to him, “Knowing that God is listening [IDM], tell the truth! We know that the man who healed you is a sinner.” <sup>25</sup>He replied, “I do not know if he is a sinner or not. But one thing I do know is that I was blind, but now I can see!” <sup>26</sup>So they said to him, “What did he do to you? How did he enable you to see?” <sup>27</sup>He replied, “I told you that already, but you did not [RHQ] pay attention! Why do you want to hear me tell you again? ◄Do you also want to become his disciples?/You talk as though [IRO] you also want to become his disciples [RHQ]►.” <sup>28</sup>Then they insulted him angrily. They said, “You are that man’s disciple, but we are Moses’ disciples! <sup>29</sup>We know that God spoke to Moses; but this man, we do not know where he is from or where he gets any authority from!” <sup>30</sup>The man replied, “That is very surprising! You say that you do not know where he gets any authority. But he enabled me to see! <sup>31</sup>We know that God does not help sinners who ask God to help them. Instead, he listens to and helps godly people who pray. He listens to people who do what God wants. <sup>32</sup>No one has ever enabled a man to see who was blind when he was born like I was. That has never happened since the world began! <sup>33</sup>So if this man had not come from God, he would not be able to do anything like that!” <sup>34</sup>They replied to him, “You ◄were born as a result of your parents’ sin [EUP]/bastard►! ◄Do you think you are qualified to teach us?/You are not qualified to teach us!► [RHQ]” Then they threw him out of the synagogue.</p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>Jesus heard people say that they had thrown that man out. He found the man and said to him, “Do you believe that the one who came down from heaven is the Messiah?” <sup>36</sup>The man answered, “Sir, who is he? Tell me, in order that I may believe in him.” <sup>37</sup>Jesus said to him, “You have seen him. In fact, it is I, the one who am speaking to you.” <sup>38</sup>The man said, “Lord, I believe that you are the Messiah!” Then he knelt down before Jesus and worshipped him.</p><p>
    <sup>39</sup>Jesus said, “I have come into this world to judge the people in the world. The result will be that those who realize that they do not know God’s truth will perceive it. That is like [MET] enabling those who are blind to see. But the result will also be that people who falsely think [IRO] that they understand God’s truth will never understand it. That is like [MET] people who are blind remaining blind permanently.” <sup>40</sup>Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard him say that, and said to him, “You are not suggesting that we are like blind people, are you?” <sup>41</sup>Jesus said to them, “If you realized that you did not yet know God’s truth, but you wanted to, then you would be like blind people who wanted to see. God would be able to forgive your sins. But you are now falsely claiming that you know God’s truth, so you are like people who are blind who claim that they can see. Because of that, God is not able to forgive your sins.”</p><a href="#JOHN-c-10"><h3 id="JOHN-c-10">10</h3></a>
<p>Jesus explained why he is like a good shepherd.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Jesus continued by saying to us, “Listen carefully to what I say. Anyone who does not enter the sheep pen through the gate, if he climbs in some other way, he is a thief or a bandit. <sup>2</sup>The man who enters the pen through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep. <sup>3</sup>The man who watches the gate at night opens the gate for him. The sheep recognize the shepherd’s voice. He summons his own sheep by calling out the names he has given them. Then he leads them outside the pen. <sup>4</sup>After he has brought out all his own sheep, he goes in front of them. His sheep follow him because they recognize and pay attention to his voice. <sup>5</sup>But they will never follow a stranger. Instead, they will run away from him, because they do not recognize a stranger’s voice.”</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Jesus said that [MET] to illustrate the difference between himself and the Pharisees, who were deceiving the people. But they did not understand what he was telling them. <sup>7</sup>So Jesus spoke to them again. He said, “Listen carefully to what I am saying. I am like [MET] a gate for the sheep to enter the sheepfold, because I am the one who allows people to enter God’s presence. <sup>8</sup>All of your religious leaders who have come previously without my authority are like [MET] thieves and bandits because they act violently and dishonestly for their own benefit. But just like sheep do not obey strangers, God’s people do not pay attention to them. <sup>9</sup>I am like a gate. Those will be saved {God will save all those} who come to God by trusting in me. Just like sheep go in and out through the gate safely to find pasture [MET], I will provide for them and protect them. <sup>10</sup>Thieves come to a sheep pen only to steal or kill or destroy sheep [MET]. Similarly, your religious leaders injure God’s people spiritually. But I have come in order that people may have eternal/spiritual life, and that they may have abundantly all they need to sustain them spiritually.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>I am like a good shepherd. A good shepherd is willing to die to save the sheep [MET]. Similarly, I am ready to sacrifice myself to save those who belong to me. <sup>12</sup>A worker whom someone has hired to look after the sheep is not like the shepherd or the one who owns the sheep. So when he sees a wolf coming, he leaves the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock of sheep and seizes one sheep and causes the others to scatter. <sup>13</sup>The worker runs away because he is only a man whom someone has hired. He is not really concerned about what happens to the sheep [MET]. Similarly, your religious teachers do not really care what happens to you. <sup>14</sup>I am like a good shepherd. Just like a good shepherd knows his sheep [MET], I know those who belong to me, and they know me <sup>15</sup>in the same way as my Father knows me and I know my Father. Furthermore, I am ready to sacrifice myself for those who belong to me. <sup>16</sup>And I have other people who are not Jews who will some day belong to me. They will be like [MET] sheep from another sheep pen. I must bring them to God/myself also. They will pay attention to what I say, and eventually all those who belong to me will be like one flock, and I will be like [MET] their one shepherd. <sup>17</sup>The reason my Father loves me is that I will sacrifice my life. But after I do that, I will become alive again. <sup>18</sup>No one is causing me to die. Instead, I have chosen to sacrifice myself. I have authority to sacrifice myself and I have authority to become alive again. That is what my Father has commanded me to do.”</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>After hearing these words that Jesus said, the Jews were divided again. <sup>20</sup>Many of them said, “A demon is controlling him and has caused him to become crazy. ◄It is useless to listen to him!/Why should we listen to him?► [RHQ]” <sup>21</sup>But others said, “What he is saying is not something a man whom a demon is controlling would say. ◄No demon could enable a blind man to see like he did!/ How could a demon enable a blind man to see like he did?► [RHQ]”</p><p>The Jewish leaders tried to kill or arrest Jesus for claiming that he was equal with God.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>Then it was time for the celebration to remember when our ancestors rededicated the Temple in Jerusalem. It was in winter. <sup>23</sup>Jesus was in the Temple courtyard, walking in the place that people called King Solomon’s porch. <sup>24</sup>The Jewish leaders [SYN] gathered around him and said, “How long will you keep us from knowing for sure if you are the Messiah? If you are the Messiah, tell us clearly!” <sup>25</sup>Jesus answered them, “I have told you that I am the Messiah, but you do not believe me! You should know who I am because of the miracles I do with my Father’s authority [MTY]. <sup>26</sup>But instead, you do not believe in me because you do not belong to me. You are like [MET] sheep who belong to a different shepherd. <sup>27</sup>Just like sheep heed the voice of their true shepherd [MET], my people pay attention to what I say. I know them, and they have become my disciples. <sup>28</sup>I will give them eternal life. No one will separate them from me, not ever. No one shall ever pull them away from belonging to me. <sup>29</sup>Those that my Father has given to me are more precious than anything else (OR, My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than anything that opposes them). So no one can pull them away from belonging to him [MTY]. <sup>30</sup>My father and I are equal.”</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>The Jewish leaders [SYN] again picked up stones to throw at Jesus and kill him because they were angry at his saying that he was equal with God. <sup>32</sup>But Jesus said to them, “You have seen me perform many miracles that my Father told me to do. You should realize from seeing them that I am equal with God. So, because of which of these miracles [IRO] are you wanting to kill me by throwing stones at me?” <sup>33</sup>The Jewish leaders [SYN] replied, “We are wanting to throw stones at you not because you performed a great miracle. Instead, we are wanting to do it because you are dishonoring God. You are just a man, but you are saying that you are God!” <sup>34</sup>Jesus replied to them, “In the Scriptures it is written {◄someone/the Psalmist► has written} [RHQ] what God said to the rulers whom he had appointed, ‘I have said that you are like gods.’ <sup>35</sup>God said that to those leaders when he appointed them. No one objected to that. And nothing that is in Scripture can be set aside {no one can set aside anything that is in Scripture}. <sup>36</sup>But I am the one my Father set apart to completely belong to him. He sent me here into this world. So ◄why are you angry with me for saying that I am equal with God when I say that I am the man who is also God?/you should not be angry with me for saying that I am equal with God when I say that I am the person who is both God and man!► [RHQ] <sup>37</sup>If I were not doing the miracles that my Father told me to do, I would not expect you to believe in me. <sup>38</sup>But because I perform these miracles, believe what these miracles show about me, even though you do not believe what I say. If you do that, then you will know and understand that my Father has a close relationship with me, and I have a close relationship with my Father.”</p><p>
    <sup>39</sup>After they heard that, they tried to seize him again, but he got away from them.</p><p>
    <sup>40</sup>Then Jesus went, along with us, back across to the east side of the Jordan River. We went to the place where John was previously baptizing people. He/We stayed there for a few weeks. <sup>41</sup>Many people came to Jesus. They were saying, “John never performed a miracle, but this man has performed many miracles! Everything that John said about this man is true!” <sup>42</sup>Many people who came there believed ◄that Jesus was the Messiah/that Jesus truly had come from God►.</p><a href="#JOHN-c-11"><h3 id="JOHN-c-11">11</h3></a>
<p>Jesus’ friend, Lazarus, died.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    One time there was a man whose name was Lazarus who was very sick. He lived in Bethany village, where his older sisters Mary and Martha also lived. <sup>2</sup>Mary was the woman who later poured perfume on the feet of the Lord Jesus, and then wiped his feet with her hair. <sup>3</sup>So the two sisters sent someone to tell Jesus about Lazarus, saying, “Lord, the one you love very much is very sick.” <sup>4</sup>They hoped that Jesus would come, but when Jesus heard the message, he said, “His being sick will not end in his dying. Instead, it will result in people realizing how great God is, and that I, God’s son, may be honored {that people may honor me, God’s son}, because of what I will do.” <sup>5</sup>Jesus loved Martha and her younger sister Mary and Lazarus. <sup>6</sup>But when Jesus heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was for two more days.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>But Jesus wanted to see Lazarus. So he said to us disciples, “Let’s go back to Judea.” <sup>8</sup>We said, “Teacher, just a short while ago the Jewish leaders [SYN] wanted to kill you by throwing stones at you. So ◄we think that you should not go back there again!/are you sure that you want to go back there again?► [RHQ]” <sup>9</sup>To show us that nothing bad could happen to him until the time that God had chosen [MET], Jesus replied, “There are [RHQ] twelve hours in the daytime, which is enough time to do what God wants us to do. People who walk in the daytime will not stumble over things they cannot see, because they see things by the light from the sun. <sup>10</sup>It is when people walk in the nighttime that they stumble over things, because they have no light.”</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>After he said that, he told us, “Our friend Lazarus has gone to sleep. But I will go there so that I can wake him up.” <sup>12</sup>So we said to him, “Lord, if he is sleeping, he will get well. So you do not need to risk your life by going there.” <sup>13</sup>Jesus was speaking figuratively about Lazarus’ death, but we thought that he was talking about really being asleep. <sup>14</sup>So then he told us plainly, “Lazarus is dead. <sup>15</sup>But for your sake I am glad that I was not there when he died, because I want you to believe more firmly that I ◄am the Messiah/came from God►. So now, instead of staying here, let’s go to him.” <sup>16</sup>Then Thomas, who was {whom they} called ‘The Twin’, said to the rest of us disciples, “Let’s all go, so that we may die with Jesus when his enemies kill him.”</p><p>Lazarus’ sisters expressed disappointment that Jesus did not come and heal Lazarus before he died.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>When we arrived close to Bethany, someone told Jesus that Lazarus had died and had been buried and his body had been in the tomb for four days. <sup>18</sup>Bethany is less than ◄two miles/three kilometers► from Jerusalem. <sup>19</sup>Many Jews had come from Jerusalem to console Martha and Mary over the death of their younger brother. <sup>20</sup>When Martha heard someone say that Jesus was coming, she went along the road to meet him. But Mary stayed in the house. <sup>21</sup>When Martha got to where Jesus was, she said to him, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died because you would have healed him! <sup>22</sup>But I know that even now God will do for you whatever you ask concerning my brother.” <sup>23</sup>Jesus said to her, “Your brother will become alive again!” <sup>24</sup>Martha said to him, “I know that he will become alive again when all people become alive again on the Judgment day.” <sup>25</sup>Jesus said to her, “I am the one who enables people to become alive again and who causes people to live eternally. Those who believe in me, even if they die, will live again. <sup>26</sup>Furthermore, all those who believe in me while they are alive, their souls will not die forever. Do you believe that?” <sup>27</sup>She said to him, “Yes, Lord! I believe that you are the Messiah, ◄the Son of God/the man who is also God►. You are the one God promised to send into the world!”</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>After she said that, she returned to the house and took her younger sister, Mary, aside and said to her, “The Teacher is close to our village, and he wants to talk to you.” <sup>29</sup>When Mary heard that, she got up quickly and went to him. <sup>30</sup>Jesus had not yet entered the village; he was still at the place where Martha met him. <sup>31</sup>The Jews who were in the house with Mary, consoling her, saw Mary get up quickly and go outside. So they followed her, thinking that she was going to the tomb where they had buried Lazarus, in order to cry there.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>When Mary got to where Jesus was and saw him, she prostrated herself at his feet and said, “Lord, if you had been here, my younger brother would not have died!” <sup>33</sup>When Jesus saw her crying, and saw that the Jews who had come with her were also crying, he was very angry that Satan had caused Lazarus to die (OR, very troubled) and disturbed in his spirit. <sup>34</sup>He said, “Where have you buried ◄him/his body►?” They said to him, “Lord, come and see.” <sup>35</sup>Jesus began to cry. <sup>36</sup>Then some of the Jews said, “Look how much he loved Lazarus!” <sup>37</sup>But some others said, “He enabled a blind man to see. So ◄he should have been able to heal this man so that he did not die!/why did he not heal this man so that he did not die?► [RHQ]”</p><p>
    <sup>38</sup>Within himself Jesus was again very angry about Lazarus dying (OR, very troubled). He came to the tomb. It was a cave. The entrance had been covered with a large stone. <sup>39</sup>Jesus said, “Take away the stone!” Martha, who, as I mentioned before, was an older sister of the man who had died, said, “Lord, his body has been in the tomb for four days, so now there will be a bad smell!” <sup>40</sup>Jesus said to her, “I told [RHQ] you that if you believed in ◄me/what I can do►, you would see how great God is! Have you forgotten that?”</p><p>Jesus caused Lazarus to be alive again.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>41</sup>So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up toward heaven and said, “My Father, I thank you that you heard me when I prayed about this earlier. <sup>42</sup>I know that you always hear me when I pray. But instead of just praying silently, I said that for the sake of the people who are standing here. I want them to believe that you sent me.” <sup>43</sup>After he said that, he shouted, “Lazarus, come out!” <sup>44</sup>The man who had been dead came out! The strips of cloth were still wrapped around his hands and feet, and a cloth was still around his face, but he came out! Jesus said to them, “Take off the cloths so that he can walk easily!” So they did that.</p><p>
    <sup>45</sup>As a result, many of the Jews who had come to see Mary and who had seen what Jesus did, believed that he ◄was the Messiah/had come from God►. <sup>46</sup>But some of the others went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. <sup>47</sup>So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered all the members of the Jewish Council together. They started saying to each other, “What are we going to do about Jesus? He is performing many miracles! <sup>48</sup>If we allow him to keep doing this, everyone will believe ◄in him/that he is the Messiah►, and they will make him their king. Then the Roman army will come and destroy our Temple and our whole nation of Israel!”</p><p>The Jewish leaders decided to kill Jesus.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>49</sup>One of the Jewish Council members was Caiaphas. He was the Jewish high priest that year. Hinting that they should get rid of Jesus, he said to them, “You talk as though you do not know anything [HYP]! <sup>50</sup>You do not realize that it would be much better for us if one man died for the sake of the people rather than that the Romans kill all the people of our Jewish nation.” <sup>51</sup>He said that, not because he thought of it himself. Instead, since he was the high priest that year, he was prophesying that Jesus would die for the whole Jewish nation. <sup>52</sup>But he was also prophesying that Jesus would die, not just for the Jews, but for all the people living in other lands who would belong to God, in order that he would unite all of them into one group. <sup>53</sup>So from that day the Jewish leaders started to make plans how they could kill Jesus.</p><p>
    <sup>54</sup>Because of that, Jesus no longer traveled around publicly among the Jewish people. Instead, he left Jerusalem, along with us disciples, and went to a village called Ephraim, in an area near the desolate region. We stayed there for a while.</p><p>
    <sup>55</sup>When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover celebration, many Jews went up to Jerusalem from other places in the country. They went there to perform the rituals to make themselves acceptable to God before the Passover celebration started. <sup>56-57</sup>The Jewish chief priests and Pharisees issued an order that if anyone found out where Jesus was, that person should report it to them, in order that they could seize him. So the people thought that Jesus would probably not dare to come to the celebration. But they kept looking for him, and as they were standing in the Temple courtyard they were saying to each other, “What do you think? He will not come to the celebration, will he?”</p><a href="#JOHN-c-12"><h3 id="JOHN-c-12">12</h3></a>
<p>A woman anointed Jesus with perfume</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Six days before the Passover celebration started, Jesus arrived in Bethany village, along with us. That was where Lazarus lived. He was the man Jesus previously caused to be alive again after he died. <sup>2</sup>There they gave a dinner to honor Jesus. Martha served the meal. Her younger brother, Lazarus, was among the people who were eating with Jesus. <sup>3</sup>Then Mary took a bottle of expensive perfume called nard and poured it on Jesus’ feet to honor him. Then she wiped his feet with her hair. The whole house was filled with the beautiful smell of the perfume.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, (OR, Judas, the man from Kerioth Town) objected. He was the one who later enabled Jesus’ enemies to seize him. <sup>5</sup>He said, “◄We should have sold this perfume and given the money to poor people!/Why did we not sell this perfume and give the money for it to the poor people?► [RHQ] We could have gotten 300 days’ wages for it!” <sup>6</sup>He said that, not because he cared about the poor people, but instead, because he was a thief. He was the one who kept the bag of funds that people gave to help Jesus and us his disciples, and he often stole some of the money that was {that people} put into it. <sup>7</sup>Then Jesus said, “Do not bother her! She bought this perfume in order to save it until the day when they will bury me after I die. <sup>8</sup>There will always be poor people among you, so you can help them whenever you want to. But I will not be with you much longer, so it is good that she showed right now how much she appreciates me.”</p><p>The Jewish leaders decided to kill Lazarus, too.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>A large crowd of Jews heard people say that Jesus was there in Bethany. So they came, not only to see Jesus but also to see Lazarus, the man whom he had caused to become alive again after he died. <sup>10</sup>So the chief priests decided to kill Lazarus also, <sup>11</sup>because many of the Jews were deserting them and going to Jesus and believing in him because of Jesus causing Lazarus to be alive again.</p><p>Jesus entered Jerusalem as a king, but a humble one.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>The next day the huge crowd of people that had come to Jerusalem for the Passover celebration heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. <sup>13</sup>So they cut branches from some palm trees and took the branches out of the city to wave them when they met him. Some of them were shouting things like, “Hooray!” “May the Lord God bless the one who is coming with his authority [MTY]!” Some other people were shouting, “May God bless the King of Israel!” <sup>14</sup>When Jesus came near to Jerusalem, he got a young donkey and sat on it as he rode into the city. By doing this, he fulfilled what had been written {what a prophet had written} in Scripture,</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>You people of Jerusalem,</p><p>do not be afraid!</p><p>Look! Your king is coming!</p><p>He is riding on a donkey’s colt!</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>At first we disciples did not understand those things. But after Jesus had returned to heaven, we realized that those things had been written {that a prophet had written those things} about him, and that by doing those things for him the people had fulfilled what the prophet prophesied.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>The crowd that was with him continued to tell other people that he called Lazarus to come out of the tomb, and that Lazarus had then become alive again. <sup>18</sup>Because of that, many people, because they heard others say that he had performed this miracle, went to meet him. <sup>19</sup>So the Pharisees said to each other, “It is obvious that we are making no progress in trying to stop him! It looks like [HYP] everyone [MTY] is becoming his disciple!”</p><p>Jesus told some Greeks what people who wanted to be his disciples had to be ready to do.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>Among those who went up to Jerusalem to worship God during the Passover celebration were some Greeks. <sup>21</sup>They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida town in Galilee province. They wanted him to do something for them. They said, “Sir, we would like to talk with Jesus.” <sup>22</sup>So after Philip went and told that to Andrew, they both went and told Jesus. <sup>23</sup>Then, to show them that he must die in order to give eternal life to non-Jews like those Greeks, Jesus replied to them, “It is time for God to honor me, the one who came from heaven. That will happen when I die. <sup>24</sup>Listen to this carefully: My life is like a seed [MET]. If someone does not plant a kernel of grain in the ground, it does not change. It remains only one seed. But if it changes after it is planted in the ground, it will grow and produce many seeds. <sup>25</sup>Anyone who strongly wants to keep on living here on earth will surely lose his life forever. But anyone who is willing to die [HYP] for my sake will surely gain eternal life. <sup>26</sup>If any of these Greeks or anyone else wants to serve me, they must become my disciples. Then, after they die, they will be where I am, in heaven. My Father will honor all those who serve me.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>Now I am deeply disturbed. ◄I do not know what to say./What shall I say?► [RHQ] Should I say, ‘My Father, save me from this time when I will suffer and die!’? No, I should not say that, because the reason I came ◄into this world/from heaven► was that I would suffer [MTY] now. <sup>28</sup>My Father, show how great you are!”</p><p>God encouraged Jesus about his coming death by a voice from heaven.</p><p>
    </p><p>Then God spoke [EUP] from heaven, saying, “I have already shown how great I am, and I will do it again!” <sup>29</sup>The crowd that was there heard it but they did not understand the words. Some said it was thunder. Others said an angel had spoken to him. <sup>30</sup>Jesus replied to them, “The voice that you heard speaking was God’s voice, but it was not for my benefit. It was for your benefit! <sup>31</sup>Now is the time for God to judge the people in [MTY] the world. Now is the time when I will destroy the power of Satan, the one who rules this world. <sup>32</sup>But as for me, when I am lifted {when men lift me} up from the ground on a cross, I will make a way for gathering everyone to myself.” <sup>33</sup>He said this to show us the way in which he was going to die.</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>
    Someone in the crowd answered him, “We understand from the Scriptures that the Messiah will live forever. So why do you say that the one who came from heaven, who is the Messiah, will be lifted up {that men will lift up the one who came from heaven, who is the Messiah,} on a cross? What kind of man who came from heaven are you talking about? (OR, That’s not the kind of Messiah we are expecting!)” <sup>35</sup>Then Jesus said to them, “My message is like [MET] a light for you. I will be with you for only a little while longer. Live and act as you should while I am still with you, because suddenly you will have no more opportunity to hear my message! You do not want to be like [MET] someone who cannot see where he is going any more when it suddenly becomes dark! <sup>36</sup>Believe in my message [MET] while you still have an opportunity to do it, in order that you may become people who have accepted my truth [MET]!”</p><p>Most of the Jewish leaders continued to reject Jesus’ message.</p><p>
    </p><p>After Jesus said those things, he left them and hid from them. <sup>37</sup>Although he had done many miracles while people were watching, most of them refused to believe that he is ◄the Messiah/from God►. <sup>38</sup>Their stubbornness and refusal to believe was similar to the stubbornness of the people that the prophet Isaiah wrote about long ago:</p><p>Lord, ◄hardly anyone has believed our message!/who has believed our message?► [RHQ]</p><p>Most people refused to accept it,</p><p>even though you showed them your power!</p><p>
    <sup>39</sup>That was the reason why they were unable to believe. It was like Isaiah wrote somewhere else that God said:</p><p>
    <sup>40</sup>They have refused to understand; they acted as though they were blind people!</p><p>They were insensible in their inner beings!</p><p>As a result, they have not perceived my truth!</p><p>They have not understood it in their inner beings!</p><p>They have not turned from their sinful lives,</p><p>and because of that I cannot help them!</p><p>
    <sup>41</sup>Isaiah wrote that because it was as though he saw ahead of time how great Jesus would be, and he prophesied those things about him.</p><p>
    <sup>42</sup>Although most of the Jewish leaders [SYN] did not believe that Jesus is ◄the Messiah/from God►, some of them believed in him. But they would not tell anyone that they believed in him, because they were afraid that if they said that, the Pharisees would not let them worship in the synagogues. <sup>43</sup>They wanted people to praise them more than they wanted God to praise them.</p><p>Jesus warned that God would condemn those who rejected his message.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>44</sup>
    Another day, when Jesus was teaching the people, he shouted, “Those who believe in me, they are not believing in me alone. Instead, it is as though they also believe in the one who sent me. <sup>45</sup>When they see me and what I am doing, it is as though they are seeing the one who sent me. <sup>46</sup>I have come into the world to show people God’s truth, as a light shows people what is around them. I have come in order that people who believe in me will not remain ignorant of God’s truth [MET], as those who are in the darkness are ignorant of what is around them.</p><p>
    <sup>47</sup>As for those who hear my message but do not obey its commands, I am not the one who judges them. The main reason that I came ◄into the world/from heaven► was not to judge the people of [MTY] the world. Instead, I came to save them from being punished for their sins. <sup>48</sup>There is something that will judge those who reject me and do not accept my message. On the judgment day God will condemn them because they rejected the message that I have told them. <sup>49</sup>I have not said things from my own authority. Instead, my Father, the one who sent me, instructed me what to say and how I should say it. <sup>50</sup>I know that paying attention to what he has instructed us leads to eternal life. So whatever I say is exactly (OR, only) what my Father has told me to say.”</p><a href="#JOHN-c-13"><h3 id="JOHN-c-13">13</h3></a>
<p>Jesus washed the disciples’ feet as an example of humble service to each other.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>When it was the evening before the Passover celebration, Jesus knew that it was time for him to leave this world and to return to his Father in heaven. He loved us who were his disciples. He knew we would continue to live here in this world, so now he showed us how completely he loved us. <sup>2</sup>We were eating the Passover meal. ◄The devil/Satan► had already suggested to Judas Iscariot (OR, Judas, the man from Kerioth Town), the son of Simon, that he should ◄betray Jesus/enable Jesus’ enemies to seize him►. <sup>3</sup>But Jesus knew that his Father had given to him complete authority to control the situation. He knew that he had come from God and would soon return to God. <sup>4</sup>But before he left us, he wanted to show us how we should love each other. So he got up from where he was eating. He took off his outer cloak and wrapped a long towel around his waist, as a slave would do. <sup>5</sup>Then he poured some water in a basin. He began to wash our feet, and then dry them with the towel that he had wrapped around himself.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>When he came to Simon Peter, Peter said to him, “Lord, it is not right for you [RHQ] to humble yourself by washing my feet!” <sup>7</sup>Jesus replied to him, “Now you do not understand the meaning of what I am doing, but you will understand later.” <sup>8</sup>Peter said, “I will never, ever, allow you to wash my feet!” Jesus replied to him, “If I do not wash you, you cannot continue ◄to be my disciple/to belong to me►.” <sup>9</sup>So Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, in that case, do not wash only my feet. Wash my hands and my head, too!” <sup>10</sup>Then, to show him that after God had cleansed people from being guilty for sin, they needed only for God to forgive their daily sins [MET], Jesus said to him, “Those who have recently bathed need only to have their feet washed, because they get dirty very quickly on the dusty roads. The rest of their bodies are clean. Similarly, I have made you disciples free/clean from the guilt of your sins, although not all of you are free from guilt.” <sup>11</sup>He knew which one of us was going to betray him. That is the reason he said, “Not all of you are free from guilt.”</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>After he finished washing our feet, he put his cloak back on. Then he sat down and said to us, “Do you understand what I have done for you? <sup>13</sup>You show that you respect me by calling me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord’. You are right to say that, because I am your teacher and your Lord. <sup>14</sup>But if I, who am your teacher and your Lord, have washed your feet, you ought to serve each other by doing things like washing each other’s feet. <sup>15</sup>I have made myself an example for you in order that you should humbly serve each other as I have done for you. <sup>16</sup>Listen to this carefully: A servant is not greater than his master. A messenger is not greater than the one who has sent him. So, since you are not greater than I am, you should not be proud and unwilling to serve each other. <sup>17</sup>Since you now know these things, God will be pleased with you if you do them.”</p><p>Jesus predicted that one of them would betray him to his enemies.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>“I am not saying that God will bless all of you. I knew what all of you were like when I chose you. But I also chose the one who will betray me, in order that what is written in Scripture might be fulfilled {to fulfill what someone/the psalmist wrote in Scripture}, ‘The one who is acting like he is my friend by eating with me has become my enemy [IDM].’</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>I am telling you about someone betraying me before it happens, in order that when it happens, you may continue to believe that I am ◄the Messiah/who I say I am►. <sup>20</sup>Listen to this carefully: Those who accept any one of you whom I am sending out, God will consider that they are accepting me. And those who accept me, God will consider that they are accepting my Father, who sent me.”</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>After Jesus said this, he was very troubled. He solemnly declared, “Listen to this carefully: One of you is going to enable my enemies to seize me.” <sup>22</sup>We looked at each other. We had no way to know whom he was talking about. <sup>23</sup>I, the man other people call ‘the one Jesus loved’, was sitting very close to Jesus. <sup>24</sup>Simon Peter motioned to me to indicate that I should ask Jesus whom he was talking about. <sup>25</sup>So I leaned close to Jesus and asked him, “Lord, who is it?” <sup>26</sup>Jesus answered, “It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread after I dip it in the sauce in the dish.” Then, to show us that he knew who would enable his enemies to seize him, after he dipped the bread in the sauce, he gave it to Judas Iscariot (OR, Judas, the man from Kerioth Town). <sup>27</sup>As soon as Judas ate the bread, Satan took control of him. Then Jesus said to him, “What you are going to do, do quickly.” <sup>28</sup>But none of the rest of us who were sitting there knew why Jesus said that to him. <sup>29</sup>Since Judas took care of the money people gave us to help us, some thought Jesus was telling him to go and buy some things we needed for the Passover celebration. Some thought he was telling him to give some money to poor people. <sup>30</sup>As soon as Judas had eaten the bread, he left. It was dark outside, and it was dark [MET] in his soul, too.</p><p>Jesus commanded his disciples that they should love each other.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>After Judas left, Jesus said, “Now it will be shown {my Father will show} how wonderful I, the one who came from heaven, am. And by what I do it will be seen {people will see} how great God is. <sup>32</sup>Since by what I do people will see how awesome God is, God himself will show people how awesome I am. And he will do that very soon.</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>
    You whom I love as though you were my children, I will continue with you only a short time longer. Then you will look for me, but I will not be here. Just like I told the Jewish leaders [SYN], I am telling you now, that where I am going, you cannot come yet. <sup>34</sup>Now I am giving you a new commandment: You must love each other. You must love each other in the way that I have loved you. <sup>35</sup>If you keep loving each other, everyone who is aware of that [HYP] will know that you are my disciples.”</p><p>Jesus also prophesied that Peter would deny that he knew Jesus.</p><p>

    <sup>36</sup>Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, where are you going?” Jesus replied, “The place where I am going, you cannot come with me now, but you will come there later.” <sup>37</sup>Peter said, “Lord, why can I not come with you now? I am ready to die for you!” <sup>38</sup>Jesus answered, “You say [RHQ] that you are ready to die for me. But the truth is that before the rooster crows early tomorrow morning, you will say three times that you do not know me!”</p><a href="#JOHN-c-14"><h3 id="JOHN-c-14">14</h3></a>
<p>Jesus encouraged his disciples and told them that he is the only way to the Father.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Jesus continued by saying to us, “Stop being anxious/worried. Keep on trusting in God (OR, You are trusting in God); also keep trusting in me. <sup>2</sup>Where my Father is in heaven there is plenty of room! If that were not true, I would have told you. I am about to go there to prepare a place for you. <sup>3</sup>And because I will go there and prepare a place for you, I will return and take you there to be with me. I will do that so that you may also be where I am. <sup>4</sup>You know the road to the place where I am going.”</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Thomas said to him, “Lord, we do not know where you are going. So how can we know the road?” <sup>6</sup>Jesus said to him, “I am the road [MET] to where my Father is. I am the one who reveals [MET] the truth about God and the one who gives eternal life to people. I am the only one who can enable people to come to my Father. There is no other way. <sup>7</sup>If you really knew who I was, you would have known my Father also. From now on, you know him, and it is as though you have seen him.”</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Philip said to him, “Lord, show us your Father and that will be enough for us!” <sup>9</sup>Jesus said to him, “Philip, I have been with you for a long time. So ◄surely you should know who I really am!/why have you not come to know who I really am?► [RHQ] Those who have seen me, it is as though they have seen my Father. So ◄why do you say ‘Show us your Father’?/you should not say ‘Show us your Father’!► [RHQ] <sup>10</sup>Do you not [RHQ] believe that I have a close relationship with my Father, and that my Father has a close relationship with me? The messages that I tell you do not come from me. They come from my Father, who has a close relationship with me. He is enabling me to teach these things, and to perform the miracles that he wants me to perform. <sup>11</sup>Believe that I have a close relationship with my Father and that my Father has a close relationship with me. If you do not believe that just because of what I say, believe it because of the miracles themselves that I have done. <sup>12</sup>Listen to this carefully: You who trust in me will do the kinds of miracles that I have done. Because of what I will do for you (OR, Because I will send God’s Spirit to you) after I go to my Father, you will be able to do miracles that will be greater than the ones I have done. <sup>13</sup>And whatever you, using my authority, ask me to do, I will do it, in order that I can show you how great my Father is. <sup>14</sup>Anything that you ask my Father to do, anything that you ask with my authority [MTY], I will do.”</p><p>Jesus promised to send the Holy Spirit to them.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>“If you love me, you will do what I have commanded you. <sup>16</sup>Then I myself will request my Father, and he will send you someone else who will ◄encourage/be like a legal counsel for► you. <sup>17</sup>I am talking about the Spirit, who will teach you God’s truth. He will be with you forever. Those who are opposed to God [MTY] cannot receive him, because they cannot understand what he does, and they cannot know who he is. But you know who he is, because he is with you and he will be inside you. <sup>18</sup>When I leave you, I will not let you be alone/helpless [MET]. When I send the Spirit, it will be like I am coming back to you (OR, When I rise from the dead, I will come back to you.) <sup>19</sup>Soon those who do not belong to God [MTY] will not see me any more. But when the Spirit comes to you, it will be as though you will be seeing me again (OR, But after I become alive again, you will see me again.) Because I will be alive again, you also will have eternal life. <sup>20</sup>At that time you will know that I have a close relationship with my Father, and you will have a close relationship with me, and I will have a close relationship with you. <sup>21</sup>Those who have accepted my commands and obey them are the people who love me. My Father will love those who love me. I also will love them, and I will fully reveal to them what I am like.”</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>Then Judas spoke to him. He was not Judas Iscariot (OR, Judas, the man from Kerioth Town), but instead a disciple whose other name was Thaddeus. He said, “Lord, what has happened so that you can fully reveal to us what you are like, and not reveal that to those who do not belong to God [MTY]?” <sup>23</sup>Jesus replied to him, “Those who love me will obey what I have told them. My Father will also love them. It is those people whom my Father and I will be able to come to and ◄live with/have a personal relationship with►. <sup>24</sup>But those who do not love me will not obey what I have told them. So I cannot reveal to them what I am really like.</p><p>These words that I am telling you have not come just from me. They came from my Father, the one who sent me. <sup>25</sup>I have told you all these things while I am still with you. <sup>26</sup>But my Father will send the Holy Spirit. He is the one who will ◄encourage/be like a legal counsel for► you. He will come with my authority [MTY]. He will teach you all of God’s truth that you need to know. He will also cause you to remember all the things that I have told you. <sup>27</sup>As I leave you, I am causing you to have inner peace. This inner peace comes from me. I am not causing you to have something that those who do not belong to God [MTY] can give you. So stop being anxious/worried, and do not be afraid.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>You heard me say to you, ‘I am going away, but later I will come back to you.’ If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going back to my Father, because my Father is greater than I am, and there he will honor me and will send the Spirit to you. <sup>29</sup>I have told you these things now before they happen, so that when they happen you will believe that what I said is true. <sup>30</sup>I will not be able to talk to you much longer, because what happens to me will be as though Satan, the ruler of this world, is coming to attack me. But he has no control over what happens to me. <sup>31</sup>Instead, the people who do not belong to God [MTY] must learn from what happens to me that I love my Father, and I am doing the things that he has commanded me to do. Now, let’s get up and leave here.”</p><a href="#JOHN-c-15"><h3 id="JOHN-c-15">15</h3></a>
<p>Jesus taught them that they needed to remain closely united to him in order to live in a way that would please God.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Jesus talked to us as we were walking along. Speaking figuratively of the need for us to live in a way that God wants us to, he said, “I am like [MET] a genuine vine, not like those Jewish leaders who do not teach the truth. My father is like [MET] a gardener who works to take care of a vineyard. <sup>2</sup>Just like a gardener cuts off the branches that bear no grapes [MET], God gets rid of those who do not please him even though they say that they belong to him. Those branches that bear fruit, the gardener trims so that they may bear more grapes. Similarly, my Father disciplines/corrects those who live as he wants them to live. <sup>3</sup>You are already like the branches that a gardener trims because you have believed the message that I have told you. <sup>4</sup>Remain having a close relationship with me. If you do that, I will remain having a close relationship with you. A branch of a vine cannot bear fruit if it is cut off and left by itself. To bear fruit, it must remain attached to the vine. Similarly, you cannot live the way that God wants you to if you do not remain united to me [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>I am like [MET] a vine. You are like [MET] the branches. All those who have a close relationship with me and with whom I have a close relationship will do much that pleases God, like [MET] a vine that bears much fruit. Remember that you can do nothing [HYP] that truly pleases God without my help. <sup>6</sup>A gardener cuts off and throws away useless branches. Then, after they dry up, he picks them up and throws them into a fire and burns them [SIM]. Similarly, everyone who does not remain having a close relationship with me, God will get rid of. <sup>7</sup>If you remain having a close relationship with me and you keep living in accordance with my message, you can ask God to do anything for you, and he will do it. <sup>8</sup>The way my Father is honored is by your {The way you honor my Father is by} doing much that pleases him [MET], and by doing that, you will show that you are my disciples.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>I have loved you just as my Father has loved me. Now keep living in a way that is appropriate for those whom I love. <sup>10</sup>If you obey what I have commanded you, you will be acting in a way that is appropriate for those whom I love, just like I have obeyed what my Father has commanded me and I act in a way that is appropriate for someone whom he loves. <sup>11</sup>I have told you these things so that you may be joyful as I am joyful, and that you may be completely joyful. <sup>12</sup>What I am commanding you is this: Love each other just like I have loved you. <sup>13</sup>The best way that people can show that they love someone is to die for that person. There is no way that you can love someone in a greater way than that. <sup>14</sup>You show that you are my friends if you keep doing what I have commanded you. <sup>15</sup>I will no longer call you my servants, because servants do not know why their masters want them to do things. Instead, I have said that you are my friends, because I, acting like a friend, have revealed to you everything that my Father told me. <sup>16</sup>You did not decide to become my disciples. Instead, I chose you, so that you would do many things that please him [MET]. The results of what you do will last forever. I also chose you so that my Father will do for you whatever you, using my authority, ask him to do [MTY]. <sup>17</sup>I repeat what I have commanded you: Love each other.”</p><p>Jesus taught them that those who were opposed to God would hate them, too.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>“The people who are opposed to God will hate you. When that happens, remember that they hated me first. <sup>19</sup>If you belonged to those who are opposed to God [MTY], they would love you like they love those who belong to them. But you do not belong to those who are opposed to God [MTY]. Instead, I chose you so that you would separate yourselves from [MTY] them. That is why those who are opposed to God [MTY] hate you. <sup>20</sup>Remember these words that I told you: ‘No servant is greater than his master.’ That means that you, who are like my servants, cannot expect people to treat you better than they treat me. So, since they have ◄persecuted me/caused me to suffer►, they will ◄persecute you/cause you to suffer► also. If they had paid attention to the things I taught them, they would pay attention to what you teach them. <sup>21</sup>They will treat you like that because you belong to me [MTY], and because they do not know the one who sent me. <sup>22</sup>If I had not come and spoken God’s message to them, they would not be guilty of rejecting me and my message. But now I have come and told them God’s message, so they will have no excuse when God judges them for their sin. <sup>23</sup>All those who hate me, it is as though they hate my Father as well. <sup>24</sup>If I had not done among them the miracles that no one else ever did, they would not be guilty of the sin of rejecting me. But now, although they have seen those miracles, they have hated both me and my Father. <sup>25</sup>But this has happened in order that these words that have been written in their Scriptures might be fulfilled {to fulfill this that ◄someone/the Psalmist► wrote in their Scriptures}: ‘They hated me for no reason.’</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    Later I will send to you from my Father the one who will ◄encourage/be like a legal counsel for► you. He is the Spirit who will teach you God’s truth. He will come from my Father. He will tell people about me. <sup>27</sup>But you disciples must also tell people about me, because you have been with me from the time when I started my ministry [MTY].”</p><a href="#JOHN-c-16"><h3 id="JOHN-c-16">16</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Jesus continued by saying to us, “I have told you these things in order that you will not stop trusting in me when people ◄cause you to suffer/persecute you►. <sup>2</sup>They will not allow you to worship in ◄synagogues/their meeting places►. In fact, there will be a time when anyone who kills you will think that he is serving God by doing that. <sup>3</sup>They will do such things because they have never known who I really am, nor who my Father is. <sup>4</sup>I have told you these things in order that when they start ◄to cause you to suffer/to persecute you► [MTY], you will remember that I warned you. I did not tell you these things when you first started to accompany me [MTY] because I was with you, and they were causing trouble for me, not for you.”</p><p>Jesus told them some things that the Holy Spirit would do.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>“Now I am about to return to the one who sent me. But I am disappointed that none of you is asking me, ‘Where are you going?’ <sup>6</sup>Instead, because I have told you these things, you are very sad. <sup>7</sup>But the truth is that it is good for you that I am going away, because if I do not go away, the Holy Spirit, who will ◄encourage/be like a legal counsel for► you will not come to you. But when I go, I will send him to you. <sup>8</sup>When he comes, he will prove that those who do not belong to God [MTY] are wrong about what is sinful and about who is really righteous and about whom God will judge and condemn for their sin. <sup>9</sup>He will tell people that their greatest sin is that they do not believe in me. <sup>10</sup>He will tell people that because I am going back to my Father, and you will no longer see me, you will know that I am the one who was truly righteous. <sup>11</sup>He will tell people that the fact that God has already determined that he will punish Satan, the one who rules this world, shows that some day God will also punish those who do not belong to him.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>I have many more things that I would like to tell you, but you are not able to accept them now. <sup>13</sup>But God’s Spirit is the one who will teach you God’s truth. When he comes, he will guide you so that you understand all spiritual truth. He will not speak from his own authority. Instead, it is the things that he hears my Father say that he will tell you. He will also tell you about things that will happen later. <sup>14</sup>He will honor me by revealing my truth to you. <sup>15</sup>Everything that my Father has is mine. That is why I said that the Spirit is able to reveal my truth to you.”</p><p>Jesus told them that after he left they would be sad, but that they would later be joyful when they saw him again.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>“After a short time I will leave you, and you will not see me. Then a short time after that you will see me again.” <sup>17</sup>So some of us said to each other, “What does he mean by saying ‘After a short time you will not see me,’ and ‘A short time after that you will see me again’? And what does he mean by ‘Because I am going back to my Father’?” <sup>18</sup>We kept asking each other, “What does he mean by saying ‘After a little while’? We do not understand what he is saying.”</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Jesus realized that we wanted to ask him about that. So he said to us, “You are asking [RHQ] each other what I meant when I said, ‘After a short time you will not see me, and then a short time after that you will see me again.’ <sup>20</sup>Listen to this carefully: After I ◄leave you/die►, those who oppose God [MTY] will be happy, but you will be sad. But later you will stop being sad and you will become joyful. <sup>21</sup>A woman who is about to bear a child feels pain, because that is what happens [MTY] at that time. But after her baby is born, she forgets that pain, because she is very joyful that her child has been born. <sup>22</sup>It will be the same with you. I will soon die and you will be sad. But after that, I will see you again. Then you will be joyful, and no one will be able to stop you from being joyful. <sup>23</sup>When that happens, you will not ask me any questions about anything. Listen to this carefully: After that happens, my Father will do for you anything you ask, because of his relationship with me [MTY]. <sup>24</sup>Up to the present time, using my authority you have not asked God to do anything for you [MTY]. Now keep asking him for things that you need. If you do that, you will receive them, and then you will be completely joyful.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>Although I have been speaking these things using figurative language, there will soon be a time when I will no longer use that kind of language. Instead, I will tell you plainly ◄about my Father/what my Father wants►. <sup>26</sup>At that time, you will ask him for things ◄because you belong to me/with my authority► [MTY]. I will not need to ask my Father to do what you ask. <sup>27</sup>My Father himself loves you because you have loved me and because you have believed that I came from God my Father, so he wants you to ask him (OR, so he does not need anyone to persuade him to help you) <sup>28</sup>I came from my Father into this world. Very soon I will be leaving this world and going back to my Father.”</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>Then we, his disciples, said, “Now you are speaking plainly, without using figurative language. <sup>30</sup>Now we understand that you know everything. You do not need anyone to ask you questions about anything, because you know what we want to ask before we ask you. That also leads us to believe that you came from God.”</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>Jesus replied, “Now you [RHQ] say that you believe that I came from God. <sup>32</sup>But listen! There will soon be a time, and that time is already here, when you will all run away! Each of you will run away to your own home. You will leave me, and I will be alone. But I will not really be alone at that time, because my Father is always with me. <sup>33</sup>I have told you these things in order that you may have inner peace because of your relationship with me. In this world you will have trouble. But be courageous! I have defeated those who are opposed to me [MTY], and you can defeat them, too!”</p><a href="#JOHN-c-17"><h3 id="JOHN-c-17">17</h3></a>
<p>Jesus prayed that God would honor him.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>After Jesus said those things, he looked up toward heaven. Then he prayed, “My Father, it is now the time [MTY] for me to suffer and die. Honor me as I do that, in order that I may honor you. <sup>2</sup>You gave me authority over all people, in order that I might enable all those whom you chose to come to me to live eternally. <sup>3</sup>The way for people to live eternally is for them to know that you are the only true God, and to know that I, Jesus, am the Messiah, the one you have sent. <sup>4</sup>I have honored you here on this earth by completing all the work that you gave me to do. <sup>5</sup>My Father, now honor me when I am with you again, by causing me to have the greatness I had when I was with you before the world began.”</p><p>Jesus prayed that God would protect his disciples.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>“I have revealed what you are like to the people whom you brought to me from among those who do not belong to you [MTY]. Those who came to me belonged to you, and you brought them to me. Now they have obeyed your message. <sup>7</sup>Now they know that everything you have given me, your message and your work, comes from you. <sup>8</sup>I gave them the message that you gave me, and they have accepted it. They now know for certain that I came from you. They now believe that you sent me. <sup>9</sup>I am praying for them. I am not praying for those who do not belong to you [MTY]. Instead, I am praying for those whom you have brought to me, because they belong to you. <sup>10</sup>All the disciples that I have belong to you, and all those who belong to you also belong to me. They have shown how great I am. <sup>11</sup>I will not be staying in the world any longer. I will be coming back to you. They, however, will be here in the world among those who are opposed to you. My Holy Father, protect them from spiritual harm by your power [MTY], the power that you gave me, in order that they may be united as we are united. <sup>12</sup>While I have been with them, I have completely protected them by the power [MTY] that you gave me. As a result, only one of them will be eternally separated from you. He is the one who was doomed to be eternally separated from you. That has happened to fulfill what a prophet wrote in the Scriptures would happen.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    Father, now I am about to return to you. I have said these things while I am still here in the world in order that my disciples may fully experience being joyful, as I have been joyful. <sup>14</sup>I have given them your message. As a result, those who are opposed to you [MTY] have hated them, because my disciples do not belong to those who oppose you [MTY], just like I do not belong to those who oppose you [MTY]. <sup>15</sup>I am asking you, not that you take them out of this world, but instead that you protect them from Satan, the evil one. <sup>16</sup>They do not belong to those who are opposed to you [MTY], just like I also do not belong to them. <sup>17</sup>Set my disciples apart so that they may ◄completely belong to/serve► you, by enabling them to live in accordance with what is true. Your message is true. <sup>18</sup>Just like you sent me here into this world, now I surely will be sending them to other places in [MTY] the world. <sup>19</sup>I dedicate myself to completely belong to you, in order that they also may truly be dedicated {dedicate themselves} completely to you.”</p><p>Jesus prayed for future believers.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>“I am praying not only for these eleven disciples. I am praying also for those who will believe in me as a result of hearing their message. <sup>21</sup>My Father, I want all of them to be united, just like I am united with you because of my relationship with you, and as you are united with me because of your relationship with me. I also want them to be united with us. I want that to happen so that those who do not know you [MTY] may know that you sent me. <sup>22</sup>I have honored my disciples just like you honored me, in order that they may be united, as we are united. <sup>23</sup>I want them to be united just like they are united with me and as you are united with me. May they be completely united, in order that those who do not belong to you [MTY] may know that you sent me and that you have loved them just like you have loved me.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    My Father, I want the disciples you have brought to me to some day be with me in heaven, where I will be. I want them to see my greatness. I want them to see the greatness you gave me because you loved me. You gave me that greatness before you created the world.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    My righteous Father, although the people who do not belong to you [MTY] do not know what you are like, I know what you are like, and my disciples know that you sent me. <sup>26</sup>I have revealed to them what you are like, and I will continue to reveal to them what you are like. I will do that in order that they may love others just like you love me, and in order that I may be in them by my Spirit.”</p><a href="#JOHN-c-18"><h3 id="JOHN-c-18">18</h3></a>
<p>They seized Jesus in a grove of olive trees.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>After Jesus finished praying, he went across the Kidron Brook, along with us disciples, to a grove of olive trees.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Judas, who was about to enable Jesus’ enemies to seize him, knew that he would probably be there. He knew that because Jesus often gathered there with us. <sup>3</sup>So Judas came to that grove. He was leading a troop of Roman soldiers and some Temple guards who had been sent by the Pharisees and chief priests. They were carrying torches and lamps and weapons. <sup>4</sup>Jesus knew everything that was about to happen to him. So as they approached, he stepped forward and asked them, “Who are you looking for?” <sup>5</sup>They replied to him, “Jesus, the man from Nazareth.” He replied, “That is who I am.” Judas, the one who was enabling his enemies to seize him, was with them. <sup>6</sup>When Jesus told them, “That is who I am,” they lurched backward and fell down on the ground because of his power. <sup>7</sup>He asked them again, “Who are you looking for?” They said, “Jesus, the man from Nazareth.” <sup>8</sup>Jesus replied, “I told you that I am Jesus. So since I am the one you are looking for, allow these disciples of mine to go.” <sup>9</sup>This happened in order that when they did what he asked them to do, the words would be fulfilled that he had prayed, “I will never lose any of those whom God has brought to me.”</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Simon Peter had a long dagger. So he drew it and tried to kill the high priest’s servant, but he only cut off the man’s right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus. <sup>11</sup>Jesus said to Peter, “Put your sword back into its sheath! ◄I must endure what my Father wants me to suffer./Do you not think that I must endure what my Father wants me to suffer?► [MET, RHQ]”</p><p>They took Jesus to be questioned by Annas, the former high priest.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Then the troop of soldiers, along with their commander and the Jewish Temple guards, seized Jesus. They tied his hands behind his back. <sup>13</sup>Then they took him first to Annas, who was previously the high priest. He was the father-in-law of Caiaphas. Caiaphas was the high priest that year. <sup>14</sup>Caiaphas was the one who previously advised the Jewish Council that it would be better if one man died for the sake of the people than for all the people of the Jewish nation to die.</p><p>Peter denied that he was Jesus’ disciple.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>Simon Peter and I were following Jesus. Because the high priest knew me, his doorkeeper permitted me to enter the courtyard. <sup>16</sup>But Peter had to wait outside near the doorway. However, since I knew the high priest, I went back to the doorway and spoke to the girl who was guarding the entrance. Then she allowed Peter to come in. <sup>17</sup>The servant girl who was guarding the doorway said to Peter, “Surely you are not another disciple of that man they have arrested, are you?” He said, “I am not.” <sup>18</sup>It was cold, so the high priest’s slaves and Temple guards made a charcoal fire and were standing around it to keep warm. Peter was also standing near it, warming himself.</p><p>The High Priest questioned Jesus.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    While Peter was doing that, the high priest asked Jesus about his disciples and about what he was teaching people. <sup>20</sup>Jesus replied, “I have always spoken where many people [MTY, HYP] could hear me. I have taught them in ◄the synagogues/their meeting places► and in the Temple courtyard, in places where many [HYP] Jews come together. I have spoken nothing secretly. <sup>21</sup>So ◄why are you asking me questions like this illegally?/you should not be asking me questions like this illegally!► [RHQ] Ask the people who heard what I taught! They certainly know what I said!” <sup>22</sup>After Jesus said that, one of the Temple guards standing near him slapped him on his face. He said, “◄That is not the way you should answer the high priest!/Is that the way you should answer the high priest?► [RHQ]” <sup>23</sup>Jesus replied to him, “If I said something that was contrary to your laws, you could tell me that what I said that was wrong. But because I said only what was right, ◄you should not be striking me!/why are you striking me?► [RHQ]” <sup>24</sup>Then after Jesus’ hands were tied {after they tied Jesus hands} again, Annas sent him to Caiaphas, the high priest.</p><p>Peter denied two more times that he knew Jesus.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>As Simon Peter was standing warming himself at the fire, someone else said to him, “You are not one of that man’s disciples, are you?” He denied that he was, and said, “I am not.” <sup>26</sup>Later one of the high priest’s servants, a man who was a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off before, said to him, “I saw you with that man in the grove of olive trees, did I not?” <sup>27</sup>Peter again denied it. Immediately a rooster crowed, as Jesus had said would happen.</p><p>Pilate the governor questioned Jesus.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>Then the Jewish leaders [SYN] led Jesus from the home of Caiaphas to the headquarters of Pilate, the Roman governor. It was before dawn. Pilate was a non-Jew, and they thought that if they entered his headquarters, they would become unacceptable to God {God would reject them}, and as a result they would not be able to eat the food during the Passover celebration. Because of that, they did not want to enter Pilate’s headquarters. <sup>29</sup>So Pilate came out to talk to them. He said, “What law do you say that this man has disobeyed?” <sup>30</sup>They knew that Jesus had not disobeyed any Roman law, so they did not want to answer him. Instead, they said, “If this man were not a criminal, we would not have brought him to you!” <sup>31</sup>Then Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your own laws!” Then the Jewish leaders [SYN] said, “No! We want him executed, but we want you Romans to execute him, because we Jews have no right to execute anyone!” <sup>32</sup>The Romans executed people by nailing them to a cross. So, as a result of what the Jewish leaders said, it was fulfilled {the Romans would fulfill} what Jesus had said previously about the way he was going to die.</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>Pilate then went back inside his headquarters. He summoned Jesus. Because the Jewish leaders had said that Jesus claimed to be a king, Pilate said to Jesus scornfully, “Are you the king of the Jews?” <sup>34</sup>Jesus replied, “Are you asking that because you yourself want to know if I claim to be a king, or because ◄someone else/Caiaphas► said that I claim to be their king?” <sup>35</sup>Pilate replied, “I am not a Jew, so ◄I cannot understand these matters!/how can I understand these matters?► [RHQ] It was your fellow Jews and your chief priests who brought you to me! What have you done to make them want to execute you?” <sup>36</sup>Jesus replied, “It is not people in [MTY] this world who are making me king. If it was people in this world who were making me a king, my disciples would have fought in order that the Jewish leaders [SYN] would be prevented {to prevent the Jewish leaders [SYN]} from seizing me. But it is not someone here in this world who is making me a king.” <sup>37</sup>Then Pilate said to him, “So are you saying that you are a king?” Jesus replied, “Yes, what you have said about my being a king is correct. I was born to become a king, and I came into this world to tell people the truth about God. Everyone who believes the truth pays attention to what I say.” <sup>38</sup>Pilate said to him, “How can anyone know what the truth is?”</p><p>After he said that, he went outside and talked to the Jewish leaders [SYN] again. He said to them, “I do not find that he has done anything at all for which I should punish him. <sup>39</sup>But you Jews customarily, every year during the Passover celebration, ask me to release for you someone who is in prison. So would you like for me to release for you the man who you Jews say is your king?” <sup>40</sup>They shouted again, “No, do not release this man! Instead, release Barrabas!” But Barrabas was in prison because he was a revolutionist!</p><a href="#JOHN-c-19"><h3 id="JOHN-c-19">19</h3></a>
<p>Pilate finally permitted them to crucify Jesus.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Then Pilate took Jesus inside and had soldiers ◄scourge Jesus/strike Jesus with a whip that had pieces of metal or bone fastened to it►. <sup>2</sup>The soldiers also took some branches with thorns and wove them to make something like a crown. Then they put it on his head. They also put a purple robe on him. They did these things to ridicule him by pretending that he was a king. <sup>3</sup>Then they kept coming to him and saying, “Hooray for the King of the Jews [IRO]!” and slapping him on his face.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Once more Pilate came outside and said to the crowd, “Look! I am bringing him out to you so that you may know that I do not find that he has done anything for which we should punish him any more.” <sup>5</sup>When Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, “Look at this wretched man!” <sup>6</sup>When the chief priests and Temple guards saw him, they shouted, “Command your soldiers to kill him by nailing him to a cross! Crucify him!” Pilate, knowing that they could not legally do it themselves, said to them, “You yourselves take him and nail him to a cross! As for me, I do not find that he has done anything for which we should punish him.” <sup>7</sup>The Jewish leaders [SYN] replied, “Our ancestor Moses gave us the law that says we must kill anyone who claims to be God. This man claims that he is ◄the Son of/the man who is also► God, so you must have him killed {command your soldiers to kill him}.” <sup>8</sup>When Pilate heard that, he was more afraid of what would happen to himself if he commanded the soldiers to kill Jesus. <sup>9</sup>So he took Jesus back inside the headquarters. He said to Jesus, “Where do you really come from?” But Jesus did not answer him. <sup>10</sup>So Pilate said to him, “Are you refusing to answer me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you, and I also have authority to have you crucified {command my soldiers to crucify you}?” <sup>11</sup>Jesus replied, “The only authority you have is what has been given to you by God [MTY] {what God [MTY] has given you}. The high priest put me into your hands. He has done to me what he wanted to do, and you do not really want to do it. So he is guilty of committing a greater sin than you are.”</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Because of that, Pilate kept trying to release Jesus. But the Jewish leaders [SYN], threatening to report to the Emperor that Pilate was not going to punish a man who claimed he was a king, continued to shout, “Anyone who claims that he is a king is opposing the Emperor! So if you release this man, we will make sure that the Emperor learns about it, and then he will not consider you as his friend!” <sup>13</sup>When Pilate heard that, he brought Jesus out again. He sat down at the place where he made decisions about punishing people. The place was called {People called it} The Stone Pavement. In the Aramaic language its name was Gabbatha. <sup>14</sup>It was almost noontime, on the day that they prepared things for the Passover celebration (OR, the day before the Sabbath during the Passover celebration).</p><p>Pilate said to the Jewish leaders [SYN], ridiculing them, “Look at your king!” <sup>15</sup>They shouted, “Take him away! Take him away! Have him crucified {Command your soldiers to nail him to a cross}!” Pilate said to them, “He is your king! Do you really want me to tell my soldiers to nail him to a cross?” The chief priests replied, “The Emperor is our king! We do not have any other king!” <sup>16</sup>Then at last Pilate agreed to do what they wanted, and he told the soldiers to crucify Jesus.</p><p>They nailed Jesus to a cross.</p><p>
    </p><p>Then the soldiers took Jesus away. <sup>17</sup>As they left, he himself was carrying the cross on which they were going to nail him. They went to a place called The Place of a Skull. In the Aramaic language it is called {they call it} Golgotha. <sup>18</sup>There, after removing most of his clothes, the soldiers nailed him to the cross. They also nailed two other criminals to crosses. There was one on each side, and Jesus was in the middle.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Pilate also had them write on a board a notice that stated why they were executing him, and fasten it to the cross. But all they wrote was ‘Jesus from Nazareth, the King of the Jews’. <sup>20</sup>Many Jews were able to read this sign, because the place where Jesus was nailed {where they nailed Jesus} to the cross was very close to Jerusalem, where many people had come for the celebration, and because it was written {they wrote it} in three languages: Hebrew, Latin, and Greek. <sup>21</sup>So the Jewish priests went back to Pilate and protested, saying to him, “Change what they have written from ‘The King of the Jews’ to ‘This man said that he is the King of the Jews’!” <sup>22</sup>Pilate replied, “What I told them to write is what they have written, and I will not change it.”</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>After the soldiers nailed Jesus to the cross, they took his clothes and divided them into four parts, one part for each soldier. But they kept his cloak separate. This cloak was without seam, woven from top to bottom, one piece of cloth. <sup>24</sup>So they said to each other, “Let’s not tear it. Instead, let’s decide ◄by throwing lots/by gambling► who will get it.” So that is what the soldiers did. As a result, these words were fulfilled {they fulfilled these words} that the Psalmist had written in Scripture,</p><p>They divided most of my clothes among themselves.</p><p>They cast lots for one piece of my clothing.</p><p>Jesus entrusted his mother to John’s care.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>Near the cross where they had nailed Jesus stood his mother, his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and another Mary, the woman from Magdala village. <sup>26</sup>Jesus saw his mother standing there. He also saw me standing nearby. Then he said to his mother, “This man will now be like your son.” <sup>27</sup>And he said to me, “Treat this woman as [MET] your mother.” So from that time I took her to my home and took care of her.</p><p>Jesus died.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>Later, Jesus knew that everything that God sent him to do had now been completed {that he had now completed everything that God sent him to do}, but he knew that something else that was written in the Scriptures had to be fulfilled {that he had to fulfill something else that they had written in the Scriptures}. So he said, “I am thirsty!” <sup>29</sup>There was a jar of sour wine there. So someone took a stalk of a plant called hyssop and fastened a sponge to it. Then he dipped the sponge into the wine and lifted it up to Jesus’ lips. <sup>30</sup>When Jesus tasted the sour wine, he shouted, “I have finished all that I came to do!” Then he bowed his head and ◄died/handed over his spirit to God►.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>That was the day that they prepared everything for their ◄Sabbath/day of rest►. The next day was a special day of rest, because it was the day of rest during the Passover celebration. The Jewish leaders [SYN] did not want the bodies of the three men to remain on the cross during their ◄Sabbath/day of rest► because leaving bodies hanging overnight would be contrary to their Jewish laws. So they went to Pilate and asked him to command that the legs of the three men on the crosses be broken {the soldiers to break the legs of the three men on the crosses}, so that they would die quickly. Then their bodies could be taken down and buried {someone could take down their bodies and bury them}. <sup>32</sup>So, after Pilate agreed, the soldiers went and broke the legs of the first man whom they had nailed on a cross near Jesus. Then they broke the legs of the second man. <sup>33</sup>But when they came to Jesus, they saw that he was dead already. So they did not break his legs. <sup>34</sup>Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus’ side with a spear to make sure that Jesus was dead. Immediately blood clots and other liquid flowed out, which showed that Jesus was really dead. <sup>35</sup>I, John, saw this myself, and what I am writing is true. I know that I am telling the truth, and I am saying this in order that you may believe in (OR, my testimony about) Jesus. <sup>36</sup>These things happened in order that these words would be fulfilled {to fulfill these words} that are written in Scripture: “Not one of his bones will be broken {No one will break any of his bones}.”</p><p>
    <sup>37</sup>And they fulfilled another Scripture passage that has these words: ‘They will look on the one whom they have pierced’.</p><p>Joseph and others put Jesus’ body in a cave.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>38</sup>Later, Joseph, from Arimathea town, went to Pilate and asked Pilate to allow him to take Jesus’ body down from the cross. Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but he did not tell anyone that, because he was afraid of the other Jewish leaders [SYN]. Pilate permitted him to take Jesus’ body, so he went, along with others, and they took Jesus’ body down from the cross. <sup>39</sup>Nicodemus was one of them. He was the man who previously went to visit Jesus at night. Nicodemus bought an expensive mixture of myrrh and aloe spices to put on the body. It weighed about ◄75 pounds/35 kilograms►. <sup>40</sup>They took the body of Jesus and wrapped strips of linen cloth around it, putting the spices in with the strips of cloth. They did this according to the Jewish customs about burying bodies in tombs. <sup>41</sup>Close to the place where Jesus was crucified {where they nailed Jesus to the cross} there was a grove of trees, and at the edge of that grove was a new burial cave. Nobody had ever been put in that cave previously. <sup>42</sup>The Jewish day of rest would start at sunset, and they had to finish burying his body before then. So, since that cave was nearby, they laid Jesus’ body there and rolled a huge stone in front of the entrance.</p><a href="#JOHN-c-20"><h3 id="JOHN-c-20">20</h3></a>
<p>On Sunday morning they discovered that Jesus’ tomb was empty.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Early on Sunday morning, while it was still dark, Mary, the woman from Magdala village, went to the burial cave with some other women. They saw that the stone had been removed {that someone had removed the stone} from the entrance to the cave. <sup>2</sup>So Mary ran to where Simon Peter and I were staying in Jerusalem. She said to us, “They have taken the Lord’s body out of the burial cave, and we do not know where they have put it!” <sup>3</sup>So Peter and I started going to the cave. <sup>4</sup>We were both running, but I ran faster than Peter and got there first. <sup>5</sup>I stooped down at the entrance and looked inside. I saw the strips of linen cloth lying there where his body had been laid, but I did not go inside. <sup>6</sup>Then Simon Peter, who was running behind me, arrived. He went inside the cave. He, too, saw the strips of linen cloth lying there. <sup>7</sup>He also saw the cloth that they had wrapped around Jesus’ head. It had been folded and put {Someone had folded it and put it} aside, separate from the linen strips. <sup>8</sup>Then I also went inside. I saw those things and I believed that Jesus had truly become alive again. <sup>9</sup>Before this happened, we did not understand from what the prophets had written in the Scriptures, that he had to become alive again after he died.</p><p>Jesus appeared to Mary from Magdala.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Then we two disciples went back to where we were staying. In the meantime, Mary returned to the cave. <sup>11</sup>As she stood outside the cave crying, she stooped down to look inside the cave. <sup>12</sup>She saw two angels in very white clothing, sitting at the place where Jesus’ body had been laid. One was where his head had been, and the other was where his feet had been. <sup>13</sup>They said to her, “Woman, why are you crying?” She said to them, “They have taken away the body of my Lord, and I do not know where they have put it!” <sup>14</sup>After she said that, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus. <sup>15</sup>He said to her, “Woman, why are you crying? Who are you looking for?” Thinking that he was the gardener, she said to him, “Sir, if you have taken his body away, tell me where you have put it. Then I will get it and bury it properly.” <sup>16</sup>Jesus said to her, “Mary!” She turned toward him again and recognized him. Then she exclaimed in Aramaic, “Rabboni!” which means ‘Teacher’. <sup>17</sup>Jesus said to her, “Stop clinging to me, because I have not yet returned to my Father. Go to my disciples and tell them, ‘I am about to return to my Father and your Father, to the one who is my God and your God’.” <sup>18</sup>So Mary went to where we disciples were and told us that she had seen the Lord alive again. She also told us what Jesus said that she should tell us.</p><p>Jesus appeared to many of his disciples.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>On that Sunday evening we disciples gathered together. The doors were locked {We locked the doors} because we were afraid that the Jewish leaders [SYN] might arrest us. Suddenly Jesus appeared miraculously and stood among us! He said to us, “May God give you inner peace!” <sup>20</sup>After he said that, he showed us the wounds in his hands and his side. We were very happy when we saw the Lord! <sup>21</sup>Jesus said to us again, “May God give you peace! Just like my Father sent me, now I am sending you to proclaim my message.” <sup>22</sup>After saying that, he breathed on us and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit! <sup>23</sup>If you forgive people for their having sinned, God will already have forgiven them. If you do not forgive them, God has not forgiven them.”</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>One of us disciples, Thomas, the one whom we called The Twin, was not with us when Jesus appeared to us. <sup>25</sup>When the rest of us told him that we had seen the Lord, he said to us, “If I do not see the marks of the nails in his hands and put my fingers in the place where the nails were, and put my hands into the place in his side where the soldier thrust the spear, I will certainly not believe that he was the one you saw!”</p><p>Jesus appeared to all of his disciples, including Thomas.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>A week later we were in the house again. This time Thomas was with us. Although the doors had been locked {we had locked the doors}, Jesus again appeared miraculously and stood among us. He said, “May God give peace to you!” <sup>27</sup>Then he showed Thomas his hands and said to him, “Put your finger here! Look at the wounds in my hands! Reach out your hand and put it in the wound in my side! Stop doubting [LIT/DOU]! Instead, believe that I am alive again!” <sup>28</sup>Thomas answered him, “You are truly my Lord and my God!” <sup>29</sup>Jesus said to him, “Because you have seen me, you have believed that about me. But God is truly pleased with those who have believed that about me, even though they have not seen me!”</p><p>John stated the purpose of this book.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>
    We disciples saw Jesus perform many other miracles, but I have not written about them in this book. <sup>31</sup>But these that I have written about, I have written about them in order that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, ◄the Son of God/the man who is also God►, and in order that you may have eternal life by trusting ◄in him/in what he has done for you► [MTY].</p><a href="#JOHN-c-21"><h3 id="JOHN-c-21">21</h3></a>
<p>Jesus appeared to seven disciples and enabled them miraculously to catch a lot of fish.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>After that, Jesus showed himself to us disciples when we were at Tiberias Lake, which is another name for Galilee Lake. This is what happened: <sup>2</sup>Simon Peter, Thomas who was called {whom we called} The Twin, Nathaniel from Cana town in Galilee, my older brother and I, and two other disciples were together. <sup>3</sup>Simon Peter said to us, “I am going to try to catch some fish.” We said, “We will go with you.” So we went down to the lake and got into the boat. But that night we caught nothing. <sup>4</sup>Early the next morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but we did not know that it was Jesus. <sup>5</sup>He called out to us, “My friends, you have not caught any fish, have you?” We answered, “You are correct, we have not caught any.” <sup>6</sup>He said to us, “Throw your net out from the right-hand side of the boat! Then you will find some!” We did that, and we caught so many fish in the net that we were unable to pull the net into the boat! <sup>7</sup>But I knew that it was Jesus, so I said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” Peter had taken off his cloak while he was working, but as soon as he heard me say “It is the Lord!” he wrapped his cloak around himself and jumped into the water and swam to shore. <sup>8</sup>The rest of us came to the shore in the boat, pulling the net full of fish. We were not far from shore, only about 100 yards/meters. <sup>9</sup>When we got to the shore, we saw that there was a fire of burning coals there, with a large fish on the fire, and some buns. <sup>10</sup>Jesus said to us, “Bring some of the fish that you have just caught!” <sup>11</sup>Simon Peter got in the boat and dragged the net to the shore. It was full of large fish. There were 153 of them! But in spite of there being so many fish, the net was not torn. <sup>12</sup>Jesus said to us, “Come and eat some breakfast!” None of us dared to ask him, “Who are you?” because we knew that it was the Lord. <sup>13</sup>Jesus took the buns and gave them to us. He did the same with the fish. <sup>14</sup>That was the third time that Jesus appeared to us disciples after God caused him to become alive again after he died.</p><p>Jesus asked Peter three times if he really loved Jesus. Then Jesus told Peter how Peter would die.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>When we had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “John’s son Simon, do you love me more than these other disciples do?” Peter said to him, “Yes, Lord, you know that you are dear to me (OR, that I love you).” Jesus said, “Give to those who belong to me what they need spiritually, like [MET] a shepherd provides food for his lambs.” <sup>16</sup>Jesus said to him again, “John’s son Simon, do you love me?” He replied, “Yes, Lord, you know that you are dear to me (OR, that I love you).” Jesus said to him, “Take care of those who belong to me, like [MET] a shepherd takes care of his sheep.” <sup>17</sup>Jesus said to him a third time, “John’s son Simon, am I really dear to you (OR, do you really love me)?” Peter was grieved because Jesus asked him this three times, and because the third time he changed the question. He said, “Lord, you know everything. You know that you are dear to me (OR, that I love you).” Jesus said, “Give to those who belong to me what they need spiritually, as [MET] a shepherd provides food for his sheep. <sup>18</sup>Now listen to this carefully: When you were young, you put your clothes on by yourself, and you went wherever you wanted to go. But when you are old, you will stretch out your arms, and someone will fasten them with a rope and will lead you to a place where you do not want to go.” <sup>19</sup>Jesus said this to indicate how Peter would die ◄violently/on a cross► in order to honor God. Then Jesus said to him, “Keep being my faithful disciple until you die.”</p><p>Peter asked Jesus what would happen to John.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>Peter turned around and saw that I was following them. I was the one who leaned close to Jesus during the Passover meal and said, “Lord, who is going to enable your enemies to seize you?” <sup>21</sup>When Peter saw me, he asked, “Lord, what is going to happen to him?” <sup>22</sup>Jesus said to him, “If I want him to remain alive until I return, ◄that is not your concern!/what is that to you?► [RHQ] You be my faithful disciple!” <sup>23</sup>Some of the other believers heard a report of what Jesus had said about me, and they thought that Jesus meant that I would not die. But Jesus did not say that I would not die. He said only, “If I want him to remain alive until I return, ◄that is not your concern!/what is that to you?► [RHQ]”</p><p>A statement about the truth and accuracy of this document.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    I, John, am the disciple who has seen all these things and I have written them down.</p><p>My fellow apostles and I know that what I have written is true.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>Jesus did many other things. If they would all be written {If people would write them all} down in detail, I suppose that the whole world would not have enough space [HYP] to contain the books that would be written {that they would write} about what he did.</p><a href="#JOHN-h">^</a> <a href="#JOHN-c-1">[1]</a> <a href="#JOHN-c-2">[2]</a> <a href="#JOHN-c-3">[3]</a> <a href="#JOHN-c-4">[4]</a> <a href="#JOHN-c-5">[5]</a> <a href="#JOHN-c-6">[6]</a> <a href="#JOHN-c-7">[7]</a> <a href="#JOHN-c-8">[8]</a> <a href="#JOHN-c-9">[9]</a> <a href="#JOHN-c-10">[10]</a> <a href="#JOHN-c-11">[11]</a> <a href="#JOHN-c-12">[12]</a> <a href="#JOHN-c-13">[13]</a> <a href="#JOHN-c-14">[14]</a> <a href="#JOHN-c-15">[15]</a> <a href="#JOHN-c-16">[16]</a> <a href="#JOHN-c-17">[17]</a> <a href="#JOHN-c-18">[18]</a> <a href="#JOHN-c-19">[19]</a> <a href="#JOHN-c-20">[20]</a> <a href="#JOHN-c-21">[21]</a>
