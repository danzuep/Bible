Therefore, this is what he says: ‘I will again be merciful to <span id="add-ZEC.1.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the people of</span> Jerusalem, and they will rebuild my temple.

The Commander of the armies of angels <span id="add-ZEC.1.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">also</span> said this: ‘Tell the people that <span id="add-ZEC.1.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the people in</span> my towns <span id="add-ZEC.1.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in Judah</span> will soon be very prosperous again, and I will encourage <span id="add-ZEC.1.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the people of</span> Jerusalem, and their city will again be my chosen <span id="add-ZEC.1.17" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">city</span>.’”</p>

If the people of Egypt <span id="add-ZEC.14.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">or any other nation</span> do not go to Jerusalem, <span id="add-ZEC.14.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">they will not have any rain</span>. And Yahweh will cause them to experience the same plague that afflicted the <span id="add-ZEC.14.18" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">people of other</span> nations that did not celebrate the Festival of Living in Temporary Shelters. <a href="#ZEC.14.19"><sup id="ZEC.14.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
That is how <span id="add-ZEC.14.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Yahweh</span> will punish <span id="add-ZEC.14.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the people of</span> Egypt and <span id="add-ZEC.14.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the people of</span> any <span id="add-ZEC.14.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">other</span> nation who do not go <span id="add-ZEC.14.19" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to Jerusalem</span> to celebrate the Festival of Living in Temporary Shelters.</p>
<p id="p-ZEC.14.19" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#ZEC.14.20"><sup id="ZEC.14.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
At that time, <span id="add-ZEC.14.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the words</span> ‘Dedicated to Yahweh’ will be written on the bells that are fastened to the horses. The <span id="add-ZEC.14.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">cooking</span> pots in <span id="add-ZEC.14.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the courtyard of the</span> temple will be <span id="add-ZEC.14.20" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">sacred</span>, like the bowls that are near the altar. <a href="#ZEC.14.21"><sup id="ZEC.14.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
Every pot in Jerusalem and <span id="add-ZEC.14.21" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in other places in</span> Judah will be dedicated to the Commander of the armies of angels. So everyone who offers sacrifices <span id="add-ZEC.14.21" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">there in Jerusalem</span> will be able to take some of the meat that has been brought for sacrifices, and cook it in their own pots. And at that time, people will no longer buy or sell things in <span id="add-ZEC.14.21" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">the courtyard of</span> the temple of the Commander of the armies of angels.</p>
