Dear friends, I want you to understand well that the Lord <span id="add-2PE.3.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">God is willing to wait a long time to judge the people in the world! How much time passes before</span> the Lord God <span id="add-2PE.3.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">judges the people in the world does not matter to him! He considers</span> that one day <span id="add-2PE.3.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">passes no more quickly than</span> 1,000 years, and <span id="add-2PE.3.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">he also considers</span> that 1,000 years <span id="add-2PE.3.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">pass as quickly as</span> one day passes <span id="add-2PE.3.8" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to us</span>! <a href="#2PE.3.9"><sup id="2PE.3.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
<span id="add-2PE.3.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Therefore, you should not think that because Christ has not yet come back to judge people</span>, the Lord God is ◄delaying/slow to do► what he promised. Some people think that this is so, <span id="add-2PE.3.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and they say that Christ will never come back</span>. But <span id="add-2PE.3.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">you should understand that the reason why Christ has not yet come back to judge people is that</span> God is being patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be lost <span id="add-2PE.3.9" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">eternally</span>. Instead, he wants everyone to turn away from their sinful behavior. <a href="#2PE.3.10"><sup id="2PE.3.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
Although <span id="add-2PE.3.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">God is being patient, at</span> the time [MTY] <span id="add-2PE.3.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that he has chosen</span>, the Lord <span id="add-2PE.3.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Jesus Christ</span> will <span id="add-2PE.3.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">certainly</span> come back <span id="add-2PE.3.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to judge people</span>. He will come back <span id="add-2PE.3.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">unexpectedly</span>, like a thief [SIM] <span id="add-2PE.3.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">comes unexpectedly</span>. At that time there will be a great roaring sound. The heavens will cease to exist. ◄The elements/The parts <span id="add-2PE.3.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">of which the universe consists</span>► will be destroyed by fire, and the earth <span id="add-2PE.3.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that God made</span> and everything on it <span id="add-2PE.3.10" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">that people have made</span> will disappear (OR, will be burned up).</p>

Therefore, dear friends, because you are waiting for these things <span id="add-2PE.3.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">to happen</span>, do all that you can <span id="add-2PE.3.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">live</span> ◄in a <span id="add-2PE.3.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">godly manner/</span>in a <span id="add-2PE.3.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">manner that pleases God</span>►, <span id="add-2PE.3.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">in order that Christ</span> will see that you <span id="add-2PE.3.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">are</span> completely pure [DOU] <span id="add-2PE.3.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">and that you are living</span> peacefully <span id="add-2PE.3.14" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">with each other</span>. <a href="#2PE.3.15"><sup id="2PE.3.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
And think about this: Our Lord <span id="add-2PE.3.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">Jesus Christ is</span> patient <span id="add-2PE.3.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">because he wants</span> people to be saved. Our dear ◄brother/fellow believer► Paul also wrote wise words to you <span id="add-2PE.3.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">about these same matters</span>, because God enabled him to understand <span id="add-2PE.3.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">these</span> ◄<span id="add-2PE.3.15" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">events/things that will happen</span>►. <a href="#2PE.3.16"><sup id="2PE.3.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
In the <span id="add-2PE.3.16" class="usx-add" link-data="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/">letters</span> that Paul wrote there are certain things that are difficult for people to understand.
