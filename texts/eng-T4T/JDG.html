After Joshua died, the Israeli people asked Yahweh, “Which <span id="add-JDG.1.1" class="usx-add">of our tribes</span> should attack the Canaan people-group first?”</p>

Yahweh replied, “I will enable the tribe of Judah to defeat [IDM] the Canaan people-group.”</p>

    <a href="#JDG.1.3"><sup id="JDG.1.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
The men of Judah went to their fellow Israelis, <span id="add-JDG.1.3" class="usx-add">the men</span> from the tribe of Simeon, and said to them, “Come and help us to fight the Canaan people-group <span id="add-JDG.1.3" class="usx-add">in order that we can take from them</span> the land <span id="add-JDG.1.3" class="usx-add">that Yahweh</span> allotted to us.

<p id="p-JDG.1.3" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.1.4"><sup id="JDG.1.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
When the men of those two tribes attacked, Yahweh enabled them to defeat 10,000 men of the Canaan people-group and the Periz people-group [DOU] at Bezek <span id="add-JDG.1.4" class="usx-add">city</span>. <a href="#JDG.1.5"><sup id="JDG.1.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
During the battle they found Adoni-Bezek, the leader of the city, <a href="#JDG.1.6"><sup id="JDG.1.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
but he <span id="add-JDG.1.6" class="usx-add">tried to</span> run away. The Israelis pursued him and caught him. Then they cut off his thumbs and his big toes.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.1.6" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.1.7"><sup id="JDG.1.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Adoni-Bezek said, “<span id="add-JDG.1.7" class="usx-add">My army captured</span> 70 kings. We cut off their thumbs and big toes. After that, <span id="add-JDG.1.7" class="usx-add">we forced</span> those kings to eat scraps that fell from our table. Now God has ◄paid me back for/done to me like► <span id="add-JDG.1.7" class="usx-add">what we did to them</span>.” Then the men of Judah took Adoni-Bezek to Jerusalem, and he died there.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.1.7" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.1.8"><sup id="JDG.1.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
The army of Judah fought against the men of Jerusalem, and they captured the city. With their swords they killed <span id="add-JDG.1.8" class="usx-add">the people who lived there</span> and they burned <span id="add-JDG.1.8" class="usx-add">the houses in</span> the city.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.1.8" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.1.9"><sup id="JDG.1.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
Later, the men of Judah went down to fight the Canaan people-group who lived in the hilly area, in the desert to the south, and in the foothills <span id="add-JDG.1.9" class="usx-add">to the west</span>. <a href="#JDG.1.10"><sup id="JDG.1.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
The men of Judah also went to fight against the Canaan people-group who lived in Hebron <span id="add-JDG.1.10" class="usx-add">city</span>, which at that time was named Kiriath-Arba. They defeated <span id="add-JDG.1.10" class="usx-add">the armies of kings</span> Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.</p>
<p id="s1-JDG.1.10" class="usx-s1" >Springs for Caleb’s daughter</p>
<p id="p-JDG.1.10" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.1.11"><sup id="JDG.1.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
Then they left that area and went to fight against the people living in Debir <span id="add-JDG.1.11" class="usx-add">city</span>, which was previously named Kiriath-Sepher. <a href="#JDG.1.12"><sup id="JDG.1.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
<span id="add-JDG.1.12" class="usx-add">Before they attacked the city</span>, Caleb said to them, “If one of you attacks and captures Kiriath-Sepher, I will allow him to marry my daughter.” <a href="#JDG.1.13"><sup id="JDG.1.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Othniel, who was the son of Caleb’s younger brother Kenaz, captured the city. So Caleb gave his daughter Acsah to him, to become his wife.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.1.13" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.1.14"><sup id="JDG.1.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
When Acsah married Othniel, she told him to ask her father to give him a field. <span id="add-JDG.1.14" class="usx-add">But she decided to ask him herself. She rode to Caleb’s house on her donkey</span>, and when she got off the donkey, Caleb <span id="add-JDG.1.14" class="usx-add">could see that something was troubling her. So he</span> asked her, “What do you want?”</p>
<p id="p-JDG.1.14" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.1.15"><sup id="JDG.1.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
She replied, “I want you to do a favor for me. You have given me some land in the southern desert, <span id="add-JDG.1.15" class="usx-add">but it is very dry there</span>. So please also give me some <span id="add-JDG.1.15" class="usx-add">land that has</span> springs of water.” So Caleb gave her some land on higher ground that had a spring, and some land on lower ground that also had a spring.</p>
<p id="s1-JDG.1.15" class="usx-s1" >More fights against the Canaanites</p>
<p id="p-JDG.1.15" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.1.16"><sup id="JDG.1.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
The people of the Ken people-group who were descendants of Moses’ father-in-law left Jericho, which was called ‘The City of Palm Trees’. They went with some of the men of Judah to live with them in the southern desert area, near Arad <span id="add-JDG.1.16" class="usx-add">city</span>.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.1.16" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.1.17"><sup id="JDG.1.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
The men of Judah and their fellow Israelis from the tribe of Simeon defeated the people of the Canaan people-group who lived in Zephath <span id="add-JDG.1.17" class="usx-add">city</span>. They completely destroyed the city and gave it a new name, Hormah, <span id="add-JDG.1.17" class="usx-add">which means ‘complete destruction’</span>. <a href="#JDG.1.18"><sup id="JDG.1.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
The men of Judah also captured Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron <span id="add-JDG.1.18" class="usx-add">cities</span> and all the land that is near those cities. <a href="#JDG.1.19"><sup id="JDG.1.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
Yahweh helped the men of Judah to capture the hilly area, but they could not force the people who were living in the plains to leave, because <span id="add-JDG.1.19" class="usx-add">those people had better weapons—</span>they had iron chariots.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.1.19" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.1.20"><sup id="JDG.1.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
Hebron <span id="add-JDG.1.20" class="usx-add">city</span> was given to Caleb because Moses had promised him that he could have that city. And Caleb forced the three clans descended from Anak to leave that area. <a href="#JDG.1.21"><sup id="JDG.1.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
But the people of the tribe of Benjamin could not force the people of the Jebus people-group to leave Jerusalem. So, since that time the people of the Jebus people-group have lived in Jerusalem with the people of the tribe of Benjamin.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.1.21" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.1.22"><sup id="JDG.1.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
The men of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh went to fight against <span id="add-JDG.1.22" class="usx-add">the men of</span> Bethel <span id="add-JDG.1.22" class="usx-add">city</span>, and Yahweh helped them. <a href="#JDG.1.23"><sup id="JDG.1.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
They sent some spies to <span id="add-JDG.1.23" class="usx-add">find out everything that they could find out about</span> Bethel, which was previously called Luz. <a href="#JDG.1.24"><sup id="JDG.1.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
The spies saw a man who was coming out of the city. They said to him, “If you show us a way to get into the city, we will be kind to you <span id="add-JDG.1.24" class="usx-add">and we will not kill you</span>.” <a href="#JDG.1.25"><sup id="JDG.1.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
So the man showed them a way to enter the city. The men of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh entered the city and killed all the people with their swords, but they did not kill the man <span id="add-JDG.1.25" class="usx-add">who showed them how to get into the city</span>, and they did not kill his family. <a href="#JDG.1.26"><sup id="JDG.1.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
That man went to the area where the descendants of Heth lived, and built a city. He named the city Luz, and that is still the name of that city.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.1.26" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.1.27"><sup id="JDG.1.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
There were people of the Canaan people-group who lived in Beth-Shan, Taanach, Dor, Ibleam, and Megiddo <span id="add-JDG.1.27" class="usx-add">cities</span> and in the surrounding villages. <span id="add-JDG.1.27" class="usx-add">The men of</span> the tribe of Manasseh did not force those people to leave those towns, because the people of the Canaan people-group were determined to stay there. <a href="#JDG.1.28"><sup id="JDG.1.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
Later, the Israelis became ◄stronger/more numerous►, and they forced the people of the Canaan people-group to work for them <span id="add-JDG.1.28" class="usx-add">as their slaves</span>, but they did not force all the people of the Canaan people-group to leave their land. <a href="#JDG.1.29"><sup id="JDG.1.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>
<span id="add-JDG.1.29" class="usx-add">The men of</span> the tribe of Ephraim did not force the people of the Canaan people-group to leave Gezer <span id="add-JDG.1.29" class="usx-add">city</span>. So the people of the Canaan people-group continued to live with the people of the tribe of Ephraim. <a href="#JDG.1.30"><sup id="JDG.1.30" class="usx-v">30</sup></a>
<span id="add-JDG.1.30" class="usx-add">The men of</span> the tribe of Zebulun did nor compel the people of the Canaan people-group who were living in Kitron and Nahalol <span id="add-JDG.1.30" class="usx-add">cities</span> to leave. They stayed there and lived among the people of the tribe of Zebulun, but the people of Zebulun forced them to work for them as their slaves. <a href="#JDG.1.31"><sup id="JDG.1.31" class="usx-v">31</sup></a>
<span id="add-JDG.1.31" class="usx-add">The men of</span> the tribe of Asher did not force the people of the Canaan people-group who lived in Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Aczib, Helbah, Aphek and Rehob <span id="add-JDG.1.31" class="usx-add">cities</span> to leave. <a href="#JDG.1.32"><sup id="JDG.1.32" class="usx-v">32</sup></a>
So the people of the tribe of Asher lived among them. <a href="#JDG.1.33"><sup id="JDG.1.33" class="usx-v">33</sup></a>
<span id="add-JDG.1.33" class="usx-add">The men of</span> the tribe of Naphtali did not compel the people who lived in Beth-Shemesh and Beth-Anath <span id="add-JDG.1.33" class="usx-add">cities</span> to leave, so the people in those two cities continued to live there, but the people of the Canaan people-group were forced to work as the slaves of the people of the tribe of Naphtali. <a href="#JDG.1.34"><sup id="JDG.1.34" class="usx-v">34</sup></a>
The people of the Amor people-group forced the people of the tribe of Dan to live in the hills. They did not allow them to come down <span id="add-JDG.1.34" class="usx-add">and live</span> on the plain. <a href="#JDG.1.35"><sup id="JDG.1.35" class="usx-v">35</sup></a>
The people of the Amor people-group were determined to stay in Heres Mountain and in Aijalon and Shaalbim <span id="add-JDG.1.35" class="usx-add">cities</span>. But when the Israelis became ◄stronger/more numerous►, they forced the people of the Amor people-group to work as their slaves. <a href="#JDG.1.36"><sup id="JDG.1.36" class="usx-v">36</sup></a>
The land where the Amor people-group lived extended from Scorpion Pass <span id="add-JDG.1.36" class="usx-add">toward the west</span> beyond Sela <span id="add-JDG.1.36" class="usx-add">town</span>, up into the hilly area.</p>

After he told that to all the Israelis, the people cried loudly. <a href="#JDG.2.5"><sup id="JDG.2.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>

After all the people died who lived at the same time as Joshua [EUP], a group of people grew up who did not know Yahweh, and did not know what great things he had done for the Israeli people. <a href="#JDG.2.11-13"><sup id="JDG.2.11-13" class="usx-v">11-13</sup></a>
They did things that Yahweh said were very evil. They worshiped <span id="add-JDG.2.11-13" class="usx-add">idols that represented the god</span> Baal and the goddess Astarte. They worshiped [DOU] the various gods that the people-groups around them worshiped.

So he allowed people from other groups to raid them and steal their crops and animals. They were no longer able to resist their enemies, and Yahweh allowed all their enemies around them to defeat them. <a href="#JDG.2.15"><sup id="JDG.2.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
Whenever the Israelis went to fight <span id="add-JDG.2.15" class="usx-add">their enemies</span>, Yahweh [MTY] was opposing them, and allowed their enemies to defeat them, just as he had promised he would do. So the Israelis were greatly distressed.</p>

But the Israelis still would not pay attention to their leaders.

Whenever Yahweh gave a leader to them, he helped that leader and enabled him to rescue the people from their enemies. He helped them like that as long as that leader was alive.

So Yahweh was very angry with the Israeli people. He said, “These people have disobeyed the agreement I made with their ancestors. They have not done what I told them to do. <a href="#JDG.2.21"><sup id="JDG.2.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>

Yahweh had allowed those people-groups to stay in that land. He did not expel them by allowing Joshua <span id="add-JDG.2.23" class="usx-add">and his men</span> to defeat them.</p>

At that time there were still many people-groups in Canaan. Yahweh left them there to test the Israeli people. But many of the Israelis in Canaan were ones who had not fought in any of the wars in Canaan.

Yahweh left these people-groups there to test the Israelis, to see if they would obey his commands which he had told Moses to give them. <a href="#JDG.3.5"><sup id="JDG.3.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
The Israelis lived among the Canaan people-group, the Hiv people-group, the Amor people-group, the Periz people-group, the Hiv people-group, and the Jebus people-group. <a href="#JDG.3.6"><sup id="JDG.3.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
<span id="add-JDG.3.6" class="usx-add">Moses had told the people not to associate with any of those people</span>.

But when they pleaded to Yahweh <span id="add-JDG.3.9" class="usx-add">to help them</span>, he gave them a leader to rescue them. He was Othniel, the son of Caleb’s younger brother Kenaz. <a href="#JDG.3.10"><sup id="JDG.3.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
Yahweh’s Spirit came upon him, and he became their leader. He <span id="add-JDG.3.10" class="usx-add">led an army that</span> fought against <span id="add-JDG.3.10" class="usx-add">the army of</span> Cushan, and defeated them. <a href="#JDG.3.11"><sup id="JDG.3.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>

After that, the Israelis again did things that Yahweh said were very evil.

Eglon persuaded the leaders of the Ammon and Amalek people-groups to join their armies with his army to attack Israel. They captured <span id="add-JDG.3.13" class="usx-add">Jericho, which was called</span> ‘The City of Palm Trees’. <a href="#JDG.3.14"><sup id="JDG.3.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>

    <a href="#JDG.3.15"><sup id="JDG.3.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
But then the Israelis again pleaded to Yahweh <span id="add-JDG.3.15" class="usx-add">to help them</span>. So he gave them another leader to rescue them. He was Ehud, a left-handed man, the son of Gera, from the descendants of Benjamin. The Israelis sent him to King Eglon to give him their yearly protection money. <a href="#JDG.3.16"><sup id="JDG.3.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
Ehud had with him a double-edged dagger, about a foot and a half long. He strapped it to his right thigh, under his clothes. <a href="#JDG.3.17"><sup id="JDG.3.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
He gave the money to King Eglon, who was a very fat man. <a href="#JDG.3.18"><sup id="JDG.3.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
Then Ehud started to go back home with the men who had carried the money. <a href="#JDG.3.19"><sup id="JDG.3.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
When they arrived at the stone carvings near Gilgal, <span id="add-JDG.3.19" class="usx-add">he told the other men to go on, but</span> he himself turned around and went back <span id="add-JDG.3.19" class="usx-add">to the king of Moab. When he arrived at the palace</span>, he said to the king, “Your majesty, I have a secret message for you.” So the king told all his servants to be quiet, and sent them out of the room.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.3.19" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.3.20"><sup id="JDG.3.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
Then, as Eglon was sitting alone in the upstairs room of his summer palace, Ehud came close to him and said, “I have a message for you from God.” As the king got up from his chair, <a href="#JDG.3.21"><sup id="JDG.3.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
Ehud reached with his left hand and pulled the dagger from his right thigh, and plunged it into the king’s belly. <a href="#JDG.3.22"><sup id="JDG.3.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
He thrust it in so far that the handle went into the king’s belly, and the blade came out the king’s back. Ehud did not pull the dagger out. <span id="add-JDG.3.22" class="usx-add">He left it there, with</span> the handle buried in the king’s fat. <a href="#JDG.3.23"><sup id="JDG.3.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
Then Ehud left the room. He went out to the porch. He shut the doors to the room and locked them.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.3.23" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.3.24"><sup id="JDG.3.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
After he had gone, King Eglon’s servants came back, but they saw that the doors of the room were locked. They said, “The king must be defecating in the inner room.” <a href="#JDG.3.25"><sup id="JDG.3.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
So they waited, but when the king did not open the doors of the room, after a while they were worried. They got a key and unlocked the doors. And they saw that their king was lying on the floor, dead.</p>

    <a href="#JDG.3.26"><sup id="JDG.3.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
Meanwhile, Ehud escaped. He passed by the stone carvings and arrived at Seirah, in the hilly area where the descendants of Ephraim lived. <a href="#JDG.3.27"><sup id="JDG.3.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
There he blew a trumpet <span id="add-JDG.3.27" class="usx-add">to signal that the people should join him to fight the people of Moab</span>. So the Israelis went with him from the hills. They went down <span id="add-JDG.3.27" class="usx-add">toward the Jordan river</span>, with Ehud leading them.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.3.27" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.3.28"><sup id="JDG.3.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
He said to the men, “Yahweh is going to allow us to defeat your enemies, the people of Moab. So follow me!” So they followed him down to the river, and they stationed some of their men at the place where people can walk across the river, in order that they could <span id="add-JDG.3.28" class="usx-add">kill any people from Moab who tried to</span> cross the river <span id="add-JDG.3.28" class="usx-add">to escape</span>. <a href="#JDG.3.29"><sup id="JDG.3.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>

After Ehud died, the Israelis again started doing things Yahweh said were very evil. <a href="#JDG.4.2"><sup id="JDG.4.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
So he allowed the army of Jabin, one of the kings of Canaan land, who ruled in Hazor <span id="add-JDG.4.2" class="usx-add">city</span>, to conquer the Israelis. The commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth-Haggoyim. <a href="#JDG.4.3"><sup id="JDG.4.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
Sisera’s <span id="add-JDG.4.3" class="usx-add">army</span> had 900 chariots. For 20 years he oppressed the Israelis. Then they pleaded to Yahweh to help them.</p>

    <a href="#JDG.4.4"><sup id="JDG.4.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
At that time Deborah, who was the wife of Lappidoth, was a prophetess who had become the leader in Israel. <a href="#JDG.4.5"><sup id="JDG.4.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
She would sit under her palm tree at a place between Ramah and Bethel, in the hilly area where the descendants of Ephraim lived, and people would come to her and ask her to settle disputes between them. <a href="#JDG.4.6"><sup id="JDG.4.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
One day she summoned Barak, the son of Abinoam, when he was in Kedesh, in the area where the descendants of Naphtali lived. She said to him, “This is what Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis worship, is commanding you to do: ‘Take with you 1,000 men, some from the descendants of Naphtali and some from the descendants of Zebulun, and lead them to Tabor Mountain. <a href="#JDG.4.7"><sup id="JDG.4.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Yahweh will lure Sisera, the commander of King Jabin’s army, to come with his chariots and his army, to the Kishon River, <span id="add-JDG.4.7" class="usx-add">a few miles away</span>. I will enable your men to defeat them there.’&#160;”</p>

She replied, “Okay, I will go with you.

So Deborah went with Barak to Kedesh. There he summoned men from Zebulun and Naphtali. Ten thousand men came to him, and then they went together with Deborah <span id="add-JDG.4.10" class="usx-add">to Tabor Mountain</span>.</p>

    <a href="#JDG.4.11"><sup id="JDG.4.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
At that time Heber, one of the descendants of the Ken people-group, had moved <span id="add-JDG.4.11" class="usx-add">with his wife Jael</span> from the area where that group lived, and set up his tent near the big oak tree at Zaanannim, near Kedesh.

As they advanced, Yahweh caused Sisera and all his chariots and his army to have great difficulty maneuvering/moving around. So Sisera jumped down from his chariot and ran away. <a href="#JDG.4.16"><sup id="JDG.4.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
But Barak and his men pursued the other chariots and the enemy soldiers as far as Harosheth-Haggoyim. They killed all of the men in Sisera’s army. Not one man survived.</p>

Sisera was very exhausted, so he soon was asleep. While he was sleeping, Jael crept quietly to him, holding a hammer and a tent peg. She pounded the peg into his skull, and all the way through his head into the ground, and he died.</p>

When Barak passed by Jael’s tent to look for Sisera, she went out to greet him. She said, “Come in, and I will show you the man you are searching for!” So he followed her into the tent, and he saw Sisera lying there, dead, with the tent peg through his head.</p>

Then Yahweh’s Spirit took control of Gideon. He blew a ram’s horn to summon the men to prepare to fight. So the men of the clan of Abiezer came to him. <a href="#JDG.6.35"><sup id="JDG.6.35" class="usx-v">35</sup></a>
He also sent messengers throughout the tribes descended from <span id="add-JDG.6.35" class="usx-add">the four tribes of</span> Manasseh, Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali <span id="add-JDG.6.35" class="usx-add">to tell their soldiers to come</span>, and all of them came.</p>

    <a href="#JDG.6.36"><sup id="JDG.6.36" class="usx-v">36</sup></a>
Then Gideon said to God, “If you are truly going to enable me to rescue the Israeli people as you promised, <a href="#JDG.6.37"><sup id="JDG.6.37" class="usx-v">37</sup></a>
confirm it by doing this: Tonight I will put a dry wool fleece on the ground where I thresh the grain. Tomorrow morning, if the fleece is wet with dew but the ground is dry, then I will know that I am the one you will enable to rescue the people of Israel as you promised.” <a href="#JDG.6.38"><sup id="JDG.6.38" class="usx-v">38</sup></a>
And that is what happened. When Gideon got up the next morning, he picked up the fleece, and squeezed out a whole bowlful of water!</p>
<p id="p-JDG.6.38" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.6.39"><sup id="JDG.6.39" class="usx-v">39</sup></a>
Then Gideon said to God, “Do not be angry with me, but let me ask you to do one more thing. Tonight I will put the fleece out again. This time, let the fleece remain dry, while the ground is wet with the dew.” <a href="#JDG.6.40"><sup id="JDG.6.40" class="usx-v">40</sup></a>
So that night, God did what Gideon asked him to do. The next morning the fleece was dry, but the ground was covered with dew.</p>

The next morning, Gideon and his men got up early and went as far as Harod Spring. The army of Midian was camped north of them, in the valley near Moreh Hill. <a href="#JDG.7.2"><sup id="JDG.7.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
Yahweh said to Gideon, “You have too many soldiers with you. If I allow all of you to fight the army of Midian, <span id="add-JDG.7.2" class="usx-add">if your army defeats them</span>, they will boast to me that they defeated their enemies by themselves, <span id="add-JDG.7.2" class="usx-add">without my help</span>. <a href="#JDG.7.3"><sup id="JDG.7.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
So tell the men, ‘Whoever among you is timid or afraid may leave us and go home.’&#160;” So <span id="add-JDG.7.3" class="usx-add">after Gideon told that to them</span>, 22,000 of them went home. Only 10,000 men were left there.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.7.3" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.7.4"><sup id="JDG.7.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
But Yahweh told Gideon, “There are still too many men! Take them down to the spring, and there I will choose from among them, which ones will go with you and which ones will not go.”.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.7.4" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.7.5"><sup id="JDG.7.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
When Gideon took the men down to the spring, Yahweh told him, “When they drink, put into one group the ones who scoop the water into their hands, and then lap it up like dogs do. Put into another group the ones who kneel down <span id="add-JDG.7.5" class="usx-add">and bend over</span> and drink with their mouths in the water.” <a href="#JDG.7.6"><sup id="JDG.7.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
So when they drank, only 300 men drank from their hands. All the others drank with their mouths down in the water.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.7.6" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.7.7"><sup id="JDG.7.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Then Yahweh told Gideon, “The 300 men who lapped the water from their hands will be your army! I will enable them to defeat the Midian army. Let all the others go home!” <a href="#JDG.7.8"><sup id="JDG.7.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
So Gideon’s 300 men collected the food and rams’ horns from all the other men, and then he sent them home.</p>

That night, Yahweh said to Gideon, “Get up and go down to their camp, <span id="add-JDG.7.9" class="usx-add">and you will hear something that will convince you that</span> I will enable your men to defeat them. <a href="#JDG.7.10"><sup id="JDG.7.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
But if you are afraid to attack them by yourself, take your servant Purah with you. <a href="#JDG.7.11"><sup id="JDG.7.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
Go down and listen to what some of the Midian soldiers are saying. Then you will be very encouraged, and you will be ready to attack their camp.” So Gideon took Purah with him, and they went down to the edge of the enemy camp. <a href="#JDG.7.12"><sup id="JDG.7.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
The armies of the people of Midian and Amalek and from the east had set up their tents and looked like a swarm of locusts. It seemed that their camels were as impossible to count as the grains of sand on the seashore.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.7.12" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.7.13"><sup id="JDG.7.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Gideon crept closer and heard one man telling a friend about a dream. He said, “I just had a dream, and in the dream I saw a round loaf of barley bread tumble down into our Midian camp. It struck a tent so hard that the tent turned upside down and collapsed!”</p>
<p id="p-JDG.7.13" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.7.14"><sup id="JDG.7.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
His friend said, “Your dream can mean only one thing. It means that God will enable Gideon, the man of Israel, to defeat all of the armies that are here with us men from Midian.”</p>
<p id="p-JDG.7.14" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.7.15"><sup id="JDG.7.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
When Gideon heard the <span id="add-JDG.7.15" class="usx-add">man tell about his</span> dream and the meaning of that dream, he thanked God. Then he <span id="add-JDG.7.15" class="usx-add">and Purah</span> returned to the Israeli camp, and he shouted to the men, “Get up! Because God is enabling you to defeat the men from Midian!” <a href="#JDG.7.16"><sup id="JDG.7.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
He divided his men into three groups. He gave each man a ram’s horn and an empty clay jar. He also gave each of them a torch <span id="add-JDG.7.16" class="usx-add">that they lit</span>.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.7.16" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.7.17"><sup id="JDG.7.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
Then he said to them, “Watch me. When we come close to the enemy camp, <span id="add-JDG.7.17" class="usx-add">spread out to surround the camp</span>. Then do exactly what I do. <a href="#JDG.7.18"><sup id="JDG.7.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
As soon as I and the men with me blow our ram’s horns, you men in the other two groups surrounding the camp blow your horns and shout, ‘<span id="add-JDG.7.18" class="usx-add">We are doing this</span> for Yahweh and for Gideon!’”</p>
<p id="p-JDG.7.18" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.7.19"><sup id="JDG.7.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
A while before midnight, just after a new group of Israeli guards took the places of the previous group, Gideon and the 100 men with him arrived at the edge of the Midian camp. Suddenly they all blew their horns, and broke their jars. <a href="#JDG.7.20"><sup id="JDG.7.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
Then the men in all three groups blew their horns and smashed their jars. They held the torches high with their left hands, and held up the horns with their right hands and alternatively blew them and shouted, “<span id="add-JDG.7.20" class="usx-add">We have</span> swords <span id="add-JDG.7.20" class="usx-add">to fight</span> for Yahweh and for Gideon!” <a href="#JDG.7.21"><sup id="JDG.7.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
Each of Gideon’s men stood in his position around the enemy camp. As they watched, all the Midian men started running around and shouting in a panic.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.7.21" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.7.22"><sup id="JDG.7.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
While the 300 Israeli men kept blowing their horns, Yahweh caused their enemies to start fighting each other with their swords/daggers. Some of them killed each other. The rest fled. Some fled south to Beth-Shittah. Some fled to Zerarah <span id="add-JDG.7.22" class="usx-add">village</span>, near Tabbath. <a href="#JDG.7.23"><sup id="JDG.7.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
Then Gideon sent messages to the soldiers in the areas where the descendants of Naphtali, Asher, and Manasseh lived, to tell them to come and pursue the army of Midian. <a href="#JDG.7.24"><sup id="JDG.7.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
He also sent messengers throughout the hilly area where the descendants of Ephraim lived, saying, “Come down to attack the army of Midian. Come down to the Jordan River, to the place where people can wade across, to prevent enemy troops from crossing it! Station men as far south as Beth-Barah.”</p>
<p id="p-JDG.7.24" class="usx-p" >So the men of Ephraim did what Gideon told them to do. <a href="#JDG.7.25"><sup id="JDG.7.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
They also captured Oreb and Zeeb, the two generals of the Midian army. They killed Oreb at <span id="add-JDG.7.25" class="usx-add">the big rock which is now called</span> the rock of Oreb, and they killed Zeeb at <span id="add-JDG.7.25" class="usx-add">the place where people crush grapes that is now called</span> the winepress of Zeeb.

    <a href="#JDG.8.1"><sup id="JDG.8.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
Then the descendants of Ephraim said to Gideon, “Why have you acted toward us like this? When you went out to fight against the people of Midian, why did you not summon us <span id="add-JDG.8.1" class="usx-add">to help you</span>?” They rebuked Gideon severely.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.8.1" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.8.2"><sup id="JDG.8.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
But Gideon replied, “I have done [RHQ] very little compared with what you have done!

God enabled you to defeat Oreb and Zeeb, the generals of the army from Midian. That is [RHQ] much more important than what I did!” After Gideon told them that, they no longer resented what he had done.</p>

    <a href="#JDG.8.4"><sup id="JDG.8.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
Then Gideon and his 300 men <span id="add-JDG.8.4" class="usx-add">went east and</span> crossed the Jordan <span id="add-JDG.8.4" class="usx-add">River</span>. Although they were very tired, they continued to pursue their enemies. <a href="#JDG.8.5"><sup id="JDG.8.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
When they arrived at Succoth <span id="add-JDG.8.5" class="usx-add">town</span>, Gideon said to the town leaders, “Please give my men some food! They are very tired. We are pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.”</p>

But the leaders of Succoth replied, “You have not caught [RHQ] Zebah and Zalmunna yet. So why should we give food to your troops <span id="add-JDG.8.6" class="usx-add">now? Catch them first, and then we will give you food</span>.”</p>
<p id="p-JDG.8.6" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.8.7"><sup id="JDG.8.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Gideon replied, “<span id="add-JDG.8.7" class="usx-add">Because you said that</span>, after Yahweh enables us to defeat Zebah and Zalmunna, we will return. And then we will make whips from thorns from the desert, and with them we will rip the flesh off your bones!”</p>

From there, Gideon <span id="add-JDG.8.8" class="usx-add">and his 300 men</span> went to Peniel and asked for food there, but the people gave him the same answer. <a href="#JDG.8.9"><sup id="JDG.8.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>

By that time, Zebah and Zalmunna had gone to Karkor <span id="add-JDG.8.10" class="usx-add">town</span> with 15,000 troops.

Gideon <span id="add-JDG.8.11" class="usx-add">and his men</span> went east along the road on which caravans travel.

Then Gideon and his men returned to Succoth and said to those leaders, “Here are Zebah and Zalmunna.

Then Gideon’s men took the town leaders and whipped them with whips made from briers from the desert, to teach them <span id="add-JDG.8.16" class="usx-add">that they deserved to be punished for not giving them any food</span>. <a href="#JDG.8.17"><sup id="JDG.8.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>

Then he turned to his oldest son, Jether. He said to him, “Kill them!” But Jether was only a boy, and he was afraid, so he did not pull out his dagger <span id="add-JDG.8.20" class="usx-add">to kill them</span>.</p>

    <a href="#JDG.8.21"><sup id="JDG.8.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
Then Zebah and Zalmunna said to Gideon, “Do not ask a young boy to do the work that a man should do!” So Gideon killed both of them. Then he took the gold ornaments from the necks of their camels.</p>

Gideon made/decorated a sacred vest from the gold, and later he put it in his hometown, Ophrah. But soon the Israeli people started to worship the vest.

One day when Samson was in Timnah <span id="add-JDG.14.1" class="usx-add">town</span>, he saw a young Philistine woman there. <a href="#JDG.14.2"><sup id="JDG.14.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
When he returned home, he told his mother and father, “I saw a young Philistine woman in Timnah, and I want you to get her for me so I can marry her.”</p>
<p id="p-JDG.14.2" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.14.3"><sup id="JDG.14.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
His mother and father objected very strongly. They said, “Is there no woman from our tribe, or from the other Israeli tribes, that you could marry? Why must you go to the heathen Philistines to get a wife?”</p>
<p id="p-JDG.14.3" class="usx-p" >But Samson told his father, “Get her for me! She is the one I want!” <a href="#JDG.14.4"><sup id="JDG.14.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
His mother and father did not realize that Yahweh was arranging this. He was preparing a way for <span id="add-JDG.14.4" class="usx-add">Samson to defeat</span> the Philistines, who were ruling over Israel at that time. <a href="#JDG.14.5"><sup id="JDG.14.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
So, as Samson was going down to Timnah, followed by his mother and father, a young lion attacked Samson near the vineyards close to Timnah. <a href="#JDG.14.6"><sup id="JDG.14.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
Then Yahweh’s Spirit came upon Samson powerfully, with the result that he tore the lion apart with his hands. He did it <span id="add-JDG.14.6" class="usx-add">as easily</span> as if it were a young goat. But he did not tell his mother and father about it. <a href="#JDG.14.7"><sup id="JDG.14.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
When they arrived in Timnah, Samson talked with the young woman, and he liked her very much. <span id="add-JDG.14.7" class="usx-add">And his father made arrangements for the wedding</span>.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.14.7" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.14.8"><sup id="JDG.14.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
Later, when Samson returned to Timnah for the wedding, he turned off the path to see the carcass of the lion. He discovered that <span id="add-JDG.14.8" class="usx-add">after other creatures had eaten all the flesh</span>, a swarm of bees <span id="add-JDG.14.8" class="usx-add">had made a hive in the skeleton and</span> had made some honey. <a href="#JDG.14.9"><sup id="JDG.14.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
So he scooped some of the honey into his hands and ate some of it as he was walking along. He also gave some of it to his mother and father, but he did not tell them that he had taken the honey from the skeleton of the lion, <span id="add-JDG.14.9" class="usx-add">because anyone dedicated to God was not to touch any corpse</span>.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.14.9" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.14.10"><sup id="JDG.14.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
As his father was making the final arrangements for the marriage, Samson gave a party <span id="add-JDG.14.10" class="usx-add">for the young men in that area</span>. That was the custom for men to do when they were about to be married. <a href="#JDG.14.11"><sup id="JDG.14.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
Thirty young man were invited to the party.</p>

    <a href="#JDG.14.12"><sup id="JDG.14.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
Samson said to them, “Allow me to tell you a riddle. If you tel me the meaning of my riddle during these seven days of the celebration, I will give each of you a linen robe and an extra set of clothes. <a href="#JDG.14.13"><sup id="JDG.14.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
But if you cannot tell me the meaning, you must each give me a linen robe and an extra set of clothes.” They replied, “All right. Tell us your riddle.”</p>
<p id="p-JDG.14.13" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.14.14"><sup id="JDG.14.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>

<p id="q2-JDG.14.14" class="usx-q2" >out of something strong came something sweet.”</p>

    <a href="#JDG.14.15"><sup id="JDG.14.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
On the fourth day, they said to Samson’s bride, “Ask your husband to tell you the meaning of the riddle. If you do not do that, we will burn down your father’s house, with you inside it! Did you invite us here only to make us poor <span id="add-JDG.14.15" class="usx-add">by forcing us to buy a lot of clothes for your husband</span>?”</p>
<p id="p-JDG.14.15" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.14.16"><sup id="JDG.14.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
So Samson’s wife came to him, crying, and said to him, “You do not really love me. You hate me! You have told a riddle to my friends, but you have not told me the meaning of the riddle!”</p>
<p id="p-JDG.14.16" class="usx-p" >He replied, “I have not told the meaning of the riddle even to my mother and father, so why should I tell it to you?” <a href="#JDG.14.17"><sup id="JDG.14.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
She continued to cry every time she was with him, all during the rest of the celebration. Finally, on the seventh day, because she continued to nag him, he told her the meaning of the riddle. Then she told it to the young men.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.14.17" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.14.18"><sup id="JDG.14.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
So, before sunset on the seventh day, the young men came to Samson and said to him,</p>

    <a href="#JDG.14.19"><sup id="JDG.14.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
Then Yahweh’s Spirit powerfully took control of Samson.

Samson replied, “No! And this time I have a right to get revenge on you Philistines!” <a href="#JDG.15.4"><sup id="JDG.15.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>

Then he lit the torches and let the foxes run through the fields of the Philistines.

Then he saw a donkey’s jawbone lying on the ground. It was fresh, <span id="add-JDG.15.15" class="usx-add">so it was hard</span>. He picked it up and killed about 1,000 Philistine men with it. <a href="#JDG.15.16"><sup id="JDG.15.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
Then Samson wrote this poem:</p>
<p id="q1-JDG.15.16" class="usx-q1" >“With the jawbone of a donkey</p>
<p id="q2-JDG.15.16" class="usx-q2" >I have made them like a heap of <span id="add-JDG.15.16" class="usx-add">dead</span> donkeys.</p>
<p id="q1-JDG.15.16" class="usx-q1" >With the jawbone of a donkey</p>
<p id="q2-JDG.15.16" class="usx-q2" >I killed 1,000 men.”</p>

    <a href="#JDG.15.17"><sup id="JDG.15.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
When he finished killing those men, he threw the jawbone away, and later that place was called Jawbone Hill.</p>

    <a href="#JDG.15.18"><sup id="JDG.15.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
Then Samson was very thirsty, so he called out to Yahweh, “You have given me strength to win a great victory. So now must I die because of being thirsty, with the result that those heathen Philistines will take away my body <span id="add-JDG.15.18" class="usx-add">and mutilate it</span>?” <a href="#JDG.15.19"><sup id="JDG.15.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
So God caused water to gush out of a depression in the ground at Lehi. Samson drank from it and soon felt strong again. He named that place ‘The spring of the one who called out’. That spring is still there at Lehi.</p>

    <a href="#JDG.15.20"><sup id="JDG.15.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
Samson was the leader of the Israeli people for 20 years, but during that time the Philistines <span id="add-JDG.15.20" class="usx-add">were the ones who really ruled over the land</span>.</p>
<a href="#JDG.16"><h3 id="JDG.16" class="usx-c">16</h3></a>

One day Samson went to Gaza <span id="add-JDG.16.1" class="usx-add">city in the Philistia area</span>. He spent some time with a prostitute. <a href="#JDG.16.2"><sup id="JDG.16.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
People soon found out that Samson was there, so the men of Gaza gathered together at the city gate and waited all night. They said to themselves, “When it dawns tomorrow morning, we will kill him <span id="add-JDG.16.2" class="usx-add">when he tries to leave the city</span>.”</p>
<p id="p-JDG.16.2" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.16.3"><sup id="JDG.16.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
But Samson did not stay there all night. At midnight, he got up. He went to the city gate, he took hold of its two posts, and he lifted it up out of the ground, with its <span id="add-JDG.16.3" class="usx-add">connecting cross</span> bar still attached. He put it on his shoulders and carried it <span id="add-JDG.16.3" class="usx-add">many miles</span> uphill to Hebron.</p>

    <a href="#JDG.16.4"><sup id="JDG.16.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
Later Samson fell in love with a woman named Delilah, <span id="add-JDG.16.4" class="usx-add">and started to live with her</span>. She lived in Sorek Valley <span id="add-JDG.16.4" class="usx-add">in the Philistia area</span>. <a href="#JDG.16.5"><sup id="JDG.16.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
The Philistine leaders went to her and said, “Find out from Samson what makes him so strong. And find out how we can subdue him and tie him up securely. If you do that, each of us will give you 1,100 pieces of silver.”</p>
<p id="p-JDG.16.5" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.16.6"><sup id="JDG.16.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
So Delilah said to Samson, “Please tell me what makes you so strong, and tell me how someone can subdue you and tie you up.”</p>

    <a href="#JDG.16.7"><sup id="JDG.16.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Samson said, “If someone ties me with seven new bowstrings, ones that are not dry yet, I will become as weak as other men.”</p>

    <a href="#JDG.16.8"><sup id="JDG.16.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
So <span id="add-JDG.16.8" class="usx-add">after Delilah told that to the Philistine leaders</span>, they brought seven new bowstrings to Delilah. <a href="#JDG.16.9"><sup id="JDG.16.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
Then she hid the men in one of the rooms in her house. Then <span id="add-JDG.16.9" class="usx-add">while Samson was sleeping</span>, she tied him up with the bowstrings. Then she called out, “Samson! The Philistines have come here to capture you!” But Samson snapped the bowstrings as easily as though they were strings that had been singed in a fire. So the Philistines did not find out what made Samson so strong.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.16.9" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.16.10"><sup id="JDG.16.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
Then Delilah said to Samson, “You have deceived me and lied to me! Now tell me <span id="add-JDG.16.10" class="usx-add">the truth,</span> how someone can tie you up securely.”</p>
<p id="p-JDG.16.10" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.16.11"><sup id="JDG.16.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
Samson replied, “If someone ties me with new ropes, ones that have never been used, I will be as weak as other men.”</p>

    <a href="#JDG.16.12"><sup id="JDG.16.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
So again, <span id="add-JDG.16.12" class="usx-add">she told the Philistine leaders, and</span> they <span id="add-JDG.16.12" class="usx-add">came and</span> hid in the room as they had done before.

    <a href="#JDG.16.13"><sup id="JDG.16.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Then Delilah said, “You have deceived me and lied to me <span id="add-JDG.16.13" class="usx-add">again</span>! Please tell me how someone can tie you up securely!” Samson replied, “If you weave the seven braids of my hair into the threads you are weaving on the loom, and then fasten those threads with the pin <span id="add-JDG.16.13" class="usx-add">that makes the threads tight</span>, then I will be as weak as other men.”</p>
<p id="p-JDG.16.13" class="usx-p" >So again, while Samson was sleeping on her lap, Delilah held the seven braids of his hair, and wove them into the threads on the loom, <a href="#JDG.16.14"><sup id="JDG.16.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
and she tightened them with the pin. Then she called out, “Samson! The Philistines have come to capture you!” But Samson woke up and pulled out the pin, and pulled his hair from the threads on the loom.</p>

    <a href="#JDG.16.15"><sup id="JDG.16.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
Then Delilah said to him, “How can you say that you love me when you do not tell me the truth about yourself? You have deceived me three times, and you still have not told me what really makes you so strong!” <a href="#JDG.16.16"><sup id="JDG.16.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
Day after day she nagged him like that. He thought he would die from her nagging [IDM].</p>

    <a href="#JDG.16.17"><sup id="JDG.16.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
Finally Samson told her the truth. He said, “I have been set apart for God since the day I was born. And because of that, my hair has never been cut. If my hair were shaved off, my strength would be gone, and I would be as weak as other men.”</p>
<p id="p-JDG.16.17" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.16.18"><sup id="JDG.16.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
Delilah realized that this time he had told her the truth. So she summoned the Philistine leaders again, saying, “Come back one more time, because Samson has really told me everything <span id="add-JDG.16.18" class="usx-add">about why he is so strong</span>”. So the Philistine leaders returned and brought to Delilah the money <span id="add-JDG.16.18" class="usx-add">that they promised to give her</span>. <a href="#JDG.16.19"><sup id="JDG.16.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
Again she lulled Samson to sleep, with his head in her lap. Then she called one of the Philistine men to come and shave off Samson’s hair. As he did that, Samson began to get weaker. And finally his strength was all gone.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.16.19" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.16.20"><sup id="JDG.16.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
Then <span id="add-JDG.16.20" class="usx-add">after she tied him up</span>, she called out, “Samson! The Philistines have come to capture you!”</p>

    <a href="#JDG.16.21"><sup id="JDG.16.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
So the Philistine men seized him and gouged out his eyes. Then they took him to Gaza. There they put him in prison and bound him with bronze chains. They made him <span id="add-JDG.16.21" class="usx-add">turn a millstone to</span> grind grain <span id="add-JDG.16.21" class="usx-add">every day</span>. <a href="#JDG.16.22"><sup id="JDG.16.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
But his hair started to grow again.</p>
<p id="s1-JDG.16.22" class="usx-s1" >Samson killed many thousands of Philistines when he died</p>

    <span id="add-JDG.16.23" class="usx-add">Several months later</span> the Philistine leaders celebrated a big festival. During the festival they offered sacrifices to their god Dagon. They praised him, saying, “Our god has enabled us to defeat our great enemy Samson!”</p>

    <a href="#JDG.16.24"><sup id="JDG.16.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
And when the other people saw Samson, they also praised their god Dagon, saying,</p>

<p id="q2-JDG.16.24" class="usx-q2" >but our god has put our enemy into our hands.</p>

    <a href="#JDG.16.25"><sup id="JDG.16.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
By that time the people were half-drunk. They shouted, “Bring Samson out of the prison! Bring him here so that he can entertain us!”</p>
<p id="p-JDG.16.25" class="usx-p" >So they brought Samson from the prison and made fun of him. Then they made him stand in the center of the temple. They made him stand between the two pillars that held up the roof. <a href="#JDG.16.26"><sup id="JDG.16.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>
Samson said to the servant who was leading him by his hand, “Place my hands against the two pillars. I want to rest against them.” <a href="#JDG.16.27"><sup id="JDG.16.27" class="usx-v">27</sup></a>
At that time the temple was full of men and women. All the Philistine leaders were also there. And there were about 3,000 people on the roof, watching Samson and making fun of him. <a href="#JDG.16.28"><sup id="JDG.16.28" class="usx-v">28</sup></a>
Then Samson prayed, saying, “Yahweh, my Lord, think about me again! Please give me strength one more time, so that I may get revenge on the Philistines for gouging out my eyes!” <a href="#JDG.16.29"><sup id="JDG.16.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>
Then Samson put his hands on the two center pillars of the temple. He put his right hand on one pillar and his left hand on the other pillar. <a href="#JDG.16.30"><sup id="JDG.16.30" class="usx-v">30</sup></a>
Then he shouted <span id="add-JDG.16.30" class="usx-add">to God</span>, “Let me die with the Philistines!”, and he pushed with all his strength. <span id="add-JDG.16.30" class="usx-add">The pillars collapsed</span>, and the temple crashed down on the Philistine leaders and all the other Philistine people, <span id="add-JDG.16.30" class="usx-add">and they all died</span>.

    <a href="#JDG.16.31"><sup id="JDG.16.31" class="usx-v">31</sup></a>
Later his brothers and their relatives went down <span id="add-JDG.16.31" class="usx-add">from Zorah to Gaza</span> to get his body.

After they had gone a little distance from Micah’s house, Micah <span id="add-JDG.18.22" class="usx-add">saw what was happening.

Laish was far from <span id="add-JDG.18.28" class="usx-add">the city of</span> Sidon, <span id="add-JDG.18.28" class="usx-add">so the people of Sidon could not rescue the people of Laish</span>.

Then her husband took his servant and two donkeys and went to Bethlehem. He went to ask her to come back to live with him again. When he arrived at her father’s house, she invited him to come in. Her father was happy to see him. <a href="#JDG.19.4"><sup id="JDG.19.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>

    <a href="#JDG.20.17"><sup id="JDG.20.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
There were 400,000 men from the other Israeli tribes who had swords.</p>

    <a href="#JDG.20.18"><sup id="JDG.20.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
Those other Israelis went up to Bethel and asked God, “Which tribe should be the first to attack the men from the tribe of Benjamin?”</p>
<p id="p-JDG.20.18" class="usx-p" >Yahweh answered, “<span id="add-JDG.20.18" class="usx-add">The men from the tribe of</span> Judah should go first.”</p>
<p id="p-JDG.20.18" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.20.19"><sup id="JDG.20.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
The next morning, the Israeli men went and set up their tents near Gibeah. <a href="#JDG.20.20"><sup id="JDG.20.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
Then they went to fight against <span id="add-JDG.20.20" class="usx-add">the men from the tribe of</span> Benjamin, and stood in their positions for fighting a battle, <span id="add-JDG.20.20" class="usx-add">facing Gibeah</span>. <a href="#JDG.20.21"><sup id="JDG.20.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
The men of the tribe of Benjamin came out of Gibeah and fought against them, and they killed 22,000 Israeli men on that day. <a href="#JDG.20.22-23"><sup id="JDG.20.22-23" class="usx-v">22-23</sup></a>
<span id="add-JDG.20.22-23" class="usx-add">Late that afternoon</span>, the <span id="add-JDG.20.22-23" class="usx-add">remaining</span> Israeli men went to the place of worship and cried until the sun set. Then they asked Yahweh, “Should we attack the men of the tribe of Benjamin again, even though they are our fellow Israelis?”</p>
<p id="p-JDG.20.22-23" class="usx-p" >Yahweh replied, “Yes, attack them again.” So the Israeli men encouraged each other. <a href="#JDG.20.24"><sup id="JDG.20.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
The next day they again stood in their positions for fighting, just like they had done on the previous day. <a href="#JDG.20.25"><sup id="JDG.20.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
The men of the tribe of Benjamin came out of Gibeah and attacked the Israelis, and killed 18,000 more of their men.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.20.25" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.20.26"><sup id="JDG.20.26" class="usx-v">26</sup></a>

    <span id="add-JDG.20.26" class="usx-add">In the afternoon</span>, all the people of Israel <span id="add-JDG.20.26" class="usx-add">who had not been killed</span> again went to Bethel. There they sat down and cried to Yahweh, and they ◄fasted/abstained from eating food► until it was evening. They brought some offerings which they burned completely <span id="add-JDG.20.26" class="usx-add">on the altar</span>, and they also brought some offerings to maintain fellowship with Yahweh. <a href="#JDG.20.27-28"><sup id="JDG.20.27-28" class="usx-v">27-28</sup></a>
At that time, the Sacred Chest that contained the stone tablets on which were written the Ten Commandments was there at Bethel. A priest named Phinehas, the son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron, often stood in front of that chest <span id="add-JDG.20.27-28" class="usx-add">and talked with Yahweh</span>. While he stood there on that day, he asked Yahweh, “Shall we go again to fight against our fellow Israelis from the tribe of Benjamin, or shall we stop fighting against them?”</p>
<p id="p-JDG.20.27-28" class="usx-p" >Yahweh answered, “Go again tomorrow, because tomorrow I will enable you to defeat them.” <a href="#JDG.20.29"><sup id="JDG.20.29" class="usx-v">29</sup></a>
So <span id="add-JDG.20.29" class="usx-add">the next day, 10,000 of</span> the Israeli men ◄set up ambushes/went to hide► <span id="add-JDG.20.29" class="usx-add">in the fields</span> around Gibeah. <a href="#JDG.20.30"><sup id="JDG.20.30" class="usx-v">30</sup></a>
The <span id="add-JDG.20.30" class="usx-add">other</span> Israeli men went and stood in their positions for fighting a battle just like they had done on the previous days. <a href="#JDG.20.31"><sup id="JDG.20.31" class="usx-v">31</sup></a>
When the men of the tribe of Benjamin came out of the city to fight against them, the Israeli men retreated away from the city, and the men of the tribe of Benjamin pursued them. The men of the tribe of Benjamin killed many Israelis, like they had done before. They killed about 30 Israelis. They killed some in the fields, and they killed some on the road that went to Bethel and on the road that went to Gibeah.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.20.31" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.20.32"><sup id="JDG.20.32" class="usx-v">32</sup></a>
The men of the tribe of Benjamin said, “We are defeating them like we did before!” But then Israeli men did what they had planned. The main group of Israeli men retreated a short distance from the city, to <span id="add-JDG.20.32" class="usx-add">trick</span> the men of Gibeah and cause them to pursue the Israeli men along the roads outside the city.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.20.32" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.20.33"><sup id="JDG.20.33" class="usx-v">33</sup></a>
The main group of Israeli men left their positions and retreated, and then they stood in their battle positions again at a place named Baal-Tamar. <a href="#JDG.20.34"><sup id="JDG.20.34" class="usx-v">34</sup></a>
Then <span id="add-JDG.20.34" class="usx-add">while the men of Gibeah were running out of the city toward them</span>, the other 10,000 Israelis came out from the places where they had been hiding, west of Gibeah. They were men who had come from all parts of Israel. There was a very big battle. But the men of the tribe of Benjamin did not know that they were about to suffer a disastrous defeat. <a href="#JDG.20.35"><sup id="JDG.20.35" class="usx-v">35</sup></a>
Yahweh enabled the Israeli men to defeat the men of the tribe of Benjamin. They killed 25,000 of them, even though they all were using swords.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.20.35" class="usx-p" >
    <span id="add-JDG.20.35" class="usx-add">This is what happened</span>: <a href="#JDG.20.36-38"><sup id="JDG.20.36-38" class="usx-v">36-38</sup></a>
The main group of Israeli men arranged with the men who would be hiding that they should send up a smoke signal to enable the main group of soldiers to know when they should attack. Then the main group of Israeli men retreated for a short distance, because they knew that the other Israeli men who had been hiding on the other side of Gibeah would attack the people of the tribe of Benjamin by surprise. So <span id="add-JDG.20.36-38" class="usx-add">after the main group of Israeli men retreated a little distance</span>, the men who had been hiding rushed out and ran into Gibeah and used their swords to kill everyone in the city. <span id="add-JDG.20.36-38" class="usx-add">Then they started to burn the buildings</span>.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.20.36-38" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.20.39"><sup id="JDG.20.39" class="usx-v">39</sup></a>
By that time, the men of the tribe of Benjamin said, “We are winning the battle, as we did before!” <a href="#JDG.20.40"><sup id="JDG.20.40" class="usx-v">40</sup></a>
But then smoke <span id="add-JDG.20.40" class="usx-add">from the burning buildings</span> began to rise up from the city. The men of the tribe of Benjamin turned around and saw that the whole city was burning. <a href="#JDG.20.41"><sup id="JDG.20.41" class="usx-v">41</sup></a>
Then the main group of Israeli men <span id="add-JDG.20.41" class="usx-add">also saw the smoke, and they knew that the smoke signaled that they should</span> turn around and begin to attack. The men of the tribe of Benjamin were very afraid, because they realized that they were about to suffer a disastrous defeat. <a href="#JDG.20.42"><sup id="JDG.20.42" class="usx-v">42</sup></a>
So the men of the tribe of Benjamin tried to run away toward the desert to escape from the Israeli men, but they were not able to escape, because the Israeli men who had burned the two cities came out of those cities and killed many of them. <a href="#JDG.20.43"><sup id="JDG.20.43" class="usx-v">43</sup></a>
They surrounded <span id="add-JDG.20.43" class="usx-add">some of</span> the men of the tribe of Benjamin, and pursued the others to the area east of Gibeah. <a href="#JDG.20.44"><sup id="JDG.20.44" class="usx-v">44</sup></a>
They killed 18,000 strong soldiers of the tribe of Benjamin. <a href="#JDG.20.45"><sup id="JDG.20.45" class="usx-v">45</sup></a>
Then the rest of the men of the tribe of Benjamin realized that they had been defeated. They ran toward the desert to Rimmon Rock, but the Israeli men killed 5,000 more men of the tribe of Benjamin along the roads. They pursued the rest of them to Gidom, and they killed 2,000 more men of the tribe of Benjamin there.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.20.45" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.20.46"><sup id="JDG.20.46" class="usx-v">46</sup></a>
Altogether, there were 25,000 men of the tribe of Benjamin who were killed, all of whom had swords. <a href="#JDG.20.47"><sup id="JDG.20.47" class="usx-v">47</sup></a>
But 600 men of the tribe of Benjamin ran to Rimmon Rock in the desert. They stayed there for four months. <a href="#JDG.20.48"><sup id="JDG.20.48" class="usx-v">48</sup></a>
Then the Israeli men went back to the land belonging to the tribe of Benjamin, and killed the people in every city. They also killed all the animals, and destroyed everything else that they found there. And they burned all the cities that they came to.</p>
<a href="#JDG.21"><h3 id="JDG.21" class="usx-c">21</h3></a>
<p id="s1-JDG.21" class="usx-s1" >They found wives for the men of the tribe of Benjamin</p>
<p id="p-JDG.21" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.21.1"><sup id="JDG.21.1" class="usx-v">1</sup></a>
When the Israeli men gathered at Mizpah <span id="add-JDG.21.1" class="usx-add">before the battle started</span>, they vowed, “None of us will ever allow one of our daughters to marry any man from the tribe of Benjamin!” <a href="#JDG.21.2"><sup id="JDG.21.2" class="usx-v">2</sup></a>
But now the Israelis went to Bethel and they cried loudly to Yahweh all day, until the sun went down. <a href="#JDG.21.3"><sup id="JDG.21.3" class="usx-v">3</sup></a>
They kept saying, “Yahweh, God of us Israeli people, <span id="add-JDG.21.3" class="usx-add">it is as though</span> one of the tribes of us Israelis does not exist any more! ◄Why has this happened to us?/It is terrible that this has happened to us!►” [RHQ]</p>
<p id="p-JDG.21.3" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.21.4"><sup id="JDG.21.4" class="usx-v">4</sup></a>
Early the next morning the people built an altar. Then they completely burned some sacrifices <span id="add-JDG.21.4" class="usx-add">on the altar</span>, and also offered other sacrifices to maintain fellowship with God.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.21.4" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.21.5"><sup id="JDG.21.5" class="usx-v">5</sup></a>
Then, because they had vowed that anyone who did not meet with them at Mizpah <span id="add-JDG.21.5" class="usx-add">to help fight the men of the tribe of Benjamin</span> would be killed, they asked among themselves, “Were there any of the tribes of Israel who did not come to Mizpah to meet with us in the presence of Yahweh?”</p>
<p id="p-JDG.21.5" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.21.6"><sup id="JDG.21.6" class="usx-v">6</sup></a>
The Israelis felt sorry for their fellow Israelis from the tribe of Benjamin. They said, “Today one of our Israeli tribes ◄has disappeared/no longer exists►. <a href="#JDG.21.7"><sup id="JDG.21.7" class="usx-v">7</sup></a>
Yahweh heard us solemnly declare that we would not allow any of our daughters to marry any man from the tribe of Benjamin. What can we do to make certain that the men of the tribe of Benjamin who were not killed will have wives?” <a href="#JDG.21.8"><sup id="JDG.21.8" class="usx-v">8</sup></a>
Then <span id="add-JDG.21.8" class="usx-add">one of</span> them asked, “What group from any of the tribes of Israel did not send any men here to Mizpah?” <a href="#JDG.21.9"><sup id="JDG.21.9" class="usx-v">9</sup></a>
<span id="add-JDG.21.9" class="usx-add">They realized that</span> when the soldiers were counted, there was no one from Jabesh-Gilead <span id="add-JDG.21.9" class="usx-add">city</span> who had come there.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.21.9" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.21.10"><sup id="JDG.21.10" class="usx-v">10</sup></a>
So all the Israelis decided to send 12,000 very good soldiers to Jabesh-Gilead to kill the people there with their swords, even to kill the married women and children. <a href="#JDG.21.11"><sup id="JDG.21.11" class="usx-v">11</sup></a>
<span id="add-JDG.21.11" class="usx-add">They told this to those men</span>: “This is what you must do: You must kill every man in Jabesh-Gilead. You must also kill every married woman. <span id="add-JDG.21.11" class="usx-add">But do not kill the unmarried women</span>.” <a href="#JDG.21.12"><sup id="JDG.21.12" class="usx-v">12</sup></a>
So those soldiers <span id="add-JDG.21.12" class="usx-add">went to Jabesh-Gilead and killed all the men, married women, and children. But they</span> found 400 unmarried young women there. So they brought them to their camp at Shiloh, in Canaan, <span id="add-JDG.21.12" class="usx-add">across the river from the Gilead area that belonged to the tribe of Benjamin</span>.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.21.12" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.21.13"><sup id="JDG.21.13" class="usx-v">13</sup></a>
Then all the Israelis <span id="add-JDG.21.13" class="usx-add">who had gathered</span> sent a message to the 600 men who were at Rimmon Rock. They said that they would like to make peace with them. <a href="#JDG.21.14"><sup id="JDG.21.14" class="usx-v">14</sup></a>
So the men came back from Rimmon Rock. The Israelis gave to them the women from Jabesh-Gilead whom they had not killed. But there were <span id="add-JDG.21.14" class="usx-add">only 400 women. But there were</span> not enough women <span id="add-JDG.21.14" class="usx-add">for those 600 men</span>.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.21.14" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.21.15"><sup id="JDG.21.15" class="usx-v">15</sup></a>
The Israelis <span id="add-JDG.21.15" class="usx-add">still</span> felt sorry for the men of the tribe of Benjamin, because Yahweh had ◄decimated/almost wiped out► one of the Israeli tribes. <a href="#JDG.21.16"><sup id="JDG.21.16" class="usx-v">16</sup></a>
The Israeli leaders said, “We have killed all the married women of the tribe of Benjamin. Where can we get women to be wives of the men who are still alive? <a href="#JDG.21.17"><sup id="JDG.21.17" class="usx-v">17</sup></a>
These men must have wives to give birth to children, in order that their families will continue. If that does not happen, all the people of one of the tribes of Israel will die. <a href="#JDG.21.18"><sup id="JDG.21.18" class="usx-v">18</sup></a>
But we cannot allow our daughters to marry these men, because we vowed that Yahweh will curse anyone who gives one of his daughters to become a wife of any man of the tribe of Benjamin.” <a href="#JDG.21.19"><sup id="JDG.21.19" class="usx-v">19</sup></a>
Then <span id="add-JDG.21.19" class="usx-add">one of</span> them ◄had an idea/thought of something that they could do►. He said, “Every year there is a festival to honor Yahweh at Shiloh, which is north of Bethel and east of the road that extends from Bethel to Shechem, and it is south of Lebonah <span id="add-JDG.21.19" class="usx-add">city</span>.”</p>
<p id="p-JDG.21.19" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.21.20"><sup id="JDG.21.20" class="usx-v">20</sup></a>
So the Israeli leaders told the men of the tribe of Benjamin, “<span id="add-JDG.21.20" class="usx-add">When it is the time for that festival</span>, go to Shiloh and hide in the vineyards. <a href="#JDG.21.21"><sup id="JDG.21.21" class="usx-v">21</sup></a>
Keep watching for the young women to come out of the city to dance. <span id="add-JDG.21.21" class="usx-add">When they come out</span>, all of you should run out of the vineyards. Each of you can seize one of the young women of Shiloh. Then you can all return to your homes <span id="add-JDG.21.21" class="usx-add">with those women</span>. <a href="#JDG.21.22"><sup id="JDG.21.22" class="usx-v">22</sup></a>
If their fathers or brothers come to us and complain <span id="add-JDG.21.22" class="usx-add">about what you have done</span>, we will say to them, ‘Be kind to the men of the tribe of Benjamin. When we fought them, we did not leave any women alive to become their wives, and you did not give those young women to the men from the tribe of Benjamin. <span id="add-JDG.21.22" class="usx-add">They stole them</span>. So you will not be guilty, <span id="add-JDG.21.22" class="usx-add">even though you said that you would not allow any of your daughters to marry one of them</span>.’&#160;”</p>
<p id="p-JDG.21.22" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.21.23"><sup id="JDG.21.23" class="usx-v">23</sup></a>
So that is what the men of the tribe of Benjamin did. <span id="add-JDG.21.23" class="usx-add">They went to Shiloh at the time of the festival</span>. And when the young women were dancing, each man caught one of them and took her away and married her. Then they took their wives back to the land that God had given to them. They rebuilt their cities <span id="add-JDG.21.23" class="usx-add">that had been burned down</span>, and they lived there.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.21.23" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.21.24"><sup id="JDG.21.24" class="usx-v">24</sup></a>
The other Israelis went to their homes in the areas where their tribes and clans lived, the areas that God had allotted to them.</p>
<p id="p-JDG.21.24" class="usx-p" >
    <a href="#JDG.21.25"><sup id="JDG.21.25" class="usx-v">25</sup></a>
At that time, the Israeli people did not have a king. Everyone did what they themselves thought was right.</p>
