<p>The people God is pleased with</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    God is pleased with those who do not do what [MET] wicked people advise them to do,</p><p>and who do not imitate the behavior of [MET] sinful people,</p><p>and who do not join in with people who ◄ridicule/sneer at► God.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Those whom God is pleased with delight in doing the things that he has instructed/taught us to do.</p><p>They read and think about Yahweh’s requirements, day and night.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>They constantly produce/do things that please God</p><p>just like fruit trees that have been planted along the banks of a stream produce fruit at the right time every year.</p><p>
    Like trees that never wither,</p><p>they succeed in everything that they do.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>But wicked people are not like that!</p><p>Wicked people are as worthless as chaff</p><p>that is blown away by the wind.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Therefore, wicked people ◄will not be acquitted/will be condemned► [LIT] when God judges people,</p><p>and furthermore, sinful people will not even be present when God gathers righteous people together,</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>because he guides and protects righteous people,</p><p>but the path that the wicked walk on leads them to where they will be destroyed/punished by God forever.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-2"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-2">2</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>◄Why do the leaders of nations rage against God?/It is foolish for the nations to be angry with God► [RHQ].</p><p>◄Why do people plan to rebel against God even though it is in vain?/It is useless for people to plan to rebel against God► [RHQ]!</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>The kings of the nations prepare to revolt;</p><p>the rulers plot together to fight against Yahweh and against his chosen king.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>They shout, “We should free ourselves from their control [MET];</p><p>we should not let them rule over us any longer!”</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>But Yahweh, the one who sits on his throne in heaven, laughs at them;</p><p>he ridicules those rulers.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Then, because he is angry with them, he rebukes them.</p><p>He causes them to be terrified when they realize that he will furiously punish them.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    Yahweh says, “I have installed my king on Zion, my sacred hill in Jerusalem.”</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    And his king says, “I will proclaim what Yahweh has decreed.</p><p>He said to me, ‘It is as though you are my son;</p><p>today I have declared to everyone that it is as though [MET] I am your father.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Ask me to give you the nations,</p><p>so that they belong to you to rule over them permanently,</p><p>and I will give them to you.</p><p>
    Even the most remote nations will be yours.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>You will defeat them completely [MET];</p><p>you will destroy them like people smash a clay pot with an iron rod [SIM].’”</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>So then, you kings and other rulers on the earth, act wisely!</p><p>
    Heed what Yahweh is warning you!</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Serve Yahweh, fervently revering him;</p><p>Rejoice about what he has done for you, but tremble before him!</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Bow down humbly before his son!</p><p>If you do not do that, Yahweh will be angry,</p><p>and he will suddenly get rid of you.</p><p>Do not forget that he can very quickly show that he is very angry!</p><p>But he is very pleased with all those who request him to protect them [MET].</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-3"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-3">3</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David when he fled from his son Absalom</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh, I have many enemies [DOU]!</p><p>There are many people who oppose/rebel against me.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Many people are saying about me,</p><p>“God will certainly not help him!”</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>But Yahweh, you are like a shield that protects me [MET].</p><p>You greatly honor me, and you encourage me (OR, enable me to triumph over my enemies) [IDM].</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>I cry out to you, Yahweh,</p><p>and you answer me from Zion, your sacred hill.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    At night I lie down and sleep, and I awake in the morning feeling good/refreshed</p><p>because you, Yahweh, ◄take care of/protect► me all during the night.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>There may be thousands of enemy soldiers who surround me,</p><p>but I am not afraid.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Yahweh, arise!</p><p>My God, come and rescue me again!</p><p>You insult my enemies by slapping them on their cheeks;</p><p>
    when you strike them, you break their teeth,</p><p>
    with the result that they cannot hurt anyone [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Yahweh, you are the one who saves your people from their enemies.</p><p>Yahweh, bless your people!</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-4"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-4">4</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David for the choir director; a psalm to be accompanied by people playing stringed instruments</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>God, answer me when I pray to you.</p><p>You are the one who vindicates me;</p><p>Rescue me from things that distress me.</p><p>Act mercifully toward me, and listen to me while I pray.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>How long will you people cause me to be disgraced instead of honoring me [RHQ]?</p><p>You people love to falsely accuse me.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>All those who are loyal to Yahweh,</p><p>he has chosen them to belong to him.</p><p>Yahweh listens to me when I pray to him.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>When you people get angry, do not allow your anger to control you and cause you to sin.</p><p>While you lie on your bed,</p><p>silently examine what you are thinking.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Also, offer to Yahweh the proper sacrifices,</p><p>and continue trusting in him.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Some people ask, “Who will allow good things to happen to us?”</p><p>
    But I say, “Yahweh, continue to act kindly toward us.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>You have made me very happy;</p><p>I am happier than people who have harvested a great amount of grain and grapes.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>I can lie down at night and sleep soundly</p><p>because I know that you, Yahweh, will keep me safe.”</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-5"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-5">5</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David for the choir director; a psalm to be accompanied by playing flutes</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh, listen to me while I pray!</p><p>Pay attention to me when I am groaning because I am suffering very much.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>You are my King and my God.</p><p>When I call to you to ask you to help me, listen to me,</p><p>because you are the one to whom I pray.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Listen to me when I pray to you each morning,</p><p>and I wait for you to reply.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>You are not a god who is pleased with wicked people;</p><p>you do not ◄associate with/invite into your house► those who do what is evil.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>You do not allow those who are very proud to come to you to worship you.</p><p>You hate all those who do evil things.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>You get rid of liars,</p><p>and you despise those who murder others and those who deceive others.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Yahweh, because you love me so much and so faithfully,</p><p>I come into your temple.</p><p>I revere you greatly,</p><p>and I bow down to worship you at your sacred temple.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Yahweh, because you act righteously toward me,</p><p>show me what is right for me to do.</p><p>Because I have many enemies,</p><p>show me clearly what you want me to do.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>My enemies never say what is true;</p><p>they just want to destroy others.</p><p>The things that they say [MTY] are as foul as an open grave where a corpse is decaying.</p><p>They use their tongues to tell lies.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>O God, declare that they are guilty [MTY] and punish them.</p><p>Cause them to experience the same disasters/troubles that they plan to cause to happen to others.</p><p>Get rid of them because they have committed many sins,</p><p>and they have rebelled against you.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>But cause that all those who go to you to be protected will rejoice;</p><p>cause them to sing joyfully to you forever.</p><p>Protect those who love you [MTY];</p><p>they are truly happy because ◄of what you do for them/they belong to you►.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Yahweh, you always bless those who act righteously;</p><p>you protect them like a soldier is protected by his shield [SIM].</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-6"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-6">6</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David for the choir leader, to be accompanied by people playing stringed instruments</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh, do not punish me when you are angry with me;</p><p>Do not even rebuke/scold me when you are angry.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Yahweh, be kind to me and heal me because I have become weak.</p><p>My body [SYN] shakes because I am experiencing much pain.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Yahweh, I am greatly distressed.</p><p>How long ◄must I endure this/will it be before you help me► [RHQ]?</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Yahweh, please come and rescue me.</p><p>Save me because you faithfully love me.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>I will not be able to praise you after I die [RHQ];</p><p>No one in the place of the dead praises you.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>I am exhausted/groan from my pain.</p><p>At night I cry very much, with the result that my bed and my pillow become wet from my tears.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>My tears blur my eyes so much that I cannot see well.</p><p>My eyes have become weak because my enemies have caused me to cry constantly.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>You people who do evil things, get away from me!</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Yahweh heard me when I was crying and called out to him to help me,</p><p>and he will answer my prayer.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    When that happens, all my enemies will be ashamed,</p><p>and they will also be terrified.</p><p>They will get away from me and suddenly leave me</p><p>because they will be disgraced.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-7"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-7">7</h3></a>
<p>A psalm that David sang to Yahweh because of David’s enemy, Cush</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh my God, I come to you to protect me.</p><p>Rescue me, save me from all those who are pursuing me in order to harm me.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>If you do not do that, they will tear me into pieces</p><p>like a lion does when it attacks the animals it wants to kill,</p><p>and no one will save me from them.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Yahweh my God, if I have done anything that is wrong,</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>if I have done evil to some friend who did good things to me,</p><p>or if, for no good reason, I have spared (OR, acted violently toward) those who were my enemies,</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>allow my enemies to pursue me and capture me.</p><p>Allow them to trample me into the ground</p><p>and leave me [SYN] lying dead in the dirt.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>But Yahweh, because you are very angry with those who pursue me,</p><p>arise and attack/defeat my enemies who are furiously/angrily attacking me</p><p>Do to them what is just!</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Gather around you the people of all nations,</p><p>and rule them from where you are in heaven [MTY].</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Yahweh, judge the people of all nations!</p><p>And, Yahweh, show that I have done nothing that is wrong.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>God, you know what every person is thinking,</p><p>and because you are righteous, you always do what is just/right.</p><p>
    So now stop evil people from doing wicked deeds,</p><p>and defend all of us who are righteous!</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>God, you protect me like a shield protects soldiers [MET];</p><p>you protect all those who are righteous in their inner being.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>You judge everyone correctly,</p><p>and every day you punish wicked people.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Whenever your enemies do not ◄repent/change their behavior►,</p><p>
    it is as though [MET] you sharpen your sword and put a string on your bow to get ready to kill them.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>You are preparing your weapons that kill those whom they strike;</p><p>the arrows that you will shoot have flaming tips.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>Wicked people tell lies,</p><p>and they think that they surely will be able to do [MET] the evil things that they are planning to do</p><p>
    just as surely as a pregnant woman knows that she is going to give birth to a child [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>But when they dig a deep pit to trap others,</p><p>they themselves will fall into it.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>They themselves will experience the trouble that they want to cause others to have;</p><p>they will hurt themselves by the violent things that they want to do to others.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>I praise Yahweh because he always acts righteously/justly;</p><p>I sing to praise Yahweh, the one who is much greater than any other god.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-8"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-8">8</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David for the choir director, to be accompanied by a stringed instrument</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh, our Lord, people all over the world know that you [MTY] are very great!</p><p>Your glory reaches up higher than the heavens!</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>You have taught little children and infants to praise you;</p><p>they cause your enemies and those who try to ◄get revenge on/get rid of► you to be silent.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>When I look up at the sky at night,</p><p>and see the things that you have made—</p><p>the moon and the stars that you have set in place—</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>it is amazing to me that [RHQ] you think about people,</p><p>that you are concerned about us humans!</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>You made the angels in heaven to be only a little more important than we are;</p><p>you caused us to be like kings [MET] and you gave us splendor and honor [DOU]!</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>You put us in charge of everything that you made;</p><p>you gave us authority over all things—</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>the sheep and the cattle,</p><p>and even the wild animals,</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>the birds, the fish,</p><p>and everything else that swims in the seas.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Yahweh, our Lord,</p><p>people all over the world know that you [MTY] are very great!</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-9"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-9">9</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David for the choir director, to be sung using the tune ‘The death of my son’</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh, I will praise you with all of my inner being.</p><p>I will tell others about all the wonderful things that you have done.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>I will sing to celebrate what you [MTY], who are much greater than all other gods, have done.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>When my enemies realize that you are very powerful,</p><p>they stumble, and then they are killed.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>You sat on your throne to judge people,</p><p>and you have judged fairly/justly concerning me.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>You rebuked the people of other nations</p><p>and you have gotten rid of the wicked people;</p><p>you have erased their names forever.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Our enemies have disappeared;</p><p>you destroyed their cities,</p><p>and people do not even remember them any more.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>But Yahweh rules forever.</p><p>He judges people while he sits on his throne to judge people,</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>and he will judge all the people in [SYN] the world justly;</p><p>he will judge the people of all nations fairly [DOU].</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Yahweh will be a refuge for those who are oppressed;</p><p>
    yes, he will be like a shelter for them when they have trouble.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Those who know Yahweh [MTY] trust in him;</p><p>he never abandons those who come to him ◄for help/to worship him►.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Yahweh rules from Zion Hill;</p><p>praise him while you sing to him.</p><p>Tell the people of all the nations the marvelous things that he has done.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>He does not forget to punish those who have murdered others;</p><p>and he will not ignore people who are crying because they are suffering.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Yahweh, be merciful to me!</p><p>Look at the ways that my enemies have injured me.</p><p>Do not allow me to die because of these injuries.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>I want to live in order that I can praise you at the gates of Jerusalem [MTY]</p><p>and to rejoice because you rescued me.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    It is as though the wicked people of many nations have dug a pit for me to fall into [MET],</p><p>but they have fallen into that same pit.</p><p>
    It is as if they spread out a net to catch me [MET],</p><p>but their feet have been caught in that same net.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>Because of what you have done, people know that you decide matters fairly/justly,</p><p>but you allow wicked people to be trapped by the same evil things that they themselves do.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Wicked people will all die and be buried in their graves,</p><p>and their spirits will go to be with all those who have ◄forgotten about/rejected► you.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>But you will not forget those who are needy/poor;</p><p>what they confidently expect will certainly happen.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Yahweh, arise and judge the wicked people of the nations;</p><p>do not allow them to think that because they are strong they will never be punished.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>Yahweh, teach them to be terrified about you.</p><p>Cause them to know that they are merely human beings.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-10"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-10">10</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh, ◄why are you far away from us?/it seems that you are far away from us.► [RHQ]</p><p>Why do you not pay attention when we have troubles [RHQ]?</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>People who are proud gladly cause poor people to suffer.</p><p>So cause what they do to others to happen to them! May they be caught in the same traps that they set to catch others [MET]!</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>They brag about the evil things that they want to do.</p><p>They praise people who seize from others things that do not belong to them, and they curse you, Yahweh.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Wicked people are very proud.</p><p>As a result, they do not ◄seek help from/are not concerned about► God;</p><p>they do not even think that God exists.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>But it seems that they succeed in everything that they do.</p><p>They do not think that they will be condemned/punished for their deeds,</p><p>and they ◄sneer at/make fun of► their enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>They think, “Nothing bad will happen to us!</p><p>We will never have troubles!”</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>When they talk [MTY], they are always cursing, lying, and threatening to harm others.</p><p>They constantly say [MTY] evil things that show that they are ready to do cruel things to others.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>They hide in villages, ready to ◄ambush/suddenly attack► and kill people who ◄are innocent/have done nothing wrong►.</p><p>They constantly search for people who will not be able to ◄resist/defend themselves► when they are attacked.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>They are like [MET] lions that crouch down and hide,</p><p>waiting to pounce on their prey.</p><p>They are like hunters that catch their prey with a net and then drag it away.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Just like helpless animals are crushed,</p><p>people who cannot defend themselves are killed because wicked people are very strong.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Wicked people say, “God will not pay any attention to what we do.</p><p>His eyes are covered, so he never sees anything.”</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Yahweh God, arise and help us</p><p>Punish [IDM] those wicked people!</p><p>And do not forget those who are suffering!</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Wicked people revile you [RHQ] continually.</p><p>They think, “God will never punish us!”</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>But you see the trouble and the distress that they cause.</p><p>People who are suffering expect that you will help them;</p><p>and you help orphans, also.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>◄Break the arms/Destroy the power► of wicked [DOU] people!</p><p>Continue to pursue and punish them for the wicked things that they do, until they stop doing those things.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>Yahweh, you are our king forever,</p><p>but wicked nations will disappear from the earth.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>You have listened to afflicted/suffering people when they cry out to you.</p><p>You hear them when they pray, and you encourage [IDM] them.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>You show that orphans and oppressed people have not done things that are wrong,</p><p>with the result that human beings will not cause people to be terrified any more.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-11"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-11">11</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David for the choir director</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>I trust that Yahweh will protect [MTY] me.</p><p>So do not [RHQ] say to me, “You need to escape/flee to the mountains like birds do,</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>because wicked people have hidden in the darkness,</p><p>they have pulled back their bowstrings and aimed their arrows</p><p>to shoot them at godly/righteous [IDM] people like you.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>When people are not punished for disobeying the laws,</p><p>◄what can righteous people do?/there is not much that righteous people can do.►” [RHQ]</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>But Yahweh is sitting on his throne in his sacred temple in heaven,</p><p>and he [SYN] watches everything that people do.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Yahweh examines what righteous people do and what wicked people do,</p><p>and he hates those who like to perform violent actions to injure others.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>He will send down from the sky flaming coals and burning sulfur,</p><p>and send scorching hot winds to punish wicked people.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Yahweh is righteous and he loves those who act righteously;</p><p>righteous people are able to come into his presence.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-12"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-12">12</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David for the choir director</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh, help us!</p><p>
    It seems that people who are loyal to you have all vanished.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Everyone tells lies to other people;</p><p>they deceive others by ◄flattering them/saying good things about them that they know are not true►.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Yahweh, we wish that you would cut off their tongues</p><p>so that they cannot continue to boast.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>They say, “By telling lies we will get what we want;</p><p>we control what we say [MTY], so no one can tell us what we should not do!”</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>But Yahweh replies, “I have seen the violent things that they have done to helpless people;</p><p>and I have heard those people groaning,</p><p>so I will arise and rescue the people who are wanting me to help them.”</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Yahweh, you always do what you have promised to do;</p><p>what you have promised is as precious and pure as silver</p><p>that has been heated seven times in a furnace to get rid of all the impure material.</p><p>
    <sup>7-8</sup>Wicked people strut around proudly,</p><p>and people praise them for doing vile/wicked deeds,</p><p>but Yahweh, we know that you will protect/rescue us</p><p>from those wicked people.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-13"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-13">13</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David for the choir director</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh, how long will you continue to forget about me [RHQ]?</p><p>Will you hide yourself [SYN] from me forever?</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>How long must I endure anguish/worry?</p><p>Must I be miserable/sad every day?</p><p>How long will my enemies continue to defeat me?</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Yahweh my God, look at me and answer me.</p><p>Enable me to become strong again [IDM], and do not allow me to die.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Do not allow my enemies to boast saying, “We have defeated him!”</p><p>Do not allow them to defeat me,</p><p>with the result that they will rejoice about it!</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>But I trust that you will faithfully love me;</p><p>I will rejoice when you rescue me.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Yahweh, you have done many good things for me,</p><p>so I will sing to you.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-14"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-14">14</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David for the choir director</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Only foolish people say to themselves, “There is no God!”</p><p>People who say those things are corrupt/worthless; they do abominable/detestable deeds;</p><p>there is not one of them who does what is good/right.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Yahweh looks down from heaven and sees humans;</p><p>he looks to see if anyone is very wise,</p><p>with the result that he desires to know God.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>But they are all corrupt/evil;</p><p>no one does what is good/right.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Will those evil people never learn what God will do to punish them [RHQ]?</p><p>They act violently toward Yahweh’s people while eating the food that he provides,</p><p>and they never pray to Yahweh.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>But some day they will become very terrified</p><p>because God helps those who act righteously and will punish those who reject him.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Those who do evil may prevent helpless people from doing what they plan to do,</p><p>but Yahweh protects those helpless people [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>I wish/desire that Yahweh would come from Jerusalem [MTY] and rescue us Israeli people!</p><p>Yahweh, when you bless your people again,</p><p>all of us Israeli people, who are the descendants of Jacob, will rejoice.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-15"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-15">15</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh, who are allowed to enter your Sacred Tent?</p><p>Who are allowed to live on your sacred mountain?</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Only those who always do what is right and do not sin may do that.</p><p>They always say what is true</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>and they do not slander others.</p><p>They do not do to others things that are wrong,</p><p>and they do not say bad things about others.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    Godly people hate those whom God has rejected,</p><p>but they respect those who revere Yahweh.</p><p>They do what they have promised to do</p><p>even if it causes them trouble to do that.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>They lend money to others without charging interest,</p><p>and they never accept bribes in order to lie about people who have not done what is wrong.</p><p>Those who do those things will never stop trusting God even if disastrous things happen to them.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-16"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-16">16</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>God, protect me</p><p>because I go to you to keep me safe!</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>I said to Yahweh, “You are my Lord;</p><p>all the good things that I have come from you.”</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Your people who live in this land are wonderful;</p><p>I delight to be with them.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Those who choose to worship other gods will have many things that cause them to be sad.</p><p>I will not join them when they make sacrifices to their gods;</p><p>I will not even join them when they speak [MTY] the names of their gods.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Yahweh, you are the one whom I have chosen,</p><p>and you give me great blessings.</p><p>You protect me and control what happens to me.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Yahweh has given me a wonderful place in which to live;</p><p>I am delighted with all the things that he has given me [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>I will praise Yahweh, the one who teaches/disciplines me;</p><p>even at night he you put in my mind what is right for me to do.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>I know that Yahweh is always with me.</p><p>He is beside me;</p><p>so nothing will ◄perturb me/cause me to be worried►.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Therefore I am glad and I [MTY, DOU] rejoice;</p><p>I can rest securely</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>because you, Yahweh, will not allow my soul/spirit to remain in the place where the dead people are;</p><p>you will not allow me, your godly one, to stay there.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>You will show me the road that leads to receiving eternal life,</p><p>and you will make me joyful when I am with you.</p><p>I will have pleasure forever when I am ◄at your right hand/seated next to you►.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-17"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-17">17</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh, listen to me while I plead with you to act justly toward me.</p><p>Hear me while I call out to you to help me.</p><p>Pay attention to what I say while I pray</p><p>because I am speaking [MTY] honestly/truthfully.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>You are the one who is able to declare that I ◄am innocent/have not done anything that was wrong►</p><p>because you see/know that I am telling the truth.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>You know what I think, even at night;</p><p>you have examined what I say and do,</p><p>and you know that I have determined to never tell any lies.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>I have not done like others do;</p><p>I have always done what is right [IDM],</p><p>and I have not acted cruelly toward others.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>I have always done what you told me to do [IDM],</p><p>I have ◄never failed to do/always done► [LIT] those things.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>O God, I pray to you because you answer me;</p><p>please listen [MTY] to what I am saying.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Show me that you faithfully love me.</p><p>By your great power [MTY] rescue those who ◄run to/trust in► you to protect them from their enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Protect me as people carefully protect their own eyes;</p><p>protect me like birds protect their babies under their wings [MET].</p><p>

    <sup>10</sup>They never pity [IDM] anyone,</p><p>and they are always boasting.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>They have hunted/searched for me and found me.</p><p>They surround me, watching for an opportunity to throw me to the ground.</p><p>

    <sup>15</sup>Yahweh, because I act righteously, I will some day see you [SYN].</p><p>When I awake, I will see you face-to-face, and then I will be happy.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-18"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-18">18</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by God’s servant David. He sang it after Yahweh had rescued him from Saul and his other enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh, I love you, the one who enables me to be strong.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Yahweh is like an overhanging rock [DOU, MET] under which I can hide from my enemies;</p><p>he is like a strong fortress, the one who protects me;</p><p>he protects me like a shield [MET] protects a soldier;</p><p>he is the one to whom I go ◄for refuge/to be protected/safe►,</p><p>and he defends me by his great power [IDM].</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>I called out to Yahweh, who deserves to be praised,</p><p>and he rescued me from my enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>All around me were dangerous situations in which I might be killed [PRS];</p><p>it was as though there were huge waves [MET] that almost crashed on me and killed me.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    It was as though the place where dead people are had ropes that were wrapped around me,</p><p>or it was as though there was a trap [MET] that would seize and kill me.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>But when I was very distressed, I called out to Yahweh,</p><p>and from his temple he heard me.</p><p>He listened to me when I cried out for help.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Then the earth quaked/shook strongly [DOU];</p><p>the mountains shook very strongly from their centers [DOU]</p><p>because Yahweh was angry.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    It was as though smoke poured out from his nostrils,</p><p>and as though burning coals came out of his mouth.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>He opened the sky and came down</p><p>with a black cloud under his feet.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>He flew, riding on the back of a creature that had wings,</p><p>traveling fast, blown along by the wind.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Darkness was all around him like a blanket [MET];</p><p>dark clouds, full of moisture, covered him [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Hailstones and flashes of lightning were around him;</p><p>hail and burning coals fell from the sky.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Then Yahweh spoke in a loud voice from the sky,</p><p>and his enemies heard his voice that sounded like thunder.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>He shot his arrows at them and caused them to scatter;</p><p>His flashes of lightning caused them to become very confused (OR, to run away).</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>The bottom of the ocean became visible,</p><p>and the foundations of the earth were uncovered,</p><p>when Yahweh rebuked his enemies</p><p>when he snorted.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    It was as though he reached down from heaven and grabbed me</p><p>and pulled me up out of the deep ocean.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>He rescued me from my strong enemies who hated me;</p><p>they were very strong,</p><p>with the result that I could not defeat them.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>When I ◄was distressed/had troubles►, they attacked me,</p><p>but Yahweh defended/protected me.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>He led me to a place where I was safe;</p><p>he rescued me because he was pleased with me.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>Yahweh has rewarded me because I do what is right;</p><p>he has blessed me because I ◄am innocent/have not done things that are wrong►.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>I have obeyed Yahweh’s laws;</p><p>I have not abandoned him.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>My behavior was directed by his rules;</p><p>I have not stopped obeying them.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>He knows that I have not done what is wrong;</p><p>I have kept myself from sinning.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>So he rewards me because I do what is right;</p><p>he knows that I [SYN] have not committed sins.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>Yahweh, you are faithful to those who faithfully do what you tell them to do;</p><p>you always do what is good/right to those who do what you want them to do.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>You are kind to those who are kind to others,</p><p>but you act wisely toward those who ◄act perversely/do bad things►.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>You save those who are humble,</p><p>but you cause those who are proud to be humiliated/ashamed.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>You give light to my soul/spirit;</p><p>you take away the darkness of my soul.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>You enable me to be strong,</p><p>with the result that I can run and attack a line of enemy soldiers;</p><p>with your help I can ◄scale/climb up► the walls that surround my enemies’ cities.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>Everything that Yahweh my God does is perfect.</p><p>We can depend on him to do what he promises.</p><p>He is like a shield [MET] to protect all those who go to him for refuge.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>Yahweh is [RHQ] the only one who is God;</p><p>only he is like an overhanging rock under which we can be safe.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>God is the one who enables me to be strong</p><p>and who keeps me safe on the roads that I walk on.</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>He enables me to walk swiftly without stumbling,</p><p>like a deer walks/runs in the mountains.</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>He teaches me how to use a strong/metal bow</p><p>in order that I can use it to fight in battles.</p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>Yahweh, you protect and save me with your shield;</p><p>you have made me safe by your power [MTY].</p><p>I have become ◄strong/a great king► because you have helped me.</p><p>
    <sup>36</sup>You have cleared the road for me,</p><p>with the result that now I do not slip/stumble.</p><p>
    <sup>37</sup>I have pursued my enemies and caught them;</p><p>I did not stop until I had defeated/killed them all.</p><p>
    <sup>38</sup>When I strike them, they are not able to get up again;</p><p>they lie on the ground, defeated.</p><p>
    <sup>39</sup>You have enabled me to be strong</p><p>in order that I can fight battles and defeat my enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>40</sup>You caused my enemies to run away (OR, you enabled me to put my foot on my enemies’ necks after I captured them and forced them to lie on the ground);</p><p>I have gotten rid of all those who hated me.</p><p>
    <sup>41</sup>They called out for someone to help them,</p><p>but no one saved them.</p><p>
    <sup>42</sup>I pulverize them,</p><p>with the result that they become like [MET] the dust that the wind blows away;</p><p>I throw them out like [SIM] people throw dirt out into the streets.</p><p>
    <sup>43</sup>You enabled me to defeat those who fought against me,</p><p>and appointed me to be the ruler of many nations;</p><p>people whom I did not know about previously are now slaves in my kingdom.</p><p>
    <sup>44</sup>When foreigners hear about me,</p><p>they ◄cringe/bow low before me► and they obey me.</p><p>
    <sup>45</sup>They are no longer courageous,</p><p>and from their forts where they were hiding they come to me trembling.</p><p>
    <sup>46</sup>Yahweh is alive!</p><p>Praise the one who is like an overhanging rock [MET] under which I am safe</p><p>Exalt the God who saves me!</p><p>
    <sup>47</sup>He enables me to get revenge on my enemies;</p><p>he causes me to defeat nations and to rule over them,</p><p>
    <sup>48</sup>and he rescues me from my enemies.</p><p>He has lifted me up high so that violent men could not reach me and harm me.</p><p>
    <sup>49</sup>So I praise him and I tell the nations the great things that he has done.</p><p>
    <sup>50</sup>He has enabled me, his king, to powerfully defeat my enemies;</p><p>he faithfully loves me, David, the one he has chosen to be king, and he will faithfully love my descendants forever.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-19"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-19">19</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David for the choir director</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    When people look at everything that God has placed in the skies, they can see that he is very great;</p><p>they can see the great things that he has created.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Day after day it is as though the sun proclaims the glory of God,</p><p>and night after night it is as though the moon and stars say that they know that God made them.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>They do not really speak;</p><p>they do not say any words.</p><p>There is no voice from them for anyone to hear.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>But what they declare about God goes throughout the world,</p><p>and even people who live in the most distant/remote places on earth can know it.</p><p>The sun is in the skies where God placed it [MET];</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>it rises each morning like a bridegroom who is happy as he comes out of his bedroom after his wedding.</p><p>It is like a strong athlete who is very eager to start running in a race.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>The sun rises at one side of the sky and goes across the sky and sets on the other side,</p><p>and nothing can hide from its heat.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>The instructions that Yahweh has given us are perfect;</p><p>they ◄revive us/give us new strength►.</p><p>We can be sure that the things that Yahweh has told us will never change,</p><p>and by learning them people who have not been previously taught/instructed will become wise.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Yahweh’s laws are fair/just;</p><p>
    when we obey them, we become joyful.</p><p>The commands of Yahweh are clear,</p><p>and by reading them [PRS] we start to understand how God wants us to behave.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>It is good for people to revere Yahweh;</p><p>that is something that they will do forever.</p><p>What Yahweh has decided is fair,</p><p>and it is always right.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>The things that God has decided are more valuable than gold,</p><p>even the finest/purest gold.</p><p>They are sweeter than honey</p><p>that drips from honeycombs.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Furthermore, by reading them I learn what things are good to do and what things are evil,</p><p>and they promise a great reward</p><p>to us who obey them.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>But there is no one who can know all his errors [RHQ];</p><p>so Yahweh, forgive me for these things which I do that I do not realize are wrong.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Keep me from doing things that I know are wrong;</p><p>do not let my sinful desires control me.</p><p>If you do that, I will no longer be guilty for committing such sins,</p><p>and I will not commit the great sin of rebelling terribly against you.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>O Yahweh, you are like an overhanging rock [MET] under which I can be safe; you are the one who protects me.</p><p>I hope/desire that the things that I say and what I think will always please you.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-20"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-20">20</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David for the choir director</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>I desire that Yahweh will answer you when you call out to him when you have troubles!</p><p>God is the one whom ◄our ancestor Jacob/the Israeli people► worshiped;</p><p>I desire that he will protect you [MTY] from being harmed by your enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>I desire/hope that he will reach out from his sacred temple and help you,</p><p>and aid you from where he lives on Zion Hill.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>I desire/hope that he will accept all the offerings that you give him to be burned on the altar,</p><p>and all your other offerings.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>I want him to give to you what you desire,</p><p>and that you will be able to accomplish all that you desire to do.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>When we hear that you have defeated your enemies, we will shout joyfully.</p><p>We will lift up a banner proclaiming that it is God [MTY] who helps us (inc).</p><p>I want Yahweh to do for you all that you request him to do.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>I know now that Yahweh rescues me, the one whom he has chosen to be king.</p><p>From his holy place in heaven he will answer me,</p><p>and he will save me by his great power [MTY].</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Some kings trust that because they have chariots they will be able to defeat their enemies,</p><p>and some trust that their horses will enable them to defeat their enemies,</p><p>but we will trust in the power [MTY] of Yahweh our God.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Some kings will stumble and fall down,</p><p>but we will be strong and ◄not be moved/continue standing firm►.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Yahweh, enable me, your king, to defeat our enemies!</p><p>Answer us when we call out to you to help us.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-21"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-21">21</h3></a>

    <sup>3</sup>In answer to my/his prayer, you enabled me/him to succeed and prosper.</p><p>You placed a gold crown on my/his head.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>I/He asked you to enable me/him to live for a long time,</p><p>and that is what you gave me/him, a very long [HYP] life.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>◄I am/He is► greatly honored because you have helped me/him to defeat my/his enemies;</p><p>you have made me/him famous.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>You will bless me/him forever,</p><p>and you have caused me/him to be joyful in your presence.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Yahweh, you are God Almighty,</p><p>and ◄I trust/the king trusts► in you.</p><p>Because you faithfully love me/him,</p><p>disastrous things will never happen to me/him.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>You will enable me/him to capture [MTY] all my/his enemies</p><p>and all those who hate me/him.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>When you appear, you will throw them into a fiery furnace.</p><p>Because you are angry with them, you will get rid of them;</p><p>the fire will burn them up.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>You will remove their children from this earth;</p><p>their descendants will all disappear.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>They planned to harm you,</p><p>but what they plan will never succeed.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>You will cause them to run away [IDM]</p><p>by shooting arrows at them.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Yahweh, show us that you are very strong!</p><p>When you do that, while we sing we will praise you because you are very powerful.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-22"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-22">22</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David for the choir director, to be sung to the tune ‘Doe of the Dawn’</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>My God, my God, why have you abandoned/deserted me?</p><p>Why do you stay so far from me,</p><p>and why do you not hear/help me [RHQ]?</p><p>Why do you not hear me when I am groaning?</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>My God, every day I call to you during the daytime and during the night,</p><p>but you do not answer me, so I am not able to sleep.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>But you are holy.</p><p>You sit on your throne as king, and we the people of Israel praise you [PRS].</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Our ancestors trusted in you.</p><p>
    Because they trusted in you, you rescued them.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>When they cried out to you, you saved them.</p><p>They trusted in you, and ◄they were not disappointed/you saved them as you said that you would►.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>But you have not rescued me</p><p>
    People despise me and consider that I am not a man;</p><p>
    they think that I am as worthless as a worm!</p><p>Everyone [HYP] scorns me and despises me.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Everyone who sees me [HYP] makes fun of me.</p><p>They sneer at me and insult me by shaking their heads at me as though I were an evil man.</p><p>They say,</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>“He trusts in Yahweh,</p><p>so Yahweh should save him!</p><p>
    He says that Yahweh is very pleased with him;</p><p>if that is so, Yahweh should rescue him!”</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    Why do you not protect me now as you did when I was born?</p><p>I was safe even when I was ◄nursing/drinking milk from my mother’s breasts►.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    It was as though you adopted me right when I was born.</p><p>You have ◄been my God/taken care of me► ever since I was born.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>So, ◄do not stay far from/stay close to► [LIT] me now</p><p>because enemies who will cause me much trouble are near me,</p><p>and there is no one else who can help me.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    My enemies surround me like a herd/group of wild bulls.</p><p>
    Fierce people, like those strong bulls that graze on the hills in Bashan area, encircle me.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    They are like roaring lions that are attacking the animals that they want to kill [MET] and eat;</p><p>they rush toward me to kill me;</p><p>they are like lions that have their mouths open, ready to tear their victims to pieces [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>I am completely exhausted [MET],</p><p>and all my bones are out of their joints/places.</p><p>I no longer expect that God will save me;</p><p>
    that expectation is gone completely, like wax that has melted away.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>My strength is all dried up [MET]</p><p>like a broken piece of a clay jar that has dried in the sun.</p><p>
    I am so thirsty that my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth.</p><p>O God, I think that you are about to let me die and become dirt!</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>My enemies [MET] surround me like a pack/group of wild dogs.</p><p>A group of evil men has encircled me, ready to attack me.</p><p>They have already smashed my hands and my feet.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    I am so weak and thin that my bones can be seen and counted.</p><p>My enemies stare at me and ◄gloat/are happy► about what has happened to me.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>They looked at the clothes that I was wearing</p><p>and gambled to determine which piece each of them would get.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>O Yahweh, do not stay far away from me!</p><p>You who are my source of strength,</p><p>come quickly and help me!</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>Rescue me from those who want to kill me with their swords.</p><p>Save me from those who are like wild/fierce dogs [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>Snatch me away from my enemies who are like lions whose jaws are already open, ready to chew me up</p><p>Grab me away from those men who are like wild oxen that attack other animals with their horns [MET]!</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    But you have saved me, so  I will declare to my fellow Israelis how great you [MTY] are.</p><p>I will praise you among the group of your people gathered togetherto worship you.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>You people who have an awesome respect for Yahweh, praise him!</p><p>All you who are descended from Jacob, honor Yahweh!</p><p>All you Israeli people, revere him!</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>He does not despise or ignore those who are suffering;</p><p>he does not hide ◄his face/himself► from them.</p><p>He has listened to them when they cried out to him for help.</p><p>

    <sup>10</sup>I have become very weak because I am so miserable,</p><p>and it is causing my life to become shorter.</p><p>I have become weak because of all my troubles;</p><p>even my bones are becoming weaker.</p><p>

    <sup>19</sup>You have stored up many blessings for those who revere you.</p><p>You do those good things for those who go to you to be protected;</p><p>everyone sees you doing that.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>You hide people in your presence where it is safe,</p><p>and protect them from people who plot to kill them.</p><p>You hide them in safe places from their enemies [MTY] who accuse/insult them.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>Praise Yahweh!</p><p>When my enemies surrounded the city in which I was living,</p><p>he showed me in a wonderful way that he faithfully loves me.</p><p>

    <sup>3</sup>When I did not confess my sins,</p><p>◄my body/I► was very weak and sick,</p><p>and I groaned ◄all day long/continually►.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Day and night, Yahweh, you [SYN] punished me severely.</p><p>My strength drained away like water that ◄evaporates/dries up► on a hot summer day.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>

    <sup>7</sup>He gathered all the water into one huge mass</p><p>like someone scoops liquid into a container.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Everyone on the earth should revere Yahweh [DOU].</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>When he spoke, the world ◄was created/started to exist►.</p><p>Everything started to exist as a result of him commanding it.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Yahweh frustrates the things that the pagan nations decide to do.</p><p>He prevents them from doing the evil things that they plan to do.</p><p>

    <sup>12</sup>Yahweh blesses those nations who choose him to be their God;</p><p>He is pleased with those whom he has chosen to receive what he has promised.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Yahweh looks down from heaven and sees all us people;</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>from where he rules [MTY], he looks down on all the people who live on the earth.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>He formed our inner beings,</p><p>and he sees everything that we do.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>It is not because a king has a great army that he is able to win battles,</p><p>and it is not because a soldier is very strong that he is able to defeat his enemy.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>It is foolish to trust that because horses are very strong</p><p>that they will able to win a battle and save their riders.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>Do not forget that Yahweh watches over those who revere him,</p><p>those who confidently expect him to faithfully love them.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>He saves them [SYN] from dying before they should die</p><p>and preserves them when there is a famine.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>We trust that Yahweh will help us;</p><p>he protects us like a shield protects a soldier [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>We rejoice because of what he has done for us;</p><p>we trust in him because he [MTY] is holy.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>Yahweh, we pray that you will always faithfully love us</p><p>while we confidently expect you to do great things for us.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-34"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-34">34</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David when he pretended to be insane in front of King Abimelech, so that the king would send him away</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>I will always thank Yahweh;</p><p>I will constantly praise him [MTY].</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>I will boast about what Yahweh has done.</p><p>All those who are oppressed/discouraged should hear me and rejoice.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Join with me in telling others that Yahweh is great!</p><p>You and I should together proclaim how glorious he is!</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>I prayed to Yahweh, and he ◄answered my prayer/did what I asked him to do►;</p><p>he rescued me from all those who caused me to be afraid.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Those who trust [IDM] that he will help them will be joyful;</p><p>◄they will never be disappointed/he will always do for them the things that he promises► [LIT].</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>I was miserable/helpless, but I called out to Yahweh, and he heard me.</p><p>He rescued me from all my troubles.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>An angel from Yahweh guards those who revere him,</p><p>and the angel rescues them.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Find out for yourself, and you will experience that Yahweh is good to you!</p><p>He is very pleased with those who ask him to protect them.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>All you who belong to him, revere him!</p><p>Those who do that will always have the things that they need [LIT].</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Lions are usually very strong, but sometimes even young lions are hungry and become weak,</p><p>but those who trust in Yahweh will ◄have everything/not lack any good thing► [LIT] that they need.</p><p>

    <sup>14</sup>Turn away from doing evil, and do what is good!</p><p>Always try hard to enable people to live peacefully with each other.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>Yahweh [MTY] carefully watches over those who act righteously;</p><p>he always responds [MTY] to them when they call to him for help.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>But Yahweh [SYN] ◄is opposed to/turns away from► those who do what is evil.</p><p>
    And after they die, people will forget them completely.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Yahweh hears righteous people when they call out to him;</p><p>he rescues them from all their troubles.</p><p>

<p>A psalm written by David</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh, fight against those who fight against me!</p><p>Fight against my enemies when they fight me!</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Be like a shield [DOU] to protect me</p><p>and come to help me!</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Lift up your spear [DOU] and throw it at those who pursue me!</p><p>Promise me that you will enable me to defeat my enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Cause those who are trying to kill me to be defeated and disgraced!</p><p>Cause those who are planning to do evil things to me to be pushed back and become confused!</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Send your angel to pursue them,</p><p>and as a result cause them to disappear like chaff/straw blown away by the wind!</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Cause the path on which they run to be dark and slippery</p><p>as your angel pursues them!</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Although I did not do anything wrong to them,</p><p>they concealed a deep pit for me to fall into;</p><p>they hid a net in which they would catch me.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Cause them to suddenly experience disaster!</p><p>Cause them to be trapped in their own nets!</p><p>Cause them to fall into the pits that they have dug for me and disappear!</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Then I will be joyful about what you, Yahweh, have done for me,</p><p>I will be glad that you have rescued me.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>With my whole inner being [SYN] I will say,</p><p>“There is no one like Yahweh [RHQ]!</p><p>No one else can rescue helpless people from powerful people [RHQ].</p><p>No one else can rescue weak and needy people from those who want to rob them.”</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>People who tell lies stand in court</p><p>and falsely accuse me of doing things that I do not know anything about.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>In return for my doing good things for them, they do evil things to me,</p><p>with the result that I feel that I am alone.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>When they were ill, I showed that I was sad.</p><p>I did not eat any food, and I bowed my head as I prayed for them.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>I mourned and bowed my head as I prayed</p><p>as though it was a friend or my mother for whom I was grieving.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>But when I had troubles, they were all happy about it.</p><p>They gathered around to make fun of me.</p><p>Strangers struck me,</p><p>and they would not stop.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>Worthless people ridicule me</p><p>and snarl at me.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Yahweh, how long will you only watch them doing this?</p><p>Rescue me from their attacking me;</p><p>Save me from being killed by these men who are attacking me</p><p>like [MET] lions that are attacking other animals</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>Then, when many of your people gather,</p><p>I will praise you</p><p>and I will thank you in front of all of them.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Do not allow my enemies, who tell lies about me, defeat me</p><p>and then rejoice!</p><p>Do not allow those who hate me when there in no reason to hate me</p><p>to ◄smirk/smile happily►!</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>They do not talk peacefully to people;</p><p>instead, they seek ways to tell lies about people who are peaceful.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>They shout at me, to accuse me,</p><p>saying, “We saw the wrong things that you did!”</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>Yahweh, you have seen these things, so do not be silent!</p><p>Do not stay far from me!</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>Arise, my God, and plead my case in court,</p><p>and successfully defend me!</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>Yahweh, my God, because you are righteous,</p><p>prove that I am innocent</p><p>in order that my enemies will not be able to gloat that I was judged to be guilty.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>Do not allow them to be able to say to themselves,</p><p>“Yes, we have gotten rid of him [IDM] just like we desired!”</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>Cause those who rejoice about my misfortunes</p><p>to be completely defeated and disgraced;</p><p>cause those who boast that they are much greater than me</p><p>to be disgraced and dishonored!</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>But cause those who desire that I be acquitted</p><p>to be happy and shout joyfully,</p><p>and cause them to continually say, “Yahweh is great!</p><p>He is delighted to cause things to go well for those who serve him.”</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>Then I will proclaim that you act righteously,</p><p>and I will praise you all day long.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-36"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-36">36</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written for the choir director by David, a man who served God faithfully</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Wicked people continually desire to sin.</p><p>They consider [IDM] that they do not need to revere God.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Because they are very proud,</p><p>they do not think that God will discover their sins and condemn them (OR, they do not think about their sins and hate themselves for it).</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    Everything that they say is deceitful and full of lies;</p><p>they no longer do what is good</p><p>and are no longer wise.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>While they are lying on their beds, they plan to do things to harm others;</p><p>they are determined to do things that are not good,</p><p>and they never refuse to do what is evil.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Yahweh, your faithful love for us reaches as high as the heavens,</p><p>you faithfully do what you have promised;</p><p>
    it is as though your doing that extends up to the clouds.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Your righteous behavior is as permanent as the highest mountains [MET],</p><p>your acting justly will continue as long as the deepest oceans exist.</p><p>You take care of people and you take care of animals.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>God, your faithful love for us is very precious.</p><p>You protect us like birds protect their baby birds under their wings [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>You provide for us plenty of food from the abundant supply [IDM] that you have;</p><p>your great blessings for us flow like a river.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>You are the one who causes everything to live;</p><p>your light is what enables us to see.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Continue to faithfully love those who have experienced a relationship with you,</p><p>and bless those who act righteously/justly.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Do not allow proud people [SYN] to attack me,</p><p>or allow wicked people to chase me away.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Look where evil people have fallen on the ground, defeated;</p><p>they were thrown down, and they will never rise again.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-37"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-37">37</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Do not be bothered/upset by what wicked people do.</p><p>Do not desire to have the things that people who do wrong/evil have,</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>because they will soon disappear, like grass withers in the hot sun and dries up.</p><p>Just like some green plants come up but die during the hot summer,</p><p>evil people will soon die also.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Trust in Yahweh, and do what is good;</p><p>if you do that, you will live safely in the land that he has given you,</p><p>and you will live peacefully [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Be delighted with all that Yahweh does for you;</p><p>if you do that, he will give you the things that you desire most.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Commit to Yahweh all the things that you plan to do;</p><p>trust in him,</p><p>and he will do whatever is needed to help you.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>He will show as clearly as the sunlight that you ◄are innocent/have done nothing that is wrong►;</p><p>he will show as clearly as the sun at noontime [SIM]</p><p>that all the things that you have decided are just.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Be quiet in Yahweh’s presence, and wait patiently for him to do what you want him to do.</p><p>Do not be bothered/upset when what evil men do is successful,</p><p>when they are able to do the wicked things that they plan.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Do not be angry about what wicked people do.</p><p>Do not want to punish them yourself.</p><p>Do not be envious of such people</p><p>because you will only harm yourself if you try to envy them.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    Some day Yahweh will get rid of wicked people,</p><p>but those who trust in Yahweh will live safely in the land that he has given to them.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Soon the wicked will disappear.</p><p>If you look for them, they will be gone.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>But those who are humble will live safely in their land.</p><p>They will happily enjoy living peacefully and having the other good things that Yahweh gives them.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Wicked people plan to harm righteous/godly people;</p><p>they snarl at them [MET] like wild animals.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>But Yahweh laughs at them</p><p>because he knows that some day [MTY] he will judge and punish the wicked people.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>Wicked people pull out their swords/daggers</p><p>and they put strings on their bows,</p><p>ready to kill people who are poor [DOU]</p><p>and to slaughter those who live righteously.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>But they will be killed by their own swords/daggers,</p><p>and their bows will be broken.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>It is good to be righteous/godly even if you do not have many possessions,</p><p>but it is bad to be wicked, even if you are very wealthy,</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>because Yahweh will completely take away the strength of wicked people,</p><p>but he will ◄sustain/take care of► people who live righteously.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>Every day Yahweh cares about those who have not done any evil things;</p><p>the things that Yahweh gives them will last forever.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>They will survive when calamities occur;</p><p>when there are famines, they will still have plenty to eat.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>But wicked people will die;</p><p>
    just like the beautiful wild flowers in the fields die under the hot sun and disappear like smoke [MET],</p><p>Yahweh will cause his enemies to suddenly disappear.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>The wicked people borrow money, but they are not able to repay it;</p><p>righteous/godly people, in contrast, have enough money that they can give generously to others.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>Those whom Yahweh has blessed will live safely in the land that he has given to them,</p><p>but he will get rid of those people whom he has cursed.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>Yahweh protects those who do what is pleasing to him,</p><p>and he will enable them to walk confidently, wherever they go;</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>even if they stumble, they will not fall down,</p><p>because Yahweh holds them by his hand.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>I was young previously, and now I am an old man,</p><p>but in all those years, I have never seen righteous/godly people being abandoned by Yahweh,</p><p>nor have I seen that their children needed to beg for food.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>Righteous/Godly people are generous, and happily lend money to others,</p><p>and their children are a blessing to them.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>Turn away from doing evil, and do what is good.</p><p>If you do that, you and your descendants will live in your land forever.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>
    That will happen because Yahweh likes to see people doing what is just,</p><p>and he will never forsake righteous/godly people.</p><p>He will protect them forever;</p><p>but he will get rid of the children of wicked people.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>Righteous/Godly people will own the land that Yahweh promised to give to them,</p><p>and they will live there forever.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>Righteous people give wise advice to others,</p><p>and they [MTY] say what is just/fair.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>They continually think about God’s laws;</p><p>they do not stray from God’s path.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>Those who are evil wait in ambush for righteous people</p><p>in order to kill them as they walk by.</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>But Yahweh will not abandon righteous people,</p><p>and allow ◄them to fall into their enemies’ hands/their enemies harm them►.</p><p>And he will not allow righteous people to be condemned</p><p>when someone takes them to a judge to be put on trial.</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>Be patient and trust that Yahweh will help you,</p><p>and ◄walk on his paths/do what he wants you to do►.</p><p>
    If you do that, he will honor you by giving you the land that he promised,</p><p>and when he gets rid of the wicked, you will see it happen.</p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>I have seen that wicked people who ◄act like tyrants/terrify people► sometimes prosper, like trees that grow well in fertile soil,</p><p>
    <sup>36</sup>when I looked later, they were gone!</p><p>I searched for them, but Yahweh had caused them to disappear.</p><p>
    <sup>37</sup>Notice the people who have not done evil things, those who act righteously:</p><p>their descendants will have peace in their inner beings.</p><p>
    <sup>38</sup>But Yahweh will get rid of the wicked;</p><p>he will also get rid of their descendants (OR, as a result, they will not have any descendants).</p><p>
    <sup>39</sup>Yahweh rescues righteous people;</p><p>in times of trouble he protects them [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>40</sup>Yahweh helps them and saves them;</p><p>he rescues them from being attacked/harmed by wicked people</p><p>because they go to him to be protected [MET].</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-38"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-38">38</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David, asking God not to forget him</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh, when you are angry with me,</p><p>do not rebuke/scold me and punish me!</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    Now it is as though you have shot your arrows at me and wounded me;</p><p>you have struck me and knocked me down.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Because you have been angry with me,</p><p>I am suffering great pain.</p><p>Because of my sin,</p><p>my whole body is diseased.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>All my sins are like a flood that covers my head;</p><p>they are like a load that is very heavy, with the result that I cannot carry it.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Because I have done foolish things,</p><p>I have sores that have become worse, and they stink.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    Sometimes I am bent over, and sometimes I lie prostrate;</p><p>I am sad/cry all day.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>My body is burning with fever,</p><p>and I am very ill.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>I am completely exhausted, and I have no strength.</p><p>I am very distressed, and I groan with pain.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Yahweh, you know that I desire to be healed;</p><p>you hear me while I am groaning.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>My heat is pounding heavily, and all my strength is gone.</p><p>I am no longer able to see well.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>My friends and neighbors stay away from me because of my sores;</p><p>even my own family stays away from me.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>And those who want to kill me set traps to catch me;</p><p>those who want to harm me discuss ways to get rid of me;</p><p>they plot against me all day.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Now I act like I’m deaf, and do not listen to what they say.</p><p>I act like I cannot talk, so I say nothing to reply to them.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>I act like a man who does not answer when people talk to him,</p><p>because he cannot hear anything.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>But Yahweh, I trust in you.</p><p>My Lord God, you will answer me.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>I said to you, “Do not cause me to die, with the result that my enemies will rejoice!</p><p>Do not cause me to stumble, with the result that they will be very happy!”</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>I say that because I am about to fall down,</p><p>and I constantly have pain.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>I confess the wrong things that I have done;</p><p>I am very sorry for the sins that I have committed.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>My enemies are healthy and strong;</p><p>there are many people who hate me for no reason.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>Those who do evil things to me in return for my doing good things to them</p><p>oppose me because I try to do what is right.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>Yahweh, do not abandon me!</p><p>My God, do not stay far from me!</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>Lord, you are the one who saves/rescues me;</p><p>Quickly come and help me!</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-39"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-39">39</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David for Jeduthun, the choir director</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>I said to myself, “I will be careful not to sin by the things that I say [MTY].</p><p>I will not say anything to complain</p><p>while wicked people are near to me and can hear me.”</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    So I was completely silent [DOU], and I did not even talk about things that were good,</p><p>but it was useless, because I began to suffer even more.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>I became very anxious/worried [IDM].</p><p>As I thought about my troubles, I became more worried.</p><p>Then finally I said [MTY],</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>“Yahweh, show/tell me how long I will live.</p><p>Tell me when I will die.</p><p>Tell me how many years I will live!</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    It seems that you have caused me to live only a short time;</p><p>◄my lifetime/all the time that I have lived► seems like nothing to you.</p><p>The time that all we humans live is as short as [MET] a puff of wind.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Then we disappear like a shadow does.</p><p>It seems that all that we do is for nothing/useless.</p><p>We sometimes get a lot of money, but we do not know who will get it after we die.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>So now, Yahweh, if I expect [RHQ] to receive blessings from other people, I will be disappointed.</p><p>You are the only one from whom I confidently expect to receive blessings.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Save me from being punished for all the sins that I have committed.</p><p>And do not allow foolish people to make fun of me.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>I did not say anything when you punished me,</p><p>because I knew that you were the one who caused me to suffer.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>But now, please stop punishing me!</p><p>
    If you do not do that, I am about to die because of the ways that you [SYN] have struck/afflicted me.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>When you rebuke someone and punish him for the sin that he has committed,</p><p>you destroy the things that ◄he loves/are precious to him►, like moths’ larva destroy clothing.</p><p>Our lives disappear like a puff of wind.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Yahweh, listen to me while I pray;</p><p>pay attention to me while I cry out to you.</p><p>Help me while I am crying.</p><p>I am here on the earth for only a short time,</p><p>like all my ancestors.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    Now please leave me alone, and do not punish me any more</p><p>in order that I may smile and be happy for a while before I die. [EUP, DOU]”</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-40"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-40">40</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David for the choir director</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>I waited patiently for Yahweh to help me,</p><p>and he listened to me [DOU] when I called out to him.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    When I had many troubles, it was as though I was in a deep pit.</p><p>But he lifted me up out of the mud and slime of that pit;</p><p>he set my feet on a solid rock,</p><p>and enabled me to walk ◄safely/without falling►.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>He has given me a new song to sing,</p><p>a song to praise him who is our God.</p><p>Many people will find out what he has done for me,</p><p>and they will revere and trust him.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Yahweh is pleased with those who trust him,</p><p>those who do not trust in idols</p><p>or join with those who worship those false gods.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>O Yahweh, my God, you have done many wonderful things!</p><p>No one can list all the wonderful things that you have planned for us.</p><p>If I tried to tell others about all those wonderful things,</p><p>I would not be able to,</p><p>because there would be too many for me to mention.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Various kinds of sacrifices and other offerings are not the only things that delight you.</p><p>You have enabled me to understand that very well [IDM].</p><p>
    Animals burned on the altar and other offerings</p><p>are not all that you require for sins to be forgiven.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>So I said to you, “Yahweh, here I am,</p><p>
    to do the things that have been written in the scroll that contains your laws,</p><p>things that you want me to do.”</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>O my God, I delight to do what you desire;</p><p>I keep your laws within my inner being.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Whenever all your people are gathered,</p><p>I have told them about how you save us.</p><p>Yahweh, you know that I have not been afraid to tell that to them.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>And I have not kept to myself the news that you always act justly/fairly;</p><p>when many of your people have gathered together to worship you in the temple,</p><p>I have told them that you are faithful to us and save us.</p><p>I have ◄not concealed/openly told people► that you faithfully love us and act loyally toward us.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Yahweh, do not stop being merciful to me.</p><p>Because you faithfully love me [PRS] and are loyal to me, always protect me.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>I have many troubles; so many that I cannot count them.</p><p>My sins are like a flood that has covered me [PRS, MET];</p><p>
    they are so many that I cannot find my way.</p><p>The sins that I have committed are more than the hairs on my head.</p><p>I am very discouraged.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>O Yahweh, please save me!</p><p>Come quickly to help me!</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>Humble those who are happy about my troubles, and cause them to be disgraced and ashamed.</p><p>Chase away those who are trying to get rid of me.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>I hope/desire that those who make fun of me</p><p>will be dismayed when you defeat them.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>But I hope that all those who go to worship you will be very joyful [DOU].</p><p>I want those who love you because you saved them to shout repeatedly,</p><p>“Yahweh is great!”</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>As for me, I am poor and needy [DOU];</p><p>but I know that Yahweh has not forgotten me.</p><p>O my God, you are the one who saves and helps me,</p><p>so please come quickly and help me!</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-41"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-41">41</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David for the choir director</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh is pleased with those people who help to provide for the poor;</p><p>he will rescue those people when they have troubles.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Yahweh protects them and allows them to live for a long time.</p><p>He enables them to be happy in the land of Israel,</p><p>and rescues them from their enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>When they are sick, Yahweh strengthens them,</p><p>and he heals them.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    When I was sick, I said, “Yahweh, be merciful to me and heal me;</p><p>
    I know that I am sick because I have sinned against you.”</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>My enemies say cruel things about me;</p><p>they say, “How soon will he die, and then everyone will forget about him [MTY]? (OR, he will not have any descendants to continue his name).”</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>When my enemies come to me, they falsely say that they are concerned about me.</p><p>They listen to bad news about ◄me/my health►.</p><p>Then they go away and tell everywhere what is happening to me.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>All those who hate me whisper to others about me,</p><p>and they hope/desire that very bad things will happen to me.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>They say, “He will soon die because of his being sick;</p><p>he will never get up from his bed before he dies.”</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Even my best friend, whom I trusted very much,</p><p>who often ate with me,</p><p>has ◄betrayed me/put me into my enemies’ hands► [IDM].</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>But Yahweh, be merciful to me, and enable me to become healthy again.</p><p>When you do that, I will be able to ◄pay back my enemies/get revenge on my enemies/cause my enemies to suffer like they caused me to suffer►.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    If you enable me to do that, with the result that my enemies do not defeat me,</p><p>I will know that you are pleased with me.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    I will know that it is because I have done what is right that you have helped me,</p><p>and I will know that you will let me be with you forever.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Praise Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis worship;</p><p>Praise him forever!</p><p>Amen! I desire that it will be so!</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-42"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-42">42</h3></a>
<p>Book Two</p><p>A psalm written by one of the descendants of Korah for the choir director</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Deer pant, desiring to drink water from a stream when there is a drought (OR, when they are being pursued by hunters.)</p><p>In the same way [SIM], God, I need you very much.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>I desire to have fellowship with [MET] you, the all-powerful God.</p><p>
    I wonder, “When will I be able to go back to the temple in Israel</p><p>and worship in your presence again?”</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Every day and every night I cry;</p><p>
    it is as though the only thing I have to drink is my tears;</p><p>and while I do that, my enemies are continually asking me,</p><p>“Why does your god not help you?”</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>I am very distressed [IDM] as I remember</p><p>when I went with the crowd of people to the temple in Jerusalem,</p><p>leading them as we walked along;</p><p>we were all shouting joyfully and singing to thank God for what he had done;</p><p>we were a large group who were celebrating.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>So I say to myself, “◄Why am I sad and discouraged?/I should not be sad and discouraged!► [RHQ]</p><p>I confidently expect God to help me,</p><p>and again I will praise him,</p><p>my God, the one who saves me.”</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    But now, Yahweh, I am very discouraged [IDM],</p><p>so I think about you,</p><p>even from where the Jordan River gushes out from the bottom of Hermon Mountain and from Mizar Mountain.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>But here, the great sorrow that I feel is like water that you send down [MET];</p><p>
    it is like a waterfall that tumbles down and floods over me.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Yahweh shows me each day that he faithfully loves me,</p><p>and each night I sing to him</p><p>and pray to him, the God who causes me to live.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>I say to God, who is like an overhanging rock under which I can hide [MET],</p><p>“It seems that you have forgotten me.</p><p>I &lt;mourn/cry&gt; constantly because my enemies act cruelly toward me” [RHQ].</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>They make fun of me constantly;</p><p>they continually ask, “Why does your god not help you?” [RHQ]</p><p>And when they insult me like that,</p><p>
    it is like wounds that I feel even in my bones.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>But I think,</p><p>“◄Why am I sad and discouraged?/I should not be sad and discouraged!► [RHQ]</p><p>I will confidently expect God to help me,</p><p>and I will praise him again,</p><p>my God, the one who saves me.”</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-43"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-43">43</h3></a>
<p>(A continuation of psalm 42)</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>God, declare that I ◄am innocent/have not done things that are wrong►.</p><p>Defend me when ◄ungodly people/people who do not worship you► say things against me,</p><p>rescue me from people who deceive and say things about me that are not true.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>You are God, the one who protects me;</p><p>◄why have you abandoned me?/it seems that you have abandoned me!► [RHQ]</p><p>It does not seem right that [RHQ] I am forced to mourn/cry constantly</p><p>because my enemies are cruel to me.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Shine your light on me and speak your truth to me;</p><p>and let them guide me,</p><p>and take me back to Zion, your sacred hill at Jerusalem,</p><p>and to your temple, where you live.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>When you do that, I will go to your altar,</p><p>to worship you, my God, who causes me to be extremely joyful.</p><p>There I will praise you, the God whom I worship, while I play my harp.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>So ◄why am I sad and discouraged?/I should not be sad and discouraged!► [RHQ]</p><p>I confidently expect God to bless me,</p><p>and I will praise him again,</p><p>my God, the one who saves me.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-44"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-44">44</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by one of the descendants of Korah for the choir director</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>God, we ourselves have heard</p><p>what our parents and grandparents told us.</p><p>They told us about the miracles</p><p>that you performed long ago.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    They told us how you expelled the ungodly people</p><p>and enabled us to live in their land.</p><p>
    They told us that you punished those ungodly people</p><p>and enabled your own people to prosper [IDM].</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>It was not by using their own swords that they conquered the people that lived in that land,</p><p>and it was not by their own power that they were victorious;</p><p>it was only by your power [MTY, DOU] that they did those things;</p><p>and they were sure that you were with them,</p><p>and that showed that you were pleased with them.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>You are my King and my God;</p><p>it is you who enable us, your people [MTY], to defeat our enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>It is by your power that we knock our enemies down and tramp on them.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>I do not trust that I will be saved</p><p>by using my bow and arrows and my sword.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>No, it is you who have rescued us from our enemies,</p><p>it is you who have caused those who hate us to become ashamed because they were defeated.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>We have continually boasted about what God has done for us,</p><p>and we will thank him [MTY] forever.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>But now you have rejected us and caused us to be disgraced;</p><p>when our armies march out to fight a battle, you no longer go with them.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>You have caused us to run away from our enemies,</p><p>with the result that they captured the things that belonged to us.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>You have allowed us to become like [MET] sheep that were ready to be slaughtered;</p><p>you scattered us far away among other nations.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    It is as though [MET] you sold us, your people, to our enemies for a very small price,</p><p>and you did not gain much profit from selling us!</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>People who live in nations near us make fun of us;</p><p>they laugh at us and deride/belittle us.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>They make jokes using the name of our country,</p><p>they shake their heads to indicate that they despise us.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>All day I feel disgraced;</p><p>from seeing my face, people know that I am ashamed.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>I hear what those who sneer at me and revile me say;</p><p>I am ashamed in front of my enemies and those who want to harm me.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>All these things have happened to us</p><p>
    even though we have not forgotten you,</p><p>and we are not the ones who disobeyed the agreement you made with our ancestors.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>We have not stopped being loyal to you,</p><p>and we have not stopped doing what you want us to do [IDM].</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>But it is as though you have allowed us to be helpless among wild animals,</p><p>and abandoned us in a deep dark ravine.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>If we had forgotten to worship [MTY] our God,</p><p>or if we had spread out our hands to worship a foreign god,</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>you certainly would have known that,</p><p>because you know even what we secretly think.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>But it is because we belong to you,</p><p>
    that our enemies are constantly killing us.</p><p>They act toward us as though we were only sheep to be slaughtered.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    So, Yahweh, arise! Why are you asleep [RHQ]?</p><p>Get up! Do not reject us forever!</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>Why are you not looking at us?</p><p>Why are you forgetting that we are suffering and being oppressed by our enemies?</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>We are pushed down to the ground</p><p>and we cannot get up.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>Arise, and come and help us!</p><p>Rescue us because you faithfully love us!</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-45"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-45">45</h3></a>
<p>A love song written by one of the descendants of Korah, for the choir director, to be sung to the tune ‘Lilies’</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>In my inner being I am stirred by a beautiful message</p><p>which will be sung to the king.</p><p>The words of this message will be written with a pen by me, a skilled writer.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    O King, you are the most handsome man in the world,</p><p>and you always speak [MTY] eloquently,</p><p>because God has always blessed you.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>You who are a mighty warrior, put on your sword!</p><p>You are glorious and majestic.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Ride on like a great chief</p><p>to defend the truth that you speak</p><p>and the fair decisions that you make!</p><p>Because you are strong [MTY],</p><p>you will do awesome deeds.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Your arrows are sharp,</p><p>and they pierce the hearts of your enemies.</p><p>Soldiers of many nations will fall dead at your feet.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>The kingdom [MTY] that God will give to you will remain forever.</p><p>You rule [MTY] people justly.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>You love right actions,</p><p>and you hate evil actions.</p><p>Therefore God, your God, has chosen [MTY] you to be king</p><p>and caused you to be happier [MET] than any other king.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>The perfume of various spices is on your robes.</p><p>
    People ◄entertain you/make you happy► in ivory palaces</p><p>by playing stringed instruments.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Among the women who stay near you [EUP] stay are daughters of other kings.</p><p>And at your right hand stands your bride, the queen, wearing beautiful ornaments of gold that comes from Ophir.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    Now I will say something to your bride:</p><p>Listen to me carefully [DOU]!</p><p>Forget the people who live in your home country,</p><p>forget your relatives!</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Because you are very beautiful,</p><p>the king will desire to sleep with [EUP] you.</p><p>He is your master, so you must obey him.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>The people from Tyre city will bring gifts to you;</p><p>their rich people will try to persuade you to do favors for them.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    O king, your bride will be entering the palace</p><p>wearing beautiful robes made from gold thread.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>While she is wearing a gown that has many colors,</p><p>her companions will lead her to you.</p><p>She will have many other young women who accompany her.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>They will be very joyful [DOU] as they are led along</p><p>to enter your palace.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>Some day, your sons and your grandsons will become kings,</p><p>just like your ancestors were.</p><p>You will enable them to become rulers in many countries [HYP].</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>And as for me, I will enable people in every generation to remember the great things that you [MTY] have done,</p><p>and people will praise you forever.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-46"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-46">46</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by one of the descendants of Korah for the choir director</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>God is the one who protects us and causes us to be strong;</p><p>he is always ready to help us when we have troubles.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>So, even if the earth shakes,</p><p>we will not be afraid.</p><p>Even if the mountains fall into the middle of the sea,</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>and if the water in the sea roars and foams,</p><p>and the hills shake violently,</p><p>we will not be afraid!</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    Blessings that come from God are like a river that makes everyone in the city where we worship God joyful.</p><p>It is the city where the temple of God, who is greater than any other god, exists.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>God is in this city, and it will never be destroyed;</p><p>he will come to help the people in that city at dawn every day.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    Sometimes the people of many nations are terrified;</p><p>kingdoms ◄are overthrown/cease to exist►;</p><p>God speaks loudly like thunder,</p><p>and the earth melts (OR, people everywhere become terrified) [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>But Yahweh, the commander of the armies of heaven, is with us;</p><p>the God whom Jacob worshiped (OR, we Israeli people worship) is our refuge.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Come and ◄see/think about► the amazing things that Yahweh has done [DOU]!</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>He stops wars all over the world;</p><p>he breaks bows and arrows;</p><p>he destroys spears;</p><p>he burns up shields.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    God says, “Be quiet, and remember that I am God!</p><p>I will be honored by the people of all nations.</p><p>I will be honored all over the earth.”</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    So never forget that Yahweh, the commander of the armies of heaven, is with us;</p><p>the God whom Jacob worshiped (OR, we Israeli people worship) is our refuge.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-47"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-47">47</h3></a>

    <sup>1</sup>You people all over the world, clap your hands for joy!</p><p>Shout joyfully to praise God!</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Yahweh, who is much greater than any other god, is awesome;</p><p>he is the king who rules over all the world!</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>He enabled us to defeat the armies of the people-groups that lived in Canaan.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>He chose for us this land where we now live;</p><p>we Israeli people [MTY], whom he loves, are proud that we own this land.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>God has gone up into his temple.</p><p>The people shouted joyfully and blew trumpets as Yahweh went up.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Sing songs to praise our God!</p><p>Sing to praise him [DOU]!</p><p>Sing to God, our king!</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>God is the one who rules over everything in the world;</p><p>sing a psalm to him!</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>God sits on his sacred throne</p><p>as he rules over the people of all ethnic groups.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>The rulers of those people-groups gather as God’s people, the people descended from Abraham, do.</p><p>But God has more power than the weapons/shields of all the kings on the earth;</p><p>◄he is greatly honored/people honor him► everywhere.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-48"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-48">48</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by one of the descendants of Korah</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh is great, and he deserves to be greatly praised in the city where he lives,</p><p>
    which is built on Zion, his sacred hill.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>That city, on a high hill, is beautiful;</p><p>it is the city where the true God, the great king, lives,</p><p>and it causes people all over the world to rejoice when they see it.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>God is in the strong towers there,</p><p>and he shows that he protects the people in that city.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Many kings gathered with their armies to attack that city,</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>but when they saw it, they were amazed;</p><p>they became terrified, and ran away.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Because they were very afraid, they trembled</p><p>like a woman who is about to give birth to a child;</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>they shook like ships sailing from Tarshish are shaken by a strong wind.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>We had heard that this city is glorious,</p><p>and now we have seen that it is.</p><p>It is the city in which Yahweh, the almighty one, lives.</p><p>It is the city which God will preserve/protect forever.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>God, here in your temple we think about how you faithfully love us.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>You [MTY] are famous and ◄are praised/people praise you► all over the earth,</p><p>because you rule powerfully [MTY] and justly.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>The people who live near Zion Hill should be happy!</p><p>The people in all the cities [MTY] in Judah should rejoice</p><p>because you judge people fairly.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    You Israeli people should walk around Zion Hill</p><p>and count the towers there;</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>notice the walls there and examine the forts</p><p>in order that you can tell about them to your children.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    Say to them, “This is the city that belongs to our God, the one who lives forever;</p><p>he will guide us all of our lives.”</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-49"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-49">49</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written for the choir director by one of the descendants of Korah</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>You people of all ethnic groups, listen!</p><p>You people all over the world,</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>important people and unimportant people,</p><p>rich people and poor people,</p><p>everyone, listen to what I am saying,</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    because what I am thinking is very sensible,</p><p>and what I say will enable you to become wise!</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>I think about [MTY] ◄proverbs/wise sayings►,</p><p>and while I play my harp, I explain what they mean.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>I am not [RHQ] afraid when I am in trouble/danger,</p><p>when I am surrounded by my enemies,</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>by evil men who trust that things will always go well for them because they are wealthy,</p><p>and who boast about being very rich.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    They may be rich, but no one can pay money</p><p>with the result that he would live forever!</p><p>No one can pay God enough so that God will allow him to continue to live,</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>because that cost is too great,</p><p>and he will never be able to pay enough</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>with the result that he will live forever</p><p>and never die and be buried!</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>We see that foolish and stupid people die,</p><p>but we see that wise people also die;</p><p>they all leave their wealth, and others inherit it.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Those wise people once had houses on land that they owned,</p><p>
    but now their graves are their homes forever,</p><p>the place where they will stay for all time!</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Even if people are great, that cannot prevent them from dying;</p><p>all people die, the same as animals do.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>That is what happens to those who foolishly trust in what they have accomplished,</p><p>to those who are delighted in all that they possess.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>They are certain to die just like sheep,</p><p>when a shepherd leads them away to be slaughtered. [PRS, MET]</p><p>In the morning righteous people will rule over them,</p><p>and then those wealthy people will die and their bodies will quickly decay in their graves;</p><p>they will be where dead people are, far from their homes.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>But it is certain that God will rescue me</p><p>so that I am not kept in the place of the dead.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    So, do not be dismayed when someone becomes rich</p><p>and the houses where they live become more and more luxurious,</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>because when he dies, he will take nothing with him;</p><p>his wealth will not go with him.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>While a rich person is alive, he congratulates himself,</p><p>and people praise him for being successful,</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>but he will die, joining his ancestors,</p><p>who will never see daylight again.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>Even if someone is great, that cannot prevent him from dying;</p><p>he will die, the same as animals do.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-50"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-50">50</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by Asaph</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>God, the all-powerful one, speaks;</p><p>he summons all people,</p><p>from the east to the west.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>His glory shines from Zion Hill in Jerusalem,</p><p>an extremely beautiful city.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Our God comes to us,</p><p>and he is not silent.</p><p>A great fire is in front of him,</p><p>and a storm is around him.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>He comes to judge his people.</p><p>He shouts to the angels in heaven</p><p>and to the people on the earth.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>He says, “Summon those who faithfully worship me,</p><p>those who made an agreement with me by offering sacrifices to me.”</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>The angels in heaven declare,</p><p>“God is righteous,</p><p>and he is the supreme judge.”</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>God says, “My people, listen!</p><p>You Israeli people, listen,</p><p>as I, your God, say what you have done that is wrong.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>I am not rebuking you for making sacrifices to me,</p><p>for the offerings that you completely burn on the altar.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>But I do not really need you to sacrifice </p><p>the bulls from your barns and the goats from your pens,</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>because all the animals in the forest belong to me,</p><p>
    and all the cattle on 1,000 hills also belong to me.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>I own and know all the birds</p><p>and all the creatures  that move around in the fields.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    So, if I were hungry, I would not tell you to bring me some food,</p><p>because everything in the world belongs to me!</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>I do not eat the flesh of the bulls that you sacrifice,</p><p>and I do not drink the blood of the goats that you offer to me.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>The sacrifice that I really want is that you thank me</p><p>and do all that you have promised to do.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>And pray to me when you have troubles.</p><p>
    If you do that, I will rescue you, and then you will praise me.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>But I say this to the wicked people:</p><p>◄Why do you/It does not benefit you at all to► [RHQ] recite my commandments</p><p>or talk about the agreement that I made with you,</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>because you have refused to allow me to discipline you,</p><p>and you have rejected what I told you to do.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>Every time that you see a thief, you become his friend,</p><p>and you spend much time with those who commit adultery.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>You are always talking [MTY] about doing wicked things,</p><p>and you are always trying to deceive people.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>You are always accusing members of your own family of doing wrong,</p><p>and slandering them.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>You did all those things, and I did not say anything to you,</p><p>
    so you thought that I was a sinner just like you.</p><p>But now I rebuke you and accuse you, right in front of you.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>So, all you who have ignored me, pay attention to this,</p><p>because if you do not, I will tear you to pieces,</p><p>and there will be no one to rescue you.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>The sacrifice that truly honors me is to thank me for what I have done;</p><p>and I will save those who always do the things that I want them to.”</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-51"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-51">51</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David for the choir director, concerning the time when the prophet Nathan rebuked David after he had committed adultery with Bathsheba</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>O God, be merciful to me,</p><p>because you love me faithfully;</p><p>because you are very merciful,</p><p>erase the record of the ways that I disobeyed you!</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Make me pure from the wrong things that I have done;</p><p>make me clean from the guilt of my sin.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    I say that because I know the ways that I have disobeyed you;</p><p>I cannot forget them.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>You, you only, are the one that I have really sinned against,</p><p>and you have seen the evil things that I have done.</p><p>When you say that I am guilty, you are right/correct,</p><p>and when you judge me, you justly say that I deserve to be punished.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>I have been a sinner since the day that I was born;</p><p>
    truly, I have been like that since my mother conceived me.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>What you desire is that I desire what is true</p><p>in order that you can teach me how to act wisely.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Purify me from the guilt of my sins, and after that happens, I will be clean in my inner being;</p><p>cleanse me, and then in my inner being I will be ◄whiter than snow/very clean►.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Allow/Cause me to be joyful [DOU] again;</p><p>you have ◄crushed my spirit/completely discouraged me► [MTY];</p><p>
    but now let me rejoice again.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Do not continue to look at the sins [IDM] that I have committed;</p><p>erase the record of the evil things that I have done.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>O God, cause my inner being to be pure.</p><p>Put new thoughts  within me and make me faithful again.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Do not send me away from you because of my sin,</p><p>and do not take your Holy Spirit from me.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Cause/Allow me to be happy again because of knowing that you have freed me from the guilt of my sin,</p><p>and make me willing to obey you.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>If you do that, I will be able to teach other sinners what you want them to do,</p><p>and they will repent and begin to obey you.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>O God, you are the one who saves me;</p><p>forgive me for being guilty of causing someone who was not my enemy to die.</p><p>
    When you do that, I will sing joyfully about your being very good and righteous.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>O Yahweh, help me to speak</p><p>
    in order that I may praise you.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>You are not pleased only with the sacrifices that people bring to you.</p><p>If that were enough to please you, I would bring you sacrifices.</p><p>You are not pleased with burnt offerings alone.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>The sacrifice that you really want is for people to be truly humble and sorry for having sinned;</p><p>O God, you will not refuse that kind of sacrifice.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    O God, be good to the people who live in Jerusalem [MTY],</p><p>
    and help them to rebuild the city walls.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>When that happens, they will bring you the proper sacrifices,</p><p>animals that they will completely burn,</p><p>young bulls that they will burn on your altar,</p><p>and you will be pleased.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-52"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-52">52</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David for the choir director, when Doeg went to Saul and said, “David has gone to talk with Ahimelech, the Supreme Priest”</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>You people think that you are strong</p><p>and brag about the sins that you have committed,</p><p>while you plan to harm godly people.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>All during the day you plan to get rid of others;</p><p>what you say [MTY] injures others like a sharp razor [SIM],</p><p>and you are always deceiving others.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>You like doing what is evil more than you like doing what is good,</p><p>and you like telling lies more than you like telling the truth.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>You who say things [MTY] to deceive people,</p><p>you like to say ◄things that hurt people/cruel things►!</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>But God will get rid of you forever;</p><p>he will grab you and drag you from your home</p><p>and take you away from this world where people are alive.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>When righteous people see that, they will be awestruck,</p><p>and they will laugh at what happened to you, and say,</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>“Look what happened to the man who would not ask God to protect him;</p><p>he trusted that his great wealth would save him;</p><p>he trusted in the money that he got by wickedly taking it from others!”</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>But I am secure/safe because I worship in God’s temple;</p><p>I am like a strong green olive tree.</p><p>I trust in God, who faithfully loves us forever.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>God, I will always thank you for the things that you have done.</p><p>As I stand before godly people, I will proclaim that you are good (OR, the many good [MTY] things you have done for us).</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-53"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-53">53</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David for the choir director, to be sung using a tune called ‘Mahalath’</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Only foolish people say to themselves, “There is no God!”</p><p>People who say that are corrupt; they commit terrible sins;</p><p>there is not one of them who does what is good/right.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>God looks down from heaven and sees humans;</p><p>he looks to see if anyone is very wise,</p><p>with the result that he seeks to know God.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    But they are all morally corrupt;</p><p>no one does what is good/right.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Will all these evil people never learn what God will do to them?</p><p>They act violently toward Yahweh’s people while eating the food that he provides,</p><p>and they never pray to Yahweh.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>But some day those people will become terrified,</p><p>like they have never been terrified before,</p><p>because God will cause those who are separated from him to die,</p><p>and he will disrespect them by scattering their bones.</p><p>They have rejected God,</p><p>so he will cause them to be defeated and completely disgraced.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>I wish/desire that someone from Jerusalem [MTY] would come and rescue the Israeli people!</p><p>God, when you bless your people again,</p><p>
    all the Israeli people, all the descendants of Jacob, will rejoice.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-54"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-54">54</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David for the choir director, to be accompanied by stringed instruments; it was written when the people of Ziph went to Saul and told him that David was hiding in their area</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>God, by your power [MTY, DOU] save me from my enemies,</p><p>and show people that I have not done anything that is wrong!</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>God, listen to my prayer;</p><p>listen to what I say to you,</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>because strangers are trying to attack me;</p><p>proud men are wanting to kill me;</p><p>men who do not have any ◄respect for/interest in► you.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>But God is the one who helps me;</p><p>Yahweh defends/protects me from my enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>He will cause the evil things that they want to do to me to happen to them instead;</p><p>because he faithfully does what he promises, he will get rid of them.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Yahweh, I will gladly give an offering to you because I want to,</p><p>and I will thank you [MTY], for you are good to me;</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>you have rescued me from all my troubles,</p><p>and I have seen that you have defeated my enemies.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-55"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-55">55</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David for the choir director, to be accompanied by stringed instruments</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>God, listen to my prayer,</p><p>and do not turn away from me while I am pleading with you.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Listen to me, and answer me,</p><p>because I am overwhelmed by all my troubles.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>My enemies cause me to be terrified;</p><p>wicked people oppress me.</p><p>They cause me to have great troubles;</p><p>they are angry with me, and they hate me.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>I am terrified,</p><p>and I am very much afraid that I will die.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>I am very fearful and I tremble/shake,</p><p>and I am completely terrified.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>I said, “I wish that I had wings like a dove!</p><p>If I had wings, I would fly away and find a place to rest.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>I would fly far away</p><p>and live in the desert.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>I would quickly find a shelter from my enemies</p><p>
    who are like [MET] a strong wind and rainstorm.”</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Lord, confuse my enemies, and cause their plans to fail,</p><p>because I see them acting violently and causing strife in the city of Jerusalem.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>During each day and night they march around on top of its walls,</p><p>committing crimes and causing trouble.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>They destroy things everywhere.</p><p>They oppress and defraud people in the ◄marketplaces/public squares►.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>If it were an enemy who was making fun of me,</p><p>I could endure it.</p><p>If it were someone who hates me, who despises me,</p><p>I could hide from him.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>But it is someone who is just like me, my companion,</p><p>someone who was my friend who is doing this to me.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>We previously had many good talks together;</p><p>we walked around together in God’s temple.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>I desire/hope that my enemies will die suddenly;</p><p>while they are still young, cause them to go down to the place where the dead people are.</p><p>They they think evil things.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>But I will ask Yahweh, my God, to help me,</p><p>and he will save me.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    Each morning and each noontime and each evening I tell him what I am concerned about, and I moan,</p><p>and he hears my voice.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>I have very many enemies,</p><p>but he will rescue me and bring me back safely from the battles that I fight.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>God is the one who has ruled everything forever,</p><p>and he will listen to me.</p><p>He will cause my enemies to be defeated and disgraced,</p><p>because they do not change their evil behavior</p><p>and they do not revere God.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>My companion, whom I mentioned previously, betrayed his friends</p><p>and broke the agreement that he made with them.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>What he said was easy to listen to, like butter is easy to swallow [MET],</p><p>but in his inner being he hated people;</p><p>his words were soothing like olive oil,</p><p>
    but they hurt people like sharp swords do [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>Put your troubles in Yahweh’s hands,</p><p>and he will take care of you;</p><p>he will never allow righteous people to experience disasters.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>God, you will cause murderers [MTY] and liars to die before they have lived half as long as they expect to live;</p><p>but as for me, I will trust in you.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-56"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-56">56</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David for the choir director, concerning the time the Philistines seized David in Gath; to be sung using the tune ‘Dove on distant oaks’</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>God, be merciful to me because men have harassed me;</p><p>all day my enemies pursue me.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>My enemies harass me all day long;</p><p>there are many of them who proudly attack me.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>But whenever I am afraid,</p><p>I trust in you.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>God, I praise/thank you because you do what you have promised;</p><p>I trust in you, and then I am not afraid.</p><p>Ordinary humans certainly cannot [RHQ] harm me!</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>All day long my enemies claim that I said things that I did not say (OR, try to destroy what I am doing);</p><p>they are always thinking of ways to harm me.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>In order to cause trouble for me, they hide</p><p>and watch everything that I do,</p><p>waiting for an opportunity to kill me [MTY].</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>So, God, punish them for the wicked things that they are doing;</p><p>show that you are angry by defeating those people!</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>You have counted all the times that I have been wandering alone/distressed;</p><p>
    it is as though you have put all my tears in a bottle</p><p>
    in order that you can see how much I have cried.</p><p>
    You have counted my tears and written the number in your book.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>When I call out to you, my God, my enemies will be defeated;</p><p>I know that will happen, because you are fighting for me.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>I praise/thank you that you do what you have promised;</p><p>Yahweh, I will always praise you for that [DOU].</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>I trust in you, and as a result, I will not be afraid.</p><p>I know that humans cannot really [RHQ] harm me!</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>I will bring to you the offering that I promised;</p><p>I will bring an offering to you to thank you,</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>because you have rescued me from being killed;</p><p>you have kept me from stumbling.</p><p>As a result, I will continue to live in your presence in the light that shines on those who are still alive (OR, in the light that enables people to live).</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-57"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-57">57</h3></a>

    <sup>1</sup>God, be merciful to me!</p><p>Act mercifully toward me because I come to you to protect me.</p><p>I ask you to protect me like little birds are protected under their mother’s wings [MET]</p><p>until the storm/danger is ended.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>God, you who are greater than all other gods,</p><p>I cry out to you, the one who enables me to do all that you desire.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>You will answer me from heaven and rescue me,</p><p>but you will cause those who oppress me to be defeated and disgraced!</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>God will always faithfully love me and ◄will be faithful/will do what he promises►.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    Sometimes I am surrounded by my enemies who are like lions that kill humans;</p><p>
    they are like lions that chew with their teeth animals that they kill;</p><p>but my enemies have spears and arrows, not teeth;</p><p>and the false things that they say [MTY] hurt people as much as sharp swords hurt people [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>God, show in the heavens that you are very great!</p><p>And show your glory to people all over the earth!</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    It is as if [MET, HYP] my enemies spread a net to seize me,</p><p>and I became very distressed [IDM].</p><p>
    It is as if [MET, HYP] they dug a deep pit along the path where I walk,</p><p>but they themselves fell into it!</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>God, I have complete confidence [DOU] in you.</p><p>I will sing to you,</p><p>and I will praise you while I sing.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>I will awaken myself;</p><p>I will arise before the sun rises</p><p>and praise you while I play my harp or my ◄lyre/small harp►.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Lord, I will thank you among all the people;</p><p>and I will sing to praise you among many ethnic groups,</p><p>

<p>A psalm written by David for the choir director, to be sung using the tune ‘Do not destroy’</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>When you mighty men speak, you never say what is right;</p><p>you never decide things about people justly [RHQ]!</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>No, in your inner beings you think only about doing what is wrong,</p><p>and you commit violent crimes in this land of Israel.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Wicked people do wrong things and tell lies from the time that they are born [DOU].</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>God, show in the heavens how great you are!</p><p>And show your glory to people all over the earth!</p><p>What wicked people say injures people like the venom of a snake [MET];</p><p>They refuse to listen to good advice, as though they were cobras that were deaf [MET]!</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>As a result, like a snake that does not respond when a charmer plays a flute or when someone sings magic songs,</p><p>
    they do not pay attention when others rebuke them.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>God, as for these enemies who want to attack me like young lions,</p><p>break their teeth!</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Cause them to disappear like water disappears in dry ground!</p><p>Cause the arrows that they shoot to have no ◄heads/sharp points►!</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Cause them to become like snails that disappear in the slime;</p><p>cause them to be like babies that are born dead!</p><p>

    as fast as thornbushes are blown away after they are cut (OR, as fast as a fire heats a pot over burning thorns).</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Righteous people will rejoice when they see wicked people being punished as they deserve;</p><p>they will wash their feet in the blood of wicked people.</p><p>

    <sup>4</sup>It is not because I have committed any sin against them</p><p>that they run and get ready to attack me.</p><p>

<p>A psalm written by David for the choir director, a psalm for teaching, to be sung using the tune ‘Lily of the Promise’. David wrote it during the wars in northern Syria, and Joab’s army, after returning from the battle, killed 12,000 of the Edom people-group in Salt Valley</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    I prayed, “God, you have rejected us Israelis!</p><p>Because you have been angry with us,</p><p>you have enabled our enemies to break through our ranks.</p><p>
    Please enable us to be strong again!</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    When we were defeated, it was as though [MET] there was a big earthquake in our land that caused the ground to split open.</p><p>So now, just as only you can cause the cracks in the land to disappear,</p><p>
    help our army to be strong again,</p><p>because it is as though our country is ◄falling apart/being destroyed►.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>You have caused us, your people, to suffer very much;</p><p>
    it is as though you forced us to drink strong wine that caused us to stagger around after we became drunk.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>But you have raised a battle flag for those who revere you</p><p>in order that they can gather around it and not be killed by the enemies’ arrows.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Answer our prayers and enable us by your power [MTY] to defeat our enemies</p><p>in order that we, the people whom you love, will be saved.”</p><p>

    Then God answered my prayer and spoke from his temple, saying,</p><p>“Because I have conquered your enemies, I will divide up everything in Shechem city,</p><p>and I will distribute it among my people the land in Succoth Valley.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>The Gilead region is mine;</p><p>the people of the tribe of Manasseh are mine;</p><p>
    the tribe of Ephraim is like my helmet [MET];</p><p>and the tribe of Judah is like the ◄scepter/stick that I hold which shows that I am the ruler► [MET];</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>but the Moab region is like my washbasin [MET];</p><p>I throw my sandal in the Edom area to show that it belongs to me;</p><p>I shout triumphantly because I have defeated the people of the Philistia area.”</p><p>

    Because I want to defeat the people of Edom,</p><p>◄who will lead my army triumphantly to their capital city that has strong walls around it?/I want someone to lead my army triumphantly to their capital city that has strong walls around it.►” [RHQ]</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>So, God, we desire/hope that [RHQ] you have not truly abandoned us,</p><p>and that you will go with us when our armies march out to fight our enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    We need you to help us when we fight against our enemies,</p><p>because the help that humans can give us is worthless.</p><p>

<p>A psalm written by David for the choir director, to be accompanied by musical instruments</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>God, listen to me,</p><p>and answer my prayer [DOU]!</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>While I am discouraged and far from my home,</p><p>I am calling out to you.</p><p>Lead me to the place that is like a high rock [MET]</p><p>on top of which I will be safe.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>You have been my refuge;</p><p>you have been like a strong tower [MET]</p><p>
    in which I am safe from being attacked by my enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Allow me to live close to your temple all during my life [HYP]!</p><p>Allow me to be safe [MET], like a little bird is safe under its mother’s wings.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>God, you heard me when I solemnly promised to give offerings to you;</p><p>you have given to me the blessings that belong to those who have an awesome respect for you [MTY].</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    I am the king of Israel;</p><p>
    please allow me to live and rule for many years,</p><p>and allow my descendants to rule also.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Allow us to rule forever while you observe us;</p><p>watch over us while you faithfully love us and do for us what you promised.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>If you do that, I will always sing to praise you [MTY]</p><p>while I offer to you each day the sacrifices that I promised to give to you.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-62"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-62">62</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David for Jeduthun, the choir leader</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>God is the only one who can give me peace in my inner being,</p><p>and he is the one who saves me from my enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Only he is like an overhanging rock under which I can be safe [MET];</p><p>he will be like a shelter, with the result that I will never be defeated [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>When will you, my enemies, stop attacking me [RHQ]?</p><p>I feel that I am as useless against you as a wall that is about to fall over or a broken-down fence [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>My enemies plan to remove me from my important position so that people no longer honor me.</p><p>They delight in telling lies.</p><p>They bless people by what they say [MTY],</p><p>but in their inner beings they curse those people.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>God is the only one who gives me peace in my inner being;</p><p>he is the one whom I confidently expect to help me.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Only he is like an overhanging rock under which I can be safe [MET];</p><p>he is like a shelter, and as a result I will never be defeated.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>God is the one who saves me and honors me.</p><p>He is like an overhanging strong rock under which I can find shelter [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    You my people, always trust in him.</p><p>Tell him all your troubles,</p><p>because he is ◄our refuge/the one who protects us► [MET].</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>People who are considered to be unimportant are as worthless/unreliable as a breath of air;</p><p>people who are considered to be important also really ◄amount to nothing/cannot be trusted to help us►.</p><p>If you put them all on a scale, it would be as if they weighed less than a puff of air.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Do not trust in money gained by extorting it from others;</p><p>do not try to gain anything by robbing others.</p><p>If you become very wealthy, do not trust in [IDM] your money.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>I have heard God say more than once that he is the one who really has power,</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>and that he is the one who faithfully loves us.</p><p>He rewards every one of us according to the deeds that we do.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-63"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-63">63</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David when he was in the desert in Judea</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>God, you are the God whom I worship.</p><p>I greatly desire to be with you</p><p>like [SIL] a person in a dry hot desert greatly desires some cool water.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>So, I want to see you in your temple;</p><p>I want to see that you are great and glorious.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Your constantly loving me is ◄worth more/more precious► than my life,</p><p>so I [MTY] will always praise you.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>I will praise you all the time that I live;</p><p>I will lift up my hands to you while I pray.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Knowing you satisfies me more than [IDM, MET] my eating a very big feast,</p><p>
    so I will praise you while I sing [MTY] joyful songs.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>While I lie on my bed, I think about you.</p><p>I think/meditate about you all during the night,</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>because you have always helped me,</p><p>and I sing joyfully knowing that I am protected by you</p><p>
    as a little bird is protected under its mother’s wings [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>I cling to you;</p><p>and with your hand/power you protect me.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>But those who are trying to kill me</p><p>will die and descend into the place of the dead;</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>they will be killed in battles [MTY]</p><p>and their corpses will be eaten by jackals/wild dogs.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>But I, the king of Israel, will rejoice in what God has done;</p><p>and all those who revere and trust God will praise him,</p><p>but he will not allow liars to say anything.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-64"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-64">64</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David for the choir director</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>God, listen to me as I tell you the things that I am worried about.</p><p>I am afraid of my enemies; so save/rescue me from them.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Protect me from what wicked men are planning to do to me;</p><p>protect me from that gang of men who do what is evil.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>The hostile things they say [MTY] are like [SIM] sharp swords;</p><p>their cruel words are like [SIM] arrows.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Without being afraid, they lie about people and slander people who have not done what is wrong,</p><p>like someone who suddenly jumps up from where he is hiding and shoots arrows at his enemy [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>They encourage each other about doing the evil things that they are planning to do;</p><p>they talk with each other about where they can set traps to catch people,</p><p>and they think, “No one [RHQ] will see what we are doing,</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>because we have planned very well the crime that we are going to commit!”</p><p>No one can fully understand what people can think and plan!</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>But it will be as though God will shoot his arrows at them,</p><p>and suddenly they will be wounded.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Because of what they say [MTY], he will get rid of them,</p><p>and then everyone who sees what has happened to them will shake their heads to ridicule them.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>And then everyone will be afraid to sin because of what might happen to them, also;</p><p>they will tell others what God has done,</p><p>and they themselves will think much about it.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Righteous people should rejoice because of what Yahweh has done;</p><p>they should go to him to ◄find protection/be safe►;</p><p>and all those who are godly will praise him.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-65"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-65">65</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David for the choir director</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>God, it is right/appropriate for us to praise you in Jerusalem,</p><p>and to do what we have promised you that we would do,</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    because you answer our prayers.</p><p>People everywhere will come to you</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>because of the sins that they have committed.</p><p>Our many sins are like a very heavy burden to us,</p><p>but you forgive us.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>You are pleased with those whom you have chosen</p><p>to live close to your temple.</p><p>We are happy with all the blessings that we receive from worshiping in your sacred temple.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    God, when we pray to you, you answer us and save us by doing awesome deeds;</p><p>you are the one who rescues us;</p><p>people who live in very remote places on the earth, on the other side of the oceans, trust in you.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>By your strength you put the mountains in their places,</p><p>
    showing that you are very powerful.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>You calm the seas when they roar,</p><p>and you stop the waves from crashing on the shore;</p><p>you also calm people when they ◄make a great uproar/shout angrily together►.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>People who live in very remote/distant places on the earth</p><p>◄are awed by/revere► you because of the miracles that you perform;</p><p>because of what you do,</p><p>people who live far to the west and far to the east shout joyfully.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>You take care of the soil and send rain,</p><p>causing many good things to grow;</p><p>you fill the streams with water,</p><p>and cause grain/crops to grow.</p><p>That is what you have determined/said would happen.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>You send plenty of rain on the fields that have been plowed,</p><p>and you fill the furrows with water.</p><p>With showers you soften the hard clods/lumps of soil,</p><p>and you bless the soil by causing young plants to grow.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Because you bless the soil, there are very good crops at harvest season;</p><p>wherever you have gone [MTY], good crops are very abundant [IDM].</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>The pastures are full of flocks of sheep and goats;</p><p>
    it is as though the hills are very joyful.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>The meadows are full of sheep and goats,</p><p>and the valleys are full of grain;</p><p>

    <sup>1</sup>
    Tell everyone on the earth</p><p>that they should sing joyfully to praise God!</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>They should sing songs that say that God [MTY] is very great,</p><p>and they should tell everyone that he is very glorious!</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>They should say to God, “The things that you do are awesome!</p><p>You are very powerful,</p><p>with the result that your enemies ◄cringe/bow down► in front of you.”</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Everyone on the earth should worship God</p><p>and sing to praise him</p><p>and honor him [MTY].</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Come and think about what God has done!</p><p>Think about the awesome things that he has done.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>He caused the Red Sea to become dry land,</p><p>
    with the result that our ancestors were able to walk right through it.</p><p>There we rejoiced because of what he had done.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>By his great power he rules forever,</p><p>and he keeps watching all the nations to see what things they do,</p><p>
    so those nations that want to rebel against him should not be proud.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>You people of all nations, praise our God!</p><p>Praise him loudly in order that people will hear you as you praise him.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>He has kept us alive,</p><p>and he has not allowed us to ◄stumble/be defeated►.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>God, you have tested us;</p><p>you have allowed us to experience great difficulties to make our lives become pure</p><p>as people put precious metals in a hot fire to burn out what is impure [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    It is as if you allowed us to fall into traps [MET],</p><p>and you forced us to endure difficult things which were like putting heavy loads on our backs [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>You allowed our enemies to trample on us;</p><p>we experienced difficulties/troubles that were like [MET] walking through fires and floods,</p><p>but now you have brought us into a place where we have plenty.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    Yahweh, I will bring to your temple offerings that are to be completely burned on the altar;</p><p>I will offer to you what I promised.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>When I was experiencing much trouble, I said that I would bring offerings to you if you rescued me;</p><p>
    and you did rescue me, so I will bring to you what I promised.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>I will bring sheep to be burned on the altar,</p><p>and I will also sacrifice bulls and goats,</p><p>and when they are burning, you will be pleased when the smoke rises up ◄to you/to the sky►.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>All you people who revere God, come and listen,</p><p>and I will tell you what he has done for me.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>I called out to him to help me,</p><p>and I praised him while I was speaking to him [MTY].</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>If I had ignored the sins that I had committed,</p><p>the Lord would not have paid any attention to me.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>But because I confessed my sins, God has listened to me</p><p>and he paid attention to my prayers.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>I praise God</p><p>because he has not ignored my prayers</p><p>or stopped faithfully loving me.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-67"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-67">67</h3></a>

    <sup>4</sup>I desire that the people of all nations will be glad and sing joyfully,</p><p>because you judge the people-groups equally/justly,</p><p>and you guide all nations in the world.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>

<p>A psalm written by David for the choir director</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>God, arise and scatter your enemies,</p><p>and cause those who hate you to run away from you.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Like wind blows smoke away,</p><p>chase your enemies away.</p><p>Like wax melts when it is near a fire,</p><p>cause wicked people to ◄disappear/be destroyed►.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>But righteous people should be joyful;</p><p>they should rejoice when they are in God’s presence;</p><p>they should be happy, and be very joyful.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Sing to God; sing to praise him;</p><p>sing a song (OR, make a road) for him who rides on the clouds;</p><p>his name is Yahweh; be glad when you are in his presence.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>God, who lives in his sacred temple, is like [MET] a father to those who are orphans,</p><p>and he is the one who protects widows.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>For those who have no one to live with, he provides families to live with.</p><p>He frees prisoners and enables them to be successful,</p><p>but those who rebel against him will be forced to live in a very hot and dry land.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>God, you led your people out of Egypt,</p><p>and then you marched with them through the desert.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>After you did that, because when you, the God worshiped by us Israeli people, appeared to us at Sinai Mountain,,</p><p>the earth shook,</p><p>and rain poured down from the sky.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>You caused plenty of rain to fall on your land,</p><p>
    and so you enabled good crops to grow again on the land that you gave to us Israelis.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Your people built homes there;</p><p>and because you were good to them, you provided food for those who were poor.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>The Lord gave a message,</p><p>and many women took that message to other places.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    They proclaimed, “Many kings and their armies are running away from our army!”</p><p>
    When our army brought back to their homes the things that they captured,</p><p>the women who were at home divided up those things among themselves and among their families.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Even those women who were in the pens taking care of the sheep received some of those things;</p><p>they got statues of doves whose wings were covered with silver</p><p>and whose feathers were covered with pure yellow gold.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>When Almighty God scattered the enemy kings and their armies,</p><p>
    the number of weapons that they abandoned there seemed like there had been a snowstorm on Zalmon (OR, a black) Mountain.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>There is a very high mountain in the Bashan region,</p><p>a mountain which has many peaks.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>But the people who live near that mountain should not [RHQ] envy those who live near Zion,</p><p>the mountain on which God chose to live!</p><p>Yahweh will live there forever!</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    After we defeated all our enemies,</p><p>
    it was as though the Lord, surrounded by many thousands of strong chariots, descended from Sinai Mountain</p><p>and came into the sacred temple in Jerusalem.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>He ascended the sacred mountain where his temple is,</p><p>and took with him many people who had been captured in battles;</p><p>and received gifts from the enemies whom he had defeated.</p><p>He received gifts even from those who had rebelled against him,</p><p>and Yahweh our God will live there in his sacred temple forever.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Praise the Lord, who helps us carry our heavy loads every day;</p><p>he is the one who saves/rescues us.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>Our God is the God who saves us;</p><p>He is Yahweh, our Lord, the one who ◄allows us to escape/prevents us► from being killed in battles.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>But God will smash the heads of his enemies,</p><p>the skulls of those who continue to behave sinfully.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>The Lord said, “I will bring back the corpses of those who were killed in Bashan,</p><p>and I will bring back those who sank deep in the ocean and drowned.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>I will do that in order that you may wash your feet in their blood,</p><p>and your dogs can also lap up some of your enemies’ blood.”</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>God, many people see you march triumphantly into your sacred temple,</p><p>
    celebrating that you have defeated your enemies.</p><p>You march like a king does, and a large crowd walks with you.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>The singers are in front, and the people who play stringed instruments are at the rear,</p><p>and young women who are beating their tambourines are between them.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    They are all singing, “You Israeli people, praise God when you gather together;</p><p>praise Yahweh, all you who are descendants of Jacob!”</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>First come the people of the tribe of Benjamin, the smallest tribe,</p><p>and following them come the leaders of the tribe of Judah and their group,</p><p>and following them come the leaders of the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>God, show people that you are very powerful;</p><p>show people the power with which you have helped us previously.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>Show that power from your temple in Jerusalem,</p><p>where kings bring gifts to you.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>Rebuke your enemies, such as those in Egypt who are like wild hippopotamuses/animals that live in the reeds;</p><p>and powerful nations that are like bulls that are among their calves [MET];</p><p>rebuke/trample them until they bow down and give you gifts of silver.</p><p>Scatter the people who enjoy making wars.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>Then people will bring gifts of bronze (OR, of cloth) to you from Egypt;</p><p>the people in Ethiopia will lift up their hands to praise you.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>
    You people who are citizens of kingdoms/countries all over the world, sing to God!</p><p>Sing praises to the Lord!</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>Sing to the God, the one who rides across the sky,</p><p>the sky that he created long ago.</p><p>Listen as he shouts with a very powerful voice.</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>Proclaim that God is very powerful;</p><p>he is the king that rules over Israel,</p><p>and in the skies he also shows that he is powerful.</p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>God is awesome as he comes out of his sacred temple;</p><p>he is the God whom we Israeli people worship.</p><p>He makes [DOU] his people very powerful.</p><p>Praise God!</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-69"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-69">69</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David for the choir director</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>O God, save me,</p><p>because I am in great danger.</p><p>
    It is as though flood water is up to my neck, and I am about to drown [MET].</p><p>

    <sup>3</sup>I am exhausted from calling out for help;</p><p>my throat is very dry.</p><p>Because I have cried so much as I have waited for God to help me,</p><p>my eyes are swollen.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Those who hate me when there is no reason to hate me</p><p>are more than the number of hairs on my head [HYP]!</p><p>Those who want to get rid of me are strong,</p><p>and they tell lies about me.</p><p>They demand that I return to them things that I did not steal!</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>O God, ◄you see the sins that I have committed/my sins are not hidden from you►.</p><p>You know that I have foolishly disobeyed your laws.</p><p>

    <sup>7</sup>People have insulted/ridiculed me because I am devoted to you.</p><p>They have thoroughly humiliated [IDM] me.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Even my own older brothers act as if they do not know me;</p><p>they treat me like a foreigner.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    Some people have despised your temple;</p><p>but my zeal for keeping your temple holy is like a fire burning inside me.</p><p>So it is as though those who are insulting you are also insulting me.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>When I have humbled myself and ◄fasted/abstained from eating food►</p><p>
    to show my sadness about the disgraceful things that they have done to your temple,</p><p>they just insult me.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>When I put on rough sackcloth to show that I am sad,</p><p>they laugh at [IDM] me.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Even the elders of the city say bad things about me.</p><p>The drunkards of the city sing disgusting songs about me.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>But Yahweh, I will continue praying to you.</p><p>At the time that you choose, answer me and rescue me</p><p>because you faithfully love me.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>Do not allow me to sink any more in the mud.</p><p>Rescue me from those who hate me!</p><p>Lift me up out of these deep waters!</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>Do not allow flood waters to swirl around me,</p><p>do not allow the deep mud to swallow me;</p><p>keep me from sinking into the pit of death [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>O Yahweh, answer my prayer and help me</p><p>because you are good and love me faithfully.</p><p>

    <sup>18</sup>Come near to me and save me;</p><p>rescue me from my enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>You know that I am insulted</p><p>and that people cause me to feel ashamed and dishonored;</p><p>you know who all my enemies are.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    Their insults have deeply offended me,</p><p>and I ◄feel helpless/am in despair►.</p><p>I searched for someone who would pity me,</p><p>but there was no one.</p><p>I wanted someone to encourage/comfort me,</p><p>but there were none.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    Instead, they gave me food that tasted like poison,</p><p>and when I was thirsty, they gave me sour wine to drink.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>I hope/desire that the feasts [MTY] that they enjoy will ◄become a snare for/bring trouble to► them,</p><p>and that those whom they invite to the sacrificial feasts will also be trapped.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>I hope/desire that their eyesight will become dim so that they cannot see anything,</p><p>and that their backs/bodies will become weaker and weaker.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>Show them that you are very angry with them!</p><p>Because of your great/furious anger, chase after them and catch them.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>Cause their towns to become abandoned/deserted</p><p>and that there will be no one left to live in their tents/houses.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    Do this because they persecute those whom you have punished,</p><p>◄they talk about the sins of/they want to hurt even more► those whom you have wounded.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>Keep making a record of all their sins,</p><p>do not acquit/pardon them for the evil things that they have done.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>Erase their names [SYN] from the book containing the names of those who have eternal life;</p><p>do not include them in the list of righteous people.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>As for me, I have pain and am suffering.</p><p>O God, protect me and rescue me.</p><p>

    <sup>1</sup>God, please save me!</p><p>Yahweh, come quickly to help me!</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Humble those who are happy about my troubles/difficulties, and cause them to be disgraced/ashamed.</p><p>Chase away those who are trying to kill me.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>I hope/desire that you will cause them to become dismayed and ashamed</p><p>
    because you have defeated them.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    But I hope/desire that all those who go to worship you will be very joyful [DOU].</p><p>I want those who love you because you saved them to shout repeatedly [HYP],</p><p>“God is great!”</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>As for me, I am poor and needy [DOU];</p><p>

    so please come quickly!</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-71"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-71">71</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh, I have come to you to ◄get refuge/be protected►;</p><p>never allow me to become ashamed because of being defeated.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Because you always do what is right, help me and rescue me;</p><p>listen to me, and save me!</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Be like an overhanging rock [MET] under which I can be safe/protected;</p><p>
    be like a strong fortress in which I am safe [DOU].</p><p>You continually command (OR, Continually command) your angels to rescue me.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>God, rescue me from wicked people,</p><p>from the power of unjust and evil men.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Yahweh, my Lord, you are the one whom I confidently expect to help me;</p><p>I have trusted in you since I was young.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>I have depended on you all my life;</p><p>you have taken care of me [IDM] since the day that I was born,</p><p>
    so I will always praise you.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>The manner in which I have conducted my life has been an example to many people,</p><p>because they realize that you have been my strong defender.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>I praise you all day long,</p><p>and I proclaim that you are glorious/wonderful.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Now, when I have become an old man, do not reject/abandon me;</p><p>do not abandon me now, when I am not strong any more.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>My enemies say that they want to kill me;</p><p>they plan together how they can do that.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>They say about me, “God has abandoned him;</p><p>so now we can pursue him and seize him,</p><p>because there is no one who will rescue him.”</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>God, do not stay far away from me;</p><p>hurry to help me!</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Cause those who ◄accuse me/say that I have done things that are wrong► to be defeated and destroyed;</p><p>cause those who want to harm me to be shamed and disgraced.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>But as for me, I will continually and confidently expect you to do great things for me,</p><p>and I will praise you more and more.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>I will tell people that you do what is right;</p><p>all day long I will tell people how you have saved me,</p><p>although what you have done is more than I can fully understand.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>Yahweh, my Lord, I will praise you for your mighty deeds;</p><p>I will proclaim that only you always act justly.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>God, you have taught me many/those things ever since I was young,</p><p>and I still tell people about your wonderful deeds.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>And now, God, when I am old and my hair is gray,</p><p>do not abandon me.</p><p>
    Stay with me while I continue to proclaim to my children and grandchildren [HYP] that you are very powerful!</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>God, you do many righteous deeds;</p><p>
    it is as though they extend up to the sky.</p><p>You have done great things;</p><p>there is no one like you [RHQ].</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>You have caused me to have many troubles and to suffer much,</p><p>
    but you will cause me to become strong again;</p><p>when I am almost dead [HYP], you will keep me alive.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>You will cause me to be greatly honored</p><p>and you will encourage/comfort me again.</p><p>

    <sup>24</sup>All day long I will tell people that you act righteously,</p><p>because those who wanted to harm me will have been defeated and disgraced.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-72"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-72">72</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by Solomon.</p><p>A prayer for God to bless the king</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>O God, enable me, the king whom you appointed in Israel, to rule justly.</p><p>Show/Teach me how to judge matters fairly</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>in order that I will judge your people fairly,</p><p>that I will govern your oppressed people justly.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>I desire that all over the country—even on the hills and mountains [DOU]—</p><p>people will live peacefully and righteously.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Help me, your king, to defend the poor people</p><p>and to rescue needy people and to defeat those who oppress them.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>I desire that your people will revere you as long as the moon shines, forever.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>I desire that my rule will be enjoyed by the people [SIM]</p><p>like they enjoy rain on growing crops,</p><p>like they enjoy showers that fall on the land.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>I hope/desire that people will live righteously during the years that I rule,</p><p>and that my people will live peacefully and prosperously as long as the moon shines.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>I hope/desire that the kings of Israel will rule the people</p><p>in all the area from one sea in the east to another in the west,</p><p>and from the Euphrates River to the most remote/distant places on earth.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>I hope/desire that those who live in the desert will bow down before them,</p><p>and that their enemies will throw themselves on the ground in submission to them.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>I hope/desire that the kings of Spain and of the islands in the Mediterranean Sea will bring ◄tribute money/taxes► to the kings of Israel,</p><p>and that the kings of Sheba to the south and of Seba to the southwest will bring them gifts.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>I hope/desire that all the other kings in the world will bow before the kings of Israel,</p><p>and that people of all nations will serve them.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>They will rescue poor people when they ◄cry out/plead► for help,</p><p>and help those who are needy and those who have no one to help them.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>They will pity those who are weak and needy;</p><p>he saves the people’s lives.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>Our kings will rescue the people from being oppressed and from being treated cruelly,</p><p>
    because ◄their lives/they► [MTY] are precious to our kings.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>I hope/desire that our kings will live a long time!</p><p>I hope/desire that they will be given gold from Sheba.</p><p>I desire that people will always pray for our kings</p><p>and praise them all the time, every day.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>I hope/desire that the fields will produce plenty of grain everywhere, even on the tops of the hills in the land where they rule,</p><p>like the grain that grows on the hills in Lebanon.</p><p>I hope/desire that the cities in Israel will be full of people</p><p>like the fields are full of grass.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>I desire that the names of our kings will never be forgotten.</p><p>I hope/desire that people will remember them as long as the sun shines.</p><p>I hope/desire that people of all nations will ask ◄God to bless them/that they will be blessed by God►</p><p>just like he has blessed the kings of Israel.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>Praise Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis worship;</p><p>he is the only one who does wonderful things.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Praise him forever!</p><p>I desire that ◄his glory will fill the whole world/people all over the world may see that he is very great► [MTY]!</p><p>Amen! May it be so!</p><p>

<p>Book Three</p><p>A psalm written by Asaph</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>God truly is good to us Israeli people,</p><p>to those who totally want to do all that God desires.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>As for me, I almost stopped trusting in God;</p><p>
    it was as though my feet slipped and I stumbled [MET],</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>because I envied those who proudly said that they did not need God,</p><p>and I saw that they prospered even though they were wicked.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Those people do not have any pains;</p><p>they are always strong and healthy.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>They do not have the troubles/difficulties that other people have;</p><p>they do not have problems like others do.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>So they are proud, and their being proud is like a necklace that they show to others,</p><p>and they show off their violent actions like people show off their beautiful robes.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>From their inner beings they ◄pour out/do► evil deeds,</p><p>and they are always thinking about more evil things to do.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>They scoff at other people, and they talk about doing evil things to them;</p><p>they are proud while they plan to oppress others.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>They say evil things about God who is in heaven [MTY],</p><p>and they talk boastfully/proudly about things that they have done here on the earth.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>The result is that people listen to what they say and praise them</p><p>and do not think that they have done anything that is wrong.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Wicked people say to themselves, “God will certainly not [RHQ] know what we have done;</p><p>
    people say that he is greater than any other god, but he does not know everything.”</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>That is what wicked people are like;</p><p>they never worry about anything, and they are always becoming richer.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    So, God, I think it is useless that I have [RHQ] always done what you want me to,</p><p>and that I have not sinned.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>All day long I have problems,</p><p>and every morning you punish me.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>If I had said the things that the wicked people say,</p><p>I would have been sinning against your people.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>And when I tried to think about all this,</p><p>it was very difficult for me to understand it.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>But when I went to your temple, you spoke to me,</p><p>and I understood what will happen to the wicked people after they die.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    Now I know that you will surely put them in slippery places,</p><p>and they will fall down and die.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>They will be destroyed instantly;</p><p>they will die in terrible ways.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>They will disappear as quickly as a dream disappears when a person awakes in the morning;</p><p>Lord, when you arise, you will ◄cause them to disappear/forget all about them►.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>When I felt sad/bitter,</p><p>and brokenhearted,</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>I was stupid and ignorant,</p><p>and I behaved like an animal toward you.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>But I am always close to you,</p><p>and you hold my hand.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>You guide me by teaching me,</p><p>and ◄at the end of my life/when I die►, you will receive me and honor me.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>You are in heaven and I belong to you [RHQ],</p><p>and there is nothing on this earth that I desire more than that.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>My body and my mind may become very weak,</p><p>but God, you continue to enable me to be strong;</p><p>I belong to you forever.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>Those who remain far from you will be destroyed;</p><p>you will get rid of those who abandon you.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>But as for me, it is wonderful to be near to God</p><p>and to be protected by Yahweh,</p><p>and to proclaim to others all that he has done for me.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-74"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-74">74</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by Asaph</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>God, why have you abandoned/rejected us?</p><p>Will you keep rejecting us forever [RHQ]?</p><p>Why are you angry with us,</p><p>since we are like sheep in your pasture and you are like our shepherd? [MET, RHQ]</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Do not forget your people whom you chose long ago,</p><p>the people whom you freed from being slaves in Egypt and caused to become your tribe.</p><p>Do not forget Jerusalem, which was ◄your home/where you dwelt► on this earth.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Walk along and see where everything has been totally ruined;</p><p>our enemies have destroyed everything in the sacred temple.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Your enemies shouted triumphantly in this sacred place;</p><p>they erected their banners to show they had defeated us.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>They cut down all the engraved objects in the temple like woodsmen cut down trees.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Then they smashed all the carved wood with their axes and hammers.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    Then they burned your temple to the ground;</p><p>they caused that place where you were worshiped to be unfit for people to worship in.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>They said to themselves, “We will destroy the Israelis completely,”</p><p>and they also burned down all the other places where we gathered to worship God.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>All our sacred symbols (OR, miracles) are gone;</p><p>there are no prophets now/any more,</p><p>and no one knows how long this situation will continue.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>God, how long will our enemies make fun of you [RHQ]?</p><p>Will they insult you [MTY] forever [RHQ]?</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Why do you refuse to help [MTY, RHQ] us?</p><p>Why do you keep your hand inside your cloak instead of using it to destroy our enemies [RHQ]?</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>God, you have been our king all the time since we came out of Egypt [HYP],</p><p>and you have enabled us to defeat our enemies in the land of Israel.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>By your power you caused the Red Sea to divide;</p><p>
    it was as though you smashed the heads of the rulers of Egypt who were like huge sea dragons [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    It was as though you crushed the head of the king of Egypt [MET]</p><p>and gave his body to the animals in the desert to eat.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>You caused springs and streams to flow,</p><p>and you also dried up rivers that had never dried up previously.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>You created the days and the nights,</p><p>and you put the sun and the moon in their places.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>You determined where the oceans end and the land begins,</p><p>and you created the summer/hot season and the winter/cold season.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>Yahweh, do not forget that your enemies laugh at you,</p><p>and that it is foolish people who despise you [MTY].</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Do not let your helpless people [MET] fall into the hands of their cruel enemies;</p><p>do not forget your suffering/persecuted people.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>Do not forget the agreement that you made with us;</p><p>remember that there are violent people in every dark place on the earth.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>Do not allow your oppressed people to be disgraced;</p><p>help those poor and needy people in order that they will again praise you [MTY].</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>God, arise and defend yourself by defending your people!</p><p>Do not forget that foolish people laugh at you ◄all day long/continually►!</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>Do not forget that your enemies shout angrily at you;</p><p>the uproar that they make while they oppose you never stops.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-75"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-75">75</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by Asaph for the choir director, to be sung using the tune ‘Do not destroy’</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>We give thanks to you;</p><p>our God, we thank you.</p><p>You are close to us,</p><p>and we proclaim to others the wonderful things that you have done for us.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    You have said, “I have appointed a time when I will judge people,</p><p>and I will judge everyone fairly.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>When the earth shakes</p><p>and all the creatures on the earth tremble,</p><p>I am the one who will ◄keep its foundations steady/prevent it from being destroyed►.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>I say to people who ◄boast/talk proudly about themselves►, ‘Stop bragging!’</p><p>and I say to wicked people, ‘Do not proudly do things to show how great you are [IDM]!</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Do not be arrogant,</p><p>and do not speak so boastfully!’”</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>The one who judges people does not come from the east or from the west,</p><p>and he does not come from the desert.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>God is the one who judges people;</p><p>he says that some have sinned and must be punished, and that others have not done what is wrong.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    It is as though Yahweh holds a cup in his hand;</p><p>it is filled with wine that has spices mixed in it to cause those who drink it to become more drunk;</p><p>and when Yahweh pours it out, he will force all the wicked people to drink it;</p><p>they will drink every drop of it,</p><p>
    which means that he will give them all the punishment that they deserve.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>But as for me, I will never stop saying what the God whom Jacob worshiped has done;</p><p>I will never quit singing to praise him.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>He will destroy the power [IDM] of wicked people,</p><p>but he will cause righteous people to become more powerful.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-76"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-76">76</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by Asaph for the choir director, to be accompanied by stringed instruments</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>People in Judah know God;</p><p>the Israeli people honor him [MTY].</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>His home is in Jerusalem;</p><p>he lives on Zion Hill.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>There he broke the flaming arrows that his enemies shot,</p><p>
    and he also broke their shields and swords and other weapons that they used in battles.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>God, you are glorious!</p><p>You are like a king as you return from the mountains where you defeated your enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Their brave soldiers were killed, and then those who killed them took away everything that those soldiers had.</p><p>Those enemies died [EUP],</p><p>
    so they were unable to use their weapons any more!</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>When you, the God whom Jacob worshiped, rebuked your enemies,</p><p>
    the result was that their horses and their riders fell down dead.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>But you cause everyone to be afraid.</p><p>When you are angry and you punish people, no one can [RHQ] endure it.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>From heaven you proclaimed that you would judge people,</p><p>
    and then everyone on the earth was afraid and did not say anything more,</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>when you arose to declare that you would punish wicked people</p><p>and rescue all those whom they had oppressed.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>When you punish those with whom you are angry, your people will praise you,</p><p>and your enemies who ◄survive/are not killed► will worship you on your festival days.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    So give to Yahweh the offerings that you promised to give to him;</p><p>all the people of nearby people-groups should also bring gifts to him, the one who is awesome.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>He humbles [IDM] princes,</p><p>and even causes great kings to be terrified.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-77"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-77">77</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by Asaph for Jeduthun, the choir director</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>I cry out to God;</p><p>I cry aloud to him, and he hears me.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Whenever have trouble, I pray to the Lord;</p><p>all during the night I lift up my hands while I pray,</p><p>
    but nothing causes me to be comforted.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>When I think about God, I ◄despair/think that he will never help me►;</p><p>when I meditate about him, I am discouraged.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    All during the night he prevents me from sleeping;</p><p>I am very worried, with the result that I do not know what to say.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>I think about days that have passed;</p><p>I remember what happened in previous years.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>I spend the whole night thinking about things;</p><p>I meditate, and this is what I ask myself:</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>“Will the Lord always reject us?</p><p>Will he never again be pleased with us?</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Has he stopped faithfully loving us?</p><p>Will he not do for us what he promised to do?</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>God promised to be merciful to us; has he forgotten that?</p><p>Because he is angry with us, has he decided to not be kind to us?”</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Then I said, “What causes me to be very sad is that</p><p>
    it seems that God, who is greater than any other god, is no longer powerful.”</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    But then, Yahweh, I recall/remember your great deeds;</p><p>I remember the wonderful things that you did in the past.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>I meditate on all that you have done,</p><p>and I think about your mighty acts.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>God, everything that you do is holy;</p><p>there is certainly no god [RHQ] who is great like you are!</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>You are God, the one who performs miracles;</p><p>you showed to people of many people-groups that you are powerful.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>By your power [MTY] you rescued your people from Egypt;</p><p>you saved those who were descendants of Jacob and his son Joseph.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    It was as though the waters of the Red Sea saw you and became very afraid,</p><p>and even the deepest part of the water shook.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Rain poured down from the clouds [PRS];</p><p>it thundered very loudly [PRS],</p><p>and lightning flashed in all directions.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>Thunder crashed in the whirlwind,</p><p>and lightning ◄lit up/flashed across► the entire sky [HYP];</p><p>the earth shook violently [DOU].</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    Then you walked through the sea</p><p>on a path that you made through the deep water,</p><p>but your footprints could not be seen.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>You led your people like a shepherd leads his flock of sheep,</p><p>while Moses and Aaron were the leaders of your people.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-78"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-78">78</h3></a>

    <sup>1</sup>My friends, listen to what I am going to teach you;</p><p>pay careful attention [IDM] to what I say.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>I am going to give you some sayings that wise people have said.</p><p>They will be sayings about things that happened long ago,</p><p>things that were difficult to understand [MET],</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>things that we have heard and known previously,</p><p>things that our parents and grandparents told us.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>We will tell these things to our children [LIT],</p><p>and we will also tell to our grandchildren</p><p>
    about Yahweh’s power and the glorious/great things that he has done.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>He gave laws and commandments to the Israeli people,</p><p>
    those who are the descendants of Jacob [DOU],</p><p>and he told our ancestors to teach them to their children</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>in order that their children would also know them</p><p>and then they would teach them to their children.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>In that way, they also would trust in God,</p><p>and not forget the things that he has done;</p><p>instead, they would obey his commandments.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>They would not be like their ancestors,</p><p>who were very stubborn and kept rebelling against God;</p><p>they did not continue firmly trusting in God,</p><p>and they did not worship only him.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    The soldiers of the tribe of Ephraim had bows and arrows</p><p>but they ran away from their enemies on the day that they fought a battle with their enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>They did not do what they had agreed with God that they would do;</p><p>they refused to obey his laws.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>They forgot what he had done;</p><p>they forgot about the miracles that they had seen him perform.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>While our ancestors were watching,</p><p>God performed miracles in the area around Zoan city in Egypt.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    Then he caused the Red Sea to divide,</p><p>causing the water on each side to pile up like a wall,</p><p>with the result that our ancestors walked through it on dry ground.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>He led them by a bright cloud during the day</p><p>and by a fiery light during the night.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>He split rocks open in the desert,</p><p>giving to our ancestors plenty of water from deep inside the earth.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>He caused a stream of water to flow from the rock;</p><p>the water flowed like a river [DOU].</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>But our ancestors continued to sin against God;</p><p>in the desert they rebelled against the one who is greater than any other god.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>By demanding that God give them the food that they desired,</p><p>they tried to find out if he would always do what they requested him to do.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>They insulted God by saying, “We don’t think he can supply food for us here in this desert!</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    It is true that he struck the rock,</p><p>with the result that water gushed/flowed out,</p><p>
    but ◄can he also provide bread and meat for us, his people?/we doubt that he can also provide bread and meat for us, his people.►” [RHQ]</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>So, when Yahweh heard that, he became very angry,</p><p>and he sent a fire to burn up some of his Israeli people. [MTY, DOU]</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    He did that because they did not trust in him,</p><p>and they did not believe that he would rescue them.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>But God spoke to the sky above them;</p><p>he commanded it to open like a door,</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>and then food fell down like rain,</p><p>
    food which they named ‘manna’;</p><p>God gave them grain from ◄heaven/the sky►.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    So the people ate the food that angels eat,</p><p>
    and God gave to them all the manna that they wanted.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    Later, he caused the wind to blow from the east,</p><p>and by his power he also sent wind from the south,</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>and the wind brought birds</p><p>which were as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>God caused those birds to fall dead in the middle of ◄their camp►/the area where the people had put up their tents.</p><p>
    There were dead birds all around their tents.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>
    So the people cooked the birds and ate the meat and their stomachs were full,</p><p>because God had given them what they wanted.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>But before they had eaten all that they wanted,</p><p>and while they were still eating it,</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>God was still very angry with them,</p><p>and he caused their strongest men to die;</p><p>he got rid of many of the finest young Israeli men.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>In spite of all that, the people continued to sin;</p><p>in spite of all the miracles that God had performed,</p><p>they still did not trust that he would take care of them.</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>So, he caused their lives to end as quickly as a puff of wind ends;</p><p>they died when disasters suddenly struck them.</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>When God caused some of them to die,</p><p>
    the others turned to God;</p><p>they repented and earnestly asked God to save them.</p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>They remembered that God is like a huge rock ledge under which they would be safe [MET],</p><p>and that he, who was greater than any other god, is the one who protected/rescued them.</p><p>
    <sup>36</sup>But they tried to deceive God by what they said [MTY];</p><p>their words [MTY] were all lies.</p><p>
    <sup>37</sup>They were not loyal to him;</p><p>they disregarded/ignored the agreement that he had made with them.</p><p>
    <sup>38</sup>But God was merciful to his people.</p><p>He forgave them for having sinned</p><p>and did not get rid of them.</p><p>Many times he refrained from becoming angry with them</p><p>and restrained from furiously/severely punishing them [MTY].</p><p>
    <sup>39</sup>He remembered/considered that they were only humans who die;</p><p>they disappear quickly [SIM], like a wind that blows by and then is gone.</p><p>
    <sup>40</sup>Many times our ancestors rebelled against God in the desert</p><p>and caused him to become very sad.</p><p>
    <sup>41</sup>Many times they did evil things, to find out if they could do those things without God punishing them.</p><p>They frequently caused the holy God of Israel to become disgusted/sad.</p><p>
    <sup>42</sup>They forgot about his great power,</p><p>and they ◄forgot/did not think► about the time when he rescued them from their enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>43</sup>They forgot about when he performed many miracles</p><p>in the area near Zoan city in Egypt.</p><p>
    <sup>44</sup>He caused the Nile River (OR, their sources of water) to become red like blood,</p><p>with the result that the people of Egypt had no water to drink.</p><p>
    <sup>45</sup>He sent among the people of Egypt swarms of flies that bit them,</p><p>and he sent frogs that ate up everything.</p><p>
    <sup>46</sup>He sent locusts to eat their crops</p><p>and the other things that grew in their fields.</p><p>
    <sup>47</sup>He sent hail that destroyed the grapevines,</p><p>and sent frost that ruined the figs.</p><p>
    <sup>48</sup>He sent hail that killed their cattle</p><p>and sent lightning that killed their sheep and cows.</p><p>
    <sup>49</sup>Because God was fiercely angry with the people of Egypt,</p><p>he caused them to be very distressed.</p><p>The disasters that struck them were like a group of angels that destroyed everything.</p><p>
    <sup>50</sup>He did not lessen his being angry with them,</p><p>and he did not ◄spare their lives/prevent them from dying►;</p><p>he sent a ◄plague/serious illness► that killed many of them.</p><p>
    <sup>51</sup>He also caused all the firstborn sons of the people of Egypt to die.</p><p>
    <sup>52</sup>Then he led his people out of Egypt like a shepherd leads his sheep [SIM],</p><p>and he guided them while they walked through the desert.</p><p>
    <sup>53</sup>He led them safely, and they were not afraid,</p><p>but their enemies were drowned in the sea.</p><p>
    <sup>54</sup>
    Later he brought them to Canaan, his sacred land,</p><p>to Zion Hill (OR, the hilly area)</p><p>and by his power [MTY] he enabled them to conquer the people who were living there.</p><p>
    <sup>55</sup>He expelled the people-groups while his people were advancing;</p><p>he allotted part of the land for each tribe to possess,</p><p>and he gave to the Israeli people the houses of those people who had been expelled.</p><p>
    <sup>56</sup>However, the Israeli people rebelled against God, who is greater than any other god,</p><p>and they did many evil things to see if they could do those things without God punishing them,</p><p>and they did not obey his commandments.</p><p>
    <sup>57</sup>Instead, like their ancestors did, they rebelled against God and ◄were not loyal to/did not faithfully obey► him;</p><p>they were as unreliable as a crooked arrow that does not go straight [SIM].</p><p>
    <sup>58</sup>Because they worshiped carved images of their gods on the tops of hills,</p><p>they caused God to become angry [DOU].</p><p>
    <sup>59</sup>He saw what they were doing and became very angry,</p><p>so he rejected the Israeli people.</p><p>
    <sup>60</sup>He no longer appeared to them at Shiloh</p><p>in the tent where he had lived among them.</p><p>
    <sup>61</sup>He allowed their enemies to capture the sacred chest,</p><p>
    which was the symbol of his power and his glory.</p><p>
    <sup>62</sup>Because he was angry with his people,</p><p>he allowed them to be killed [MTY] by their enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>63</sup>Young men were killed in battles,</p><p>with the result that the young women had no one to marry.</p><p>
    <sup>64</sup>
    Many priests were killed by their enemies’ swords,</p><p>and ◄the people did not allow the priests’ widows/the priests’ widows were not allowed► to mourn.</p><p>
    <sup>65</sup>Later, it was as though the Lord awoke from sleeping;</p><p>he was like a strong man who ◄became stimulated/felt that he was strong► by (OR, became sober after) drinking a lot of wine [SIM].</p><p>
    <sup>66</sup>He pushed their enemies back</p><p>and caused them to be very ashamed for a long time [HYP]</p><p>
    because they had been defeated.</p><p>
    <sup>67</sup>
    But he did not set up his tent where the people of the tribe of Ephraim lived;</p><p>he did not choose their area to do that.</p><p>
    <sup>68</sup>Instead he chose the area where the tribe of Judah lived;</p><p>he chose Zion Hill, which he loves.</p><p>
    <sup>69</sup>He decided to have his temple built there, high up, like his home in heaven;</p><p>he caused it to be firm,</p><p>
    and intended that his temple would last forever, like the earth.</p><p>
    <sup>70</sup>He chose David, who served him faithfully,</p><p>and took him from the pastures</p><p>
    <sup>71</sup>where he was taking care of his father’s sheep,</p><p>and appointed him to be the leader [MET] of the Israeli people,</p><p>the people who belong to God.</p><p>
    <sup>72</sup>David took care of the Israeli people sincerely and wholeheartedly,</p><p>and guided them skillfully/wisely.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-79"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-79">79</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by Asaph</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>God, other people-groups have invaded your land.</p><p>They have ◄desecrated your temple/caused your temple to be unfit for worship►,</p><p>and they have destroyed all the buildings in Jerusalem.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    Instead of burying the corpses of your people whom they killed,</p><p>they allowed vultures and wild animals to eat the flesh of those corpses,</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>When they killed your people,</p><p>your people’s blood flowed like water through the streets of Jerusalem,</p><p>and there was almost no one [HYP] left to bury their corpses.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>The people-groups that live in countries that surround our land insult us;</p><p>they laugh at us and deride/belittle us.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Yahweh, how long will this continue?</p><p>Will you be angry with us forever?</p><p>Will your being angry destroy us like a burning fire destroys things?</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    Instead of being angry with us,</p><p>be angry with the people-groups that do not know/worship you!</p><p>Be angry with kingdoms whose people do not pray to you,</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>because they have killed Israeli people</p><p>and they have ruined your country.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Do not punish us because of the sins that our ancestors committed!</p><p>Be merciful to us now/quickly,</p><p>because we are very discouraged.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>God, you have saved/rescued us many times,</p><p>
    so help us now;</p><p>rescue us and forgive us for having sinned</p><p>in order that other people will honor you [MTY].</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>It is not right that [RHQ] other people-groups say about us,</p><p>“If their God is very powerful, ◄surely he should help them/why does he not help them►?”</p><p>Allow us to see you punishing the people of other nations in return for their shedding our blood;</p><p>they have killed many of us, your people.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Listen to your people groaning while they are in prison,</p><p>and by your great power free those whom our enemies say that they will certainly execute.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>In return for their having often insulted you,</p><p>punish them seven times as much!</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>After you do that, we, whom you take care of like a shepherd takes care of his sheep, will continue praising you;</p><p>we will continue to praise you forever [HYP].</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-80"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-80">80</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by Asaph for the choir director, to be sung using the tune ‘Lilies of the covenant’</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Yahweh, you who lead us like a shepherd leads his flock of sheep,</p><p>listen to us Israeli people.</p><p>You sit on your throne in the Very Holy Place in the temple, above the carvings of winged creatures.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Show yourself to the people of the tribes of Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh!</p><p>Show us that you are powerful</p><p>and come and rescue us!</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>God, cause our nation to be strong like it was before;</p><p>be kind to us [IDM] in order that we may be saved from our enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Yahweh, you who are the commander of the armies of heaven,</p><p>how long will you be angry with us, your people, when we pray to you?</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    It is as though the only food and drink that you have given us is a cup full of our tears!</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>You have allowed the people-groups that surround us to fight with each other to decide which part of our land each of them will take;</p><p>our enemies laugh at us.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>God, commander of the armies of heaven,</p><p>cause our nation to be strong like it was before!</p><p>Be kind to us in order that we may be saved!</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    Our ancestors were like a grapevine [MET] that you brought out of Egypt;</p><p>you expelled the other people-groups from this land,</p><p>and you put your people in their land.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    Like people clear ground to plant a grapevine [MET],</p><p>
    you cleared out the people who were living in this land for us to live in it.</p><p>
    Like the roots of a grapevine go deep down into the ground and spread [MET],</p><p>
    you enabled our ancestors to prosper and start living in towns all over this land.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    Like huge grapevines cover the hills with their shade</p><p>and their branches are taller than big cedar trees [MET, HYP],</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    your people ruled all of Canaan, from the Mediterranean Sea in the west to the Euphrates River in the east.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>So why have you abandoned us</p><p>and allowed our enemies to tear down our walls [RHQ]?</p><p>
    You are like someone who tears down the fences around his vineyard,</p><p>with the result that all the people who pass by can steal the grapes,</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>and wild pigs can trample the vines,</p><p>and wild animals can also eat the grapes.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>You who are the commander of the armies of heaven, ◄turn to/stop abandoning► us!</p><p>Look down from heaven and see what is happening to us!</p><p>Come and rescue us who are like [MET] your grapevine,</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>who are like the young vine that you [SYN] planted and caused to grow!</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>Our enemies have torn down and burned everything in our land;</p><p>look at them angrily and get rid of them!</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>But strengthen us people whom you have chosen [IDM],</p><p>
    us Israeli people whom you previously caused to be very strong.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>When you do that, we will never turn away from you again;</p><p>◄revive us/cause us to be again like we were previously►, and then we will praise/worship you.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Yahweh, commander of the armies of heaven, restore us;</p><p>be kind to us in order that we may be rescued from our enemies!</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-81"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-81">81</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by Asaph for the choir director</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Sing songs to praise God, who enables us to be strong when we fight our enemies;</p><p>shout joyfully to God, whom we ◄descendants of Jacob/Israeli people► worship!</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Start playing the music, and beat the tambourines,</p><p>and play nice music on the harps and ◄lyres/other stringed instruments►.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Blow the trumpets during the festival to celebrate each new moon</p><p>and each time the moon is full and during our other festivals.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    Do that because that is a law for us Israeli people;</p><p>God commanded it for us descendants of Jacob.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>He commanded us Israeli people to obey it when he punished the people of Egypt.</p><p>I heard someone [MTY] whose voice I did not recognize, saying,</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>“After the rulers of Egypt forced you Israelis to work as slaves,</p><p>I took those heavy burdens off your backs,</p><p>and I enabled you to lay down those heavy baskets of bricks that you were carrying.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>When you were greatly distressed, you called out to me, and I rescued you;</p><p>I answered you out of a thundercloud.</p><p>
    Later I tested whether you would trust me to give you water when you were in the desert at Meribah.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    You who are my people, listen while I warn you!</p><p>I wish that you Israeli people would pay attention to what I say to you!</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>You must not have any idols of other gods among you;</p><p>you must never bow to worship any of them!</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>I am Yahweh, your God;</p><p>It was not any of those other gods who brought you out of Egypt,</p><p>I am the one who did it!</p><p>
    So ask me what you want me to do for you [MTY], and I will do it.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>But my people would not listen to me [SYN];</p><p>they would not obey me.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>So even though they were very stubborn,</p><p>I allowed them to do whatever they wanted to do.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>I wish that my people would listen to me,</p><p>that the Israeli people would behave as I want them to do.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    If they did that, I would quickly defeat their enemies;</p><p>I would strike/punish all of them [DOU].</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    Then all those who hate me would ◄cringe before/bow down to► me,</p><p>and then I would punish them [MTY] forever.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    But I would give you Israelis very good wheat/grain,</p><p>and I would fill your stomachs with wild honey.”</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-82"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-82">82</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by Asaph</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>God gathers all the rulers and judges who think they are gods for a meeting in heaven;</p><p>and he tells them that he has decided this:</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>“You must [RHQ] stop judging people unfairly;</p><p>you must no longer make decisions that favor wicked people!</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>You must defend people who are poor and orphans;</p><p>you must act fairly toward those who are needy and those who have no one to help them.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Rescue them from the power [MTY] of evil people [DOU]!”</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Those rulers do not know or understand anything!</p><p>They are very corrupt/evil,</p><p>and as a result of their corrupt/evil behavior,</p><p>
    it is as though the foundation of the world is being shaken!</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>I the all-powerful God, previously said to them, “You think you are gods!</p><p>
    It is as though you are all my sons,</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>but you will die like people do;</p><p>your lives will end, like the lives of all rulers end.”</p><p>

<p>A psalm which is a song written by Asaph</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>God, do not continue to be silent!</p><p>Do not be quiet and say nothing,</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>because your enemies are rioting against you;</p><p>those who hate you are rebelling against you!</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>They are secretly planning to do things to harm us, your people;</p><p>they are ◄conspiring together against/planning how to defeat► the people whom you protect.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>They say, “Come, we must destroy their nation,</p><p>with the result that no one will remember that Israel ever existed!”</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>They have agreed on what they want to do to destroy Israel,</p><p>and they have formed an alliance against you.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    The people who have done that are the people of Edom region,</p><p>the descendants of Ishmael who live on the east side of the Jordan River,</p><p>the Moab people-group, the descendants of Hagar who also live on the east side of the Jordan River,</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Gebal people-group, the Ammon people-group, the Amalek people-group,</p><p>the Philistia people-group, and the people of Tyre city.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    The people of Assyria have joined them;</p><p>they are strong allies of the Moab and Ammon people-groups, who are descendants of Abraham’s nephew Lot.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    God, do to those people things like you did to the Midian people-group,</p><p>like you did to Sisera and Jabin at Kishon River.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>You destroyed them at Endor town,</p><p>and their corpses lay on the ground and decayed.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Do to them things like you did to Kings Oreb and Zeeb;</p><p>defeat their leaders like you defeated Zebah and Zalmunna,</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>who said, “We will take for ourselves the land that the Israelis say belongs to God!”</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>My God, cause them to disappear quickly like whirling dust,</p><p>like chaff that the wind blows away!</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>Like a fire completely burns a forest</p><p>and like flames burn in the mountains,</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>expel them by sending storms;</p><p>cause them to be terrified by your big storms/hurricanes!</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>Cause them [SYN] to be very ashamed</p><p>in order that they will admit that you are very powerful.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Cause them to be forever disgraced because of being defeated,</p><p>and cause them to die while they are still disgraced.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>Cause them to know that you, whose name is Yahweh,</p><p>are the supreme ruler over everything on the earth.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-84"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-84">84</h3></a>

    <sup>1</sup>Lord, you who are the Commander of the armies of angels,</p><p>your temple is very beautiful!</p><p>

    you cause it to become a place where there are springs of water,</p><p>where the rains ◄in the autumn/before the cold season► fill the valley with pools of water.</p><p>

    For me, spending one day in your temple</p><p>is better than spending 1,000 days somewhere else;</p><p>

<p>A psalm written by one of the descendants of Korah for the choir director</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh, you have been kind to us people who live in this land;</p><p>you have enabled us Israeli people to become prosperous again.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>You forgave us, your people, for the sins that we had committed;</p><p>you pardoned us for all our sins [DOU].</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>You stopped being angry with us</p><p>and turned away from severely punishing us.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Now, God, the one who saves/rescues us, ◄restore us/make us prosperous again►</p><p>and stop being angry with us!</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>◄Will you continue to be angry with us forever?/Please do not continue to be angry with us forever.► [DOU, RHQ]</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Please enable us [RHQ] to prosper again</p><p>in order that we, your people, will rejoice about what you have done for us.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Yahweh, by rescuing us from our troubles/difficulties,</p><p>show us that you faithfully love us.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>I want to listen to what Yahweh our God says,</p><p>because he promises/says that he will enable us, his people, to live peacefully,</p><p>if we do not return to doing foolish things.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>He is surely ready to save/rescue those who revere him,</p><p>in order that his glory/splendor will be seen in our land.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    When that happens, he will both faithfully love us and faithfully do for us what he promised to do [PRS];</p><p>and we will act/behave righteously, and he will give us peace,</p><p>which will be like a kiss that he gives us.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Here on earth, we will ◄be loyal to/continually believe in► God,</p><p>and from heaven, God will act justly/fairly toward us.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Yes, Yahweh will do good things for us,</p><p>and there will be great harvests in our land.</p><p>

<p>A prayer written by David</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh, listen [IDM] to what I say and answer me,</p><p>because I am weak and needy.</p><p>

    <sup>6</sup>Lord, listen to my prayer;</p><p>hear me when I cry out to you to help me.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>When I have troubles, I call out to you,</p><p>because you answer me.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Lord, among all the gods whom the heathen nations worship,</p><p>there is no one like you;</p><p>not one of them has done the great things that you have done.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Lord, some day, people from all the nations that you have established will come and bow down in front of you</p><p>and they will praise you [MTY].</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>You are great, and you do wonderful/marvelous things;</p><p>only you are God.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Yahweh, teach me what you want me to do</p><p>in order that I may conduct my life according to what you say, which is true.</p><p>Cause/Teach me to revere you.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Lord, my God, I will thank you with all my inner being,</p><p>and I will praise you forever.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>You faithfully love me very much;</p><p>you have prevented me from dying and going to the place where dead people are.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>But God, proud men are trying to attack me;</p><p>a gang/group of cruel men are wanting to kill me;</p><p>they are men who do not have any ◄respect for/interest in► you.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>But Lord, you always are mercifully and kind;</p><p>you do not become angry quickly,</p><p>you faithfully love us very much</p><p>and always do for us what you have promised to do.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>Look down toward me and be merciful to me;</p><p>cause me to be strong and save/rescue me</p><p>who serves you faithfully like my mother did.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Yahweh, do something to show me that you are being good to me</p><p>in order that those who hate me will see that you have encouraged me and helped me,</p><p>and as a result they will be ashamed.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-87"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-87">87</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by one of the descendants of Korah</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>The city that Yahweh established is on his sacred hill.</p><p>

    <sup>4</sup>
    Some of those who know about God are the people of Egypt and Babylonia,</p><p>and also the people of Philistia and Tyre and Ethiopia;</p><p>
    some day they all will say,</p><p>“Although I was not born in Jerusalem,</p><p>

    <sup>5</sup>And concerning Jerusalem, people will say</p><p>
    “It is as though everyone was born there,</p><p>and Almighty God will cause that city to remain strong/safe/secure.”</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Yahweh will write a list of the names of the people of various groups who belong to him,</p><p>and he will say that he considers them all to be citizens of Jerusalem.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>

<p>A psalm that expresses sadness, written for the choir director by Zerah’s son Heman, one of the descendants of Korah</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh God, you who rescues me, all during each day I call out to you to help me,</p><p>and I cry out to you during each night also.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Listen [IDM] to my prayer [DOU],</p><p>while I cry out to you for help!</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>I have experienced many troubles/difficulties,</p><p>and I am about to die [MTY] and go where dead people are.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Because I have no more strength,</p><p>
    other people also consider that I will soon die.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>I am like a corpse that has been abandoned;</p><p>I am like dead people who lie in their graves,</p><p>people who have been completely forgotten,</p><p>because you do not take care of them any more.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    It is as though you have thrown me into a deep, dark pit,</p><p>into a place where they throw corpses.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    It seems like you are very angry with me,</p><p>and it is as though you have crushed me like ocean waves crash down on people [MET].</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>You have caused my friends to ◄avoid/stay away from► me;</p><p>I have become repulsive to them.</p><p>
    It is as though I am in a prison and cannot escape.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>My eyes cannot see well because I cry very much.</p><p>Yahweh, every day I call out to you to help me;</p><p>I lift up my hands to you while I pray.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>You certainly do not [RHQ] perform miracles for dead people!</p><p>Their spirits do not [RHQ] arise to praise you!</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Corpses in the grave certainly do not tell about your faithfully loving us [RHQ],</p><p>and in the place where people are finally destroyed,</p><p>no one tells about what you faithfully do for us [RHQ].</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>No one in the deep dark pit ever sees the miracles that you perform [RHQ],</p><p>and no one in the place where people have been completely forgotten tells about your being good to us.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>But as for me, Yahweh, I cry out to you to help me;</p><p>each morning I pray to you.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>Yahweh, why do you reject me [RHQ]?</p><p>Why do you turn away from me [RHQ]?</p><p>

    <sup>16</sup>
    I feel that you have crushed me because of your being angry with me;</p><p>the terrible things that you are doing to me are almost destroying me.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    I feel as though they surround me like a flood [SIM];</p><p>they are ◄closing in on/crushing► me from all sides.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>You have caused even my friends and others whom I love to avoid me,</p><p>and it is as though the only friend that I have is darkness.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-89"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-89">89</h3></a>
<p>A song written by Ethan, from the clan of Ezra</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh, I will sing forever about the ways you faithfully love me;</p><p>people not yet born will hear that you faithfully do all that you have promised.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>I will tell people that you will faithfully love us forever,</p><p>and that your being faithful to do what you have promised is as permanent as the sky.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Yahweh said, “I have made an agreement with David, whom I chose to serve me.</p><p>I have made this solemn ◄agreement with/promise to► him:</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>‘I will enable various ones of your descendants to always be kings;</p><p>the line of kings descended from you [MTY] will never end.’”</p><p>(Think about that!) 10</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Yahweh, I desire that all those beings who are in [MTY] heaven will praise you for the wonderful things that you do,</p><p>and that all your holy angels will sing about how you faithfully do what you promise.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>There is no one [RHQ] in heaven who can be compared with you, Yahweh.</p><p>There are no angels [RHQ] in heaven who are equal to you.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>When your holy angels gather together,</p><p>they declare that you must be revered;</p><p>they say that you are more awesome than all the angels that surround your throne!</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>O Yahweh, God Almighty, there is no one [RHQ] who is powerful like you are;</p><p>your faithfully doing all that you promise is like a cloak that [MET] always surrounds you.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>You rule over the powerful seas;</p><p>when their waves rise up, you calm them.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>You are the one who crushed and killed the great sea monster named Rahab.</p><p>You defeated and scattered your enemies with your great power [MTY].</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>The heavens are yours, and the earth is yours;</p><p>and everything on the earth is yours, because you created it all.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>You created everything from the north to the south.</p><p>Tabor Mountain and Hermon Mountain joyfully praise you [MTY].</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>◄You/Your arms► are very powerful;</p><p>◄you/your hands► are extremely strong.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>◄Your rule [MTY] over us is based on/As you rule over us, you are always► treating people fairly and justly,</p><p>and on/are always faithfully loving us and doing what you promised.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>Yahweh, happy are the people who worship you with joyful shouts,</p><p>who live knowing that you are always watching over them.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>Every day, throughout the day, they rejoice in what you [MTY] have done,</p><p>and they praise you for being very good to them.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>You give us your glorious strength;</p><p>because you act in our favor, we defeat [MET] our enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>Yahweh, you gave us the one who protects us [MET];</p><p>you, the holy God whom we Israelis worship, chose a king for us.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Long ago you spoke in a vision to one of your servants/prophets, saying,</p><p>“I have helped a famous soldier;</p><p>I chose him from among all the people to be a king.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>That man is David, the one who will serve me faithfully,</p><p>and I anointed him with sacred olive oil to make him king.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>I [MTY] will always strengthen him;</p><p>with my power [MTY] I will make him strong.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>His enemies will never find ways to defeat him,</p><p>and wicked people will never defeat him.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>I will crush his enemies in front of him</p><p>and get rid of those who hate him.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>I will always be loyal to him and faithfully love him</p><p>and enable him to defeat [MET] his enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>I will cause ◄his kingdom/the area that he rules► to include all the land from the Mediterranean Sea to the Euphrates River.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>He will say to me, ‘You are my Father,</p><p>my God, the one who protects [MET] and saves me.’</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>I will give him the rights/privileges that a man’s firstborn son has [MET];</p><p>he will be the greatest king on the earth.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>I will always be loyal to him,</p><p>and my agreement to bless him will last forever.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>I will establish a line of his descendants that will never end,</p><p>various ones of his descendants will always be kings.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>But, if some of his descendants disobey my laws,</p><p>and do not not behave like my commands say that they should,</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>if they disregard my requirements</p><p>and do not do the right things that I have told them to do,</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>I will punish them severely [MTY]</p><p>and cause them to suffer for doing wrong.</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>But I will not stop faithfully loving David,</p><p>and I will always do what I promised him.</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>I will not break the agreement that I made with him;</p><p>I will not change even one word that I spoke to him.</p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>Once I made a solemn promise to David, and that will never change,</p><p>and because I am God, I will never lie to David.</p><p>
    <sup>36</sup>
    I promised that the line of kings descended from him will go on forever;</p><p>it will last as long as the sun shines.</p><p>
    <sup>37</sup>That line will ◄be as permanent/last as long► as the moon</p><p>that is always watching everything from the sky.</p><p>Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>38</sup>But Yahweh, now you have rejected [DOU] David!</p><p>You are very angry with the king whom you appointed.</p><p>
    <sup>39</sup>
    It seems that you have broken the agreement that you made with your servant, David;</p><p>it seems as though you have signaled that he is no longer the king by  throwing his crown into the dust/dirt.</p><p>
    <sup>40</sup>You have torn down the walls that protect his city,</p><p>and allowed all his forts to become ruins.</p><p>
    <sup>41</sup>All those who pass by plunder/steal his possessions;</p><p>his neighbors ◄laugh at/ridicule► him.</p><p>
    <sup>42</sup>You have enabled his enemies to defeat him;</p><p>you have made them all happy.</p><p>
    <sup>43</sup>You have caused his sword to become useless,</p><p>and you have not helped him in his battles.</p><p>
    <sup>44</sup>You have caused his splendor to end (OR, You have taken away his power</p><p>by knocking his throne to the ground.</p><p>
    <sup>45</sup>You have caused him to look old when he is still young</p><p>and caused him to be very shamed/disgraced.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>46</sup>O Yahweh, how long will this continue?</p><p>Will you hide yourself forever?</p><p>How long will your anger burn like a fire?</p><p>
    <sup>47</sup>Do not forget that life is very short;</p><p>have you created all us people in vain?</p><p>
    <sup>48</sup>No one can [RHQ] keep on living and never die;</p><p>◄No one can [RHQ] avoid going/Everyone will go► to the place of the dead.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>49</sup>Yahweh, you promised long ago</p><p>that you would faithfully love us;</p><p>why are you not doing that?</p><p>You solemnly promised that to David!</p><p>
    <sup>50</sup>Yahweh, do not forget that people insult me!</p><p>◄Heathen people/People who do not know you► curse me!</p><p>
    <sup>51</sup>Yahweh, your enemies insult your chosen king!</p><p>They insult/ridicule him wherever he goes.</p><p>

<p>Book Four</p><p>A prayer by the prophet Moses</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Lord, you have always ◄been like a home for us/protected us► [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Before you created the mountains,</p><p>before you formed the earth and everything that is in it,</p><p>you were eternally God,</p><p>and you will be God forever.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    When people die, you cause their corpses to become soil again;</p><p>you change their corpses to become dirt like the first man was created from.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>When you ◄consider/think about► time,</p><p>1,000 years are as short as [SIM] one day which passes;</p><p>
    you consider that [HYP] they are as short as a few hours in the night.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>You cause people suddenly to die [MET];</p><p>they live only a short time, like a dream lasts only a short time.</p><p>They are like grass/weeds [SIM] that grow up.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>In the morning [DOU] the grass sprouts and grows well,</p><p>but in the evening it dries up and ◄completely withers/dies►.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    Similarly, because of the sins that we have committed, you become angry with us;</p><p>you terrify us and then you destroy us.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    It is as though you place our sins in front of you,</p><p>you spread out even our secret sins where you can see them.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Because you are angry with us, you cause our lives to end;</p><p>the years that we live pass as quickly as a sigh does.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>People live for only 70 years;</p><p>but if they are strong, some of them live for 80 years.</p><p>But even during good years we have much pain and troubles;</p><p>our lives soon end, and we die [EUP].</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>No one [RHQ] has fully experienced the powerful things you can do to them when you are angry with them,</p><p>and people are not afraid that you will greatly punish them because of your being angry with them.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>So teach/help us to realize that we live for only a short time</p><p>in order that we may use our time wisely.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Yahweh, how long will you be angry with us?</p><p>Pity us who serve you.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>Each morning show us that your faithfully loving us is enough for us</p><p>in order that we may shout joyfully and be happy for the rest of our lives.</p><p>

    <sup>6</sup>You will not be afraid of ◄plagues/widespread sicknesses► that demons cause when they attack people at night,</p><p>or of other evil forces that kill people at midday.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Even if 1,000 people fall dead alongside you,</p><p>even if 10,000 people are dying around you,</p><p>you will not be harmed.</p><p>

    Even when righteous people become old, they do many things [IDM] that please God.</p><p>They remain strong and full of energy, like trees that [MET] remain full of sap.</p><p>

    <sup>20</sup>You have nothing to do with wicked judges,</p><p>who establish laws that allow people to do what is not legal.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>They plan to get rid of righteous people,</p><p>and they declare that ◄innocent people/people who have not done what is wrong► must be executed.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>But Yahweh ◄has become like my fortress/protects me► [MET];</p><p>my God is like a huge rock under which I am protected/safe [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>He will punish those wicked leaders in return for the wicked things that they have done,</p><p>and will get rid of them for the sins that they have committed;</p><p>

    <sup>8</sup>He says, “Do not become stubborn [IDM] like your ancestors did at Meribah,</p><p>and like they did at Massah in the desert.</p><p>

    <sup>2</sup>You created/caused light to be like your robe [MET].</p><p>You spread out the sky like a man sets up a tent.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>You made/put your home in heaven, above the rain clouds in the sky, like a man puts the rafters of his house in place [MET].</p><p>You made/caused the clouds to be like chariots to carry you.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>You caused the winds to be like your messengers [MET],</p><p>and flames of fire to be like your servants.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>You placed the world firmly on its foundation</p><p>so that it can never be moved/shaken.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    Later, you covered the earth with a flood, like a blanket,</p><p>with the water that covered the mountains.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    But when you rebuked the water, the oceans receded;</p><p>your voice spoke like thunder,</p><p>and then the waters rushed away.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Mountains rose up from the water,</p><p>and the valleys sank down</p><p>to the levels that you had determined for them.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    Then you set a boundary for the oceans, a boundary that they cannot cross;</p><p>their water will never again cover the whole earth.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>You make/cause springs to pour water into ravines;</p><p>their water flows down between the mountains.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Those streams provide water for all the animals to drink;</p><p>the wild donkeys drink the water and are no longer thirsty.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Birds make their nests alongside the streams,</p><p>and they sing among the branches of the trees.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>From ◄your home in heaven/the sky► you send rain down on the mountains,</p><p>and you fill the earth with many good things that you create.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>You make/cause grass to grow for the cattle to eat,</p><p>and you make/cause plants to grow for people.</p><p>In that way animals and people get their food from what grows in the soil.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>We get grapes to make [MTY] wine to drink and make us cheerful,</p><p>and we get olives to make [MTY] olive oil to put on our skin and cause it to shine,</p><p>and we get grain to make [MTY] bread to give us strength.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>Yahweh, you send plenty of rain to water your trees,</p><p>the cedar trees that you planted in Lebanon.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Birds make their nests in those trees;</p><p>even storks make their nests in pine/fir trees.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>High up in the mountains the wild goats live,</p><p>and hyraxes/badgers live in the crags/crevices in the rocks.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    Yahweh, you made the moon to indicate the times for our festivals,</p><p>and you made the sun that knows when to go down.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>You bring darkness, and it becomes night,</p><p>when all the animals in the forest prowl around, looking for food.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>At night the young lions roar as they seek their prey,</p><p>
    but they depend on you to give them food.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>At dawn, they go back to their dens and lie down.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>And during the daytime, people go to their work;</p><p>they work until it is evening.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>Yahweh, you have made so many different kinds of things!</p><p>You were very wise as you made them all.</p><p>The earth is full of the creatures that you made.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    We see the ocean which is very large [DOU]!</p><p>It is full of many kinds of living creatures,</p><p>big ones and little ones.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>We see the ships which sail along!</p><p>We see the huge sea monster, which you made to ◄splash around/play► in the sea.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>All of those creatures depend on you</p><p>to give them the food that they need.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>When you give them the food that they need,</p><p>they gather it.</p><p>You give them what you have in your hand,</p><p>and they eat it and are satisfied.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>
    But if you refuse to give food to them,</p><p>they become terrified.</p><p>And when you cause them to stop breathing, they die;</p><p>their bodies decay and become soil again.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>When you cause newborn creatures to begin to breathe,</p><p>they start to live;</p><p>you give new life to all the living creatures on the earth.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>I want the glory of Yahweh to last forever.</p><p>I want him to rejoice about all the things that he has created.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>He causes the earth to shake just by looking at it!</p><p>By merely touching the mountains he makes/causes them to pour out fire and smoke!</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>I will sing to Yahweh ◄as long as I live/throughout my entire life►.</p><p>I will praise my God until the day that I die.</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>I want Yahweh to be pleased by all those things that I have thought about him,</p><p>because I rejoice about knowing him.</p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>
    But I desire that sinners will disappear from the earth,</p><p>so that there will be no more wicked people!</p><p>
    But as for me, I will praise Yahweh!</p><p>◄Praise him/Hallelujah►!</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-105"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-105">105</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>Give thanks to Yahweh, and tell others that he is very great!</p><p>Tell everyone in the world what he has done!</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Sing to him; praise him as you sing to him;</p><p>tell others about his wonderful miracles.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Be happy because you know that he [MTY] is holy!</p><p>You people who worship Yahweh, rejoice!</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Ask Yahweh to help you and give you his strength,</p><p>and continue to ask him!</p><p>
    <sup>5-6</sup>You people who are descendants of God’s servant Abraham,</p><p>you descendants of Jacob, the man God chose,</p><p>think about all the wonderful things that he has done:</p><p>He performed miracles, and he punished all our enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>He is Yahweh, our God.</p><p>He rules and judges people throughout the earth.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>He never forgets the agreement that he made;</p><p>he made a promise that will last for 1,000 generations;</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>that is the agreement that he made with Abraham,</p><p>and he repeated that agreement with Isaac.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    Later he confirmed it again to Jacob</p><p>as an agreement for the Israeli people that would last forever.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>What he said was, “I will give you the Canaan region;</p><p>it will belong to you and your descendants forever.”</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    He said that to them when there were only a few of them,</p><p>a tiny group of people who were living in that land like strangers.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>They continued to wander from one place to another,</p><p>from one kingdom to another.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>But he did not allow others to oppress them.</p><p>He warned those kings by saying to them,</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>“Do not do harm the people whom I have chosen!</p><p>Do not harm my prophets!”</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>He sent a famine to Canaan, and as a result all the people had no food to eat.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>So his people went to Egypt, but first he sent someone there.</p><p>He sent Joseph, who had been sold to be a slave.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    Later, while Joseph was in prison in Egypt,</p><p>they put his legs in shackles that bruised his feet,</p><p>and they put an iron collar around his neck.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>There, Yahweh ◄refined Joseph’s character/tested Joseph to see if Joseph would continue to trust him►,</p><p>until what Joseph predicted would happen ◄came true/happened►.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>The king of Egypt summoned him, and he set Joseph free;</p><p>this ruler of many people-groups released Joseph from prison.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    Then he appointed him to take care of everything in the king’s household,</p><p>to take care of everything that the king possessed.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>◄Joseph was permitted/He permitted Joseph► to command the king’s servants</p><p>to do anything that Joseph wanted them to do,</p><p>and even to tell the king’s advisors the things that they should do for the people of Egypt.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>Later, Joseph’s father Jacob arrived in Egypt.</p><p>He lived like a foreigner in the land that belonged to the descendants of Ham.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>And years later Yahweh caused the descendants of Jacob to become very numerous.</p><p>
    As a result, their enemies, the Egyptians, considered that the Israelis were too strong.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    So Yahweh caused the rulers of Egypt to ◄turn against/hate► the Israeli people,</p><p>and they planned ways to get rid of his people.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    But then Yahweh sent his servant Moses</p><p>along with Moses’ older brother Aaron, whom Yahweh had also chosen to be his servant.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>Those two performed amazing miracles among the people of Egypt,</p><p>in that land where the descendants of Ham lived.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>Yahweh sent darkness, so that the people of Egypt could not see anything [DOU],</p><p>but the rulers of Egypt refused [RHQ] to obey when Moses and Aaron commanded them to let the Israeli people leave Egypt.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>Yahweh caused all the water in Egypt to become ◄blood/red like blood►,</p><p>and his doing that caused all the fish to die.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>
    Then he caused the land to become full of frogs;</p><p>the king and his officials even had frogs in their bedrooms.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>
    Then Yahweh commanded that flies come, and swarms of them descended on the people of Egypt,</p><p>and gnats also swarmed across the whole country.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>Instead of sending rain, Yahweh sent terrible hail,</p><p>and lightning flashed throughout the land.</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>The hail ruined their grapevines and fig trees</p><p>and shattered all the other trees.</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>He commanded locusts to come, and swarms of them came;</p><p>
    so many that they could not be counted.</p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>The locusts ate every green plant in the land,</p><p>ruining all the crops.</p><p>
    <sup>36</sup>
    Then Yahweh killed the oldest son in every house of the people of Egypt [DOU].</p><p>
    <sup>37</sup>Then he brought the Israeli people out from Egypt;</p><p>they were carrying loads of jewelry made of silver and gold that the women of Egypt had given to them.</p><p>No one was left behind because of being sick.</p><p>
    <sup>38</sup>
    The people of Egypt were glad when the Israeli people left,</p><p>because they had become very afraid of the Israelis.</p><p>
    <sup>39</sup>
    Then Yahweh spread a cloud to cover the Israelis;</p><p>and at night it became a big fire in the sky to give them light.</p><p>
    <sup>40</sup>
    Later the Israelis asked for meat to eat,</p><p>and Yahweh sent flocks of quail to them,</p><p>and he gave them plenty of manna food from the sky each morning.</p><p>
    <sup>41</sup>
    One day he caused a rock to open up and water poured out for them to drink;</p><p>it was like a river flowing in that desert.</p><p>
    <sup>42</sup>
    He did that because he kept thinking about the sacred promise that he had given to his servant, Abraham.</p><p>
    <sup>43</sup>So his people were joyful as he brought them out from Egypt;</p><p>those people whom he had chosen were shouting joyfully as they went.</p><p>
    <sup>44</sup>He gave to them the land that belonged to the people-groups that lived there in Canaan,</p><p>and the Israelis harvested crops that other people had planted.</p><p>
    <sup>45</sup>
    Yahweh did all these things</p><p>in order that his people would do all the things that he had commanded them to do [DOU].</p><p>Praise Yahweh!</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-106"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-106">106</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>Praise Yahweh!</p><p>Praise Yahweh, because he does good things for us;</p><p>he faithfully loves us forever/continually!</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    Because Yahweh has done many great things,</p><p>no one can [RHQ] tell all the great things that Yahweh has done,</p><p>and no one can praise him enough/sufficiently.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>◄Happy are/He is pleased with► those who act fairly/justly,</p><p>with those who always do what is right.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Yahweh, be kind to me when you help your people;</p><p>help me when you rescue/save them.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Allow me to see it when your people become prosperous again</p><p>and when all the people of your nation, Israel, are happy;</p><p>allow me to be happy with them!</p><p>I want to praise you along with all those others who belong to you.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>We and our ancestors have sinned;</p><p>we have done things that were very wicked [DOU].</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>When our ancestors were in Egypt,</p><p>they did not pay attention to the wonderful things that Yahweh did;</p><p>they forgot about the many times that he showed that he faithfully loved them.</p><p>Instead, when they were at the Red Sea,</p><p>they rebelled against God, who is greater than any other god.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>But he rescued them for the sake of his own reputation</p><p>in order that he could show that he is very powerful.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>He rebuked the Red Sea and it became dry,</p><p>and then while he led our ancestors across it,</p><p>they walked through it as though it were as dry as a desert [SIM].</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>In that way he rescued them from the power [MTY] of their enemies who hated them [DOU].</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    Then their enemies were drowned in the water of the Red Sea;</p><p>not one of them was left.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>When that happened, our ancestors believed that Yahweh had truly done for them what he had promised to do,</p><p>and they sang to praise him.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>But they soon forgot what he had done for them;</p><p>they did things without waiting to find out what Yahweh wanted them to do.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>They intensely wanted food like they formerly ate in Egypt.</p><p>They did evil things to find out if they could do those things without God punishing them.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    So he gave them what they requested,</p><p>but he also caused a terrible disease to afflict them.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    Later when some of the men became jealous of Moses</p><p>and his older brother Aaron, who was dedicated to serve Yahweh by being a priest,</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>the ground opened up and swallowed Dathan</p><p>and also buried Abiram and his family.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>And God sent a fire down from heaven</p><p>which burned up all the wicked people who ◄supported them/agreed with► them.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Then the Israeli leaders made a gold statue at Sinai Mountain</p><p>and worshiped it.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>Instead of worshiping our glorious God,</p><p>they started to worship a statue of a bull that eats grass!</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>They forgot about God, who had rescued them by the great miracles that he performed in Egypt.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>They forgot about the wonderful things that he did for them in Egypt</p><p>and the amazing/awesome things that he did for them at the Red Sea.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>Because of that, God said that he would get rid of the Israelis,</p><p>but Moses, whom God had chosen to serve him, pleaded with God not to get rid of them.</p><p>And as a result God did not destroy them.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    Later, our ancestors ◄refused/were afraid► to enter beautiful Canaan land</p><p>because they did not believe that God would enable them to take the land from the people who were living there, as he had promised.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>They stayed in their tents and grumbled</p><p>and would not pay attention to what Yahweh said that they should do.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>So he solemnly [MTY] told them</p><p>that he would cause them to die there in the desert,</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>and that he would scatter their descendants among the people of other nations/people-groups who did not believe in him,</p><p>and that he would allow them to die in those lands.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>Later the Israeli people started to worship the idol of Baal who they thought lived at Peor Mountain,</p><p>and they ate meat that had been sacrificed to Baal and those other lifeless gods.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>Yahweh became very angry because of what they had done,</p><p>
    so again he sent a terrible disease to attack/strike them.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>But Phinehas stood up and punished/killed the ones who had sinned greatly,</p><p>and as a result the ◄plague/serious disease► ended.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>People have remembered that righteous thing that Phinehas did,</p><p>and in future years people will remember it.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>
    Then at Meribah Springs our ancestors caused Yahweh to become angry,</p><p>and as a result Moses had trouble.</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>They caused Moses to become very angry [IDM],</p><p>and he said things that were foolish.</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>Our ancestors did not destroy the people who did not believe in Yahweh</p><p>like he told them to do.</p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>Instead, they mingled with people from those people-groups,</p><p>and they started to do the evil things that those people did.</p><p>
    <sup>36</sup>Our ancestors worshiped the idols of those people,</p><p>which resulted in their being destroyed/exiled/taken to another country [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>37</sup>
    Some of the Israelis sacrificed their sons and daughters to the demons that those idols represented.</p><p>
    <sup>38</sup>They killed [MTY] their own children, who ◄were innocent/had not done things that were wrong►,</p><p>and offered them as sacrifices to the idols in Canaan.</p><p>
    As a result, Canaan land was polluted by those murders [MTY].</p><p>
    <sup>39</sup>So by their deeds they caused themselves to become unacceptable to God;</p><p>
    because they did not faithfully worship only God,</p><p>
    they became like women who sleep with other men instead of sleeping only with their husbands [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>40</sup>So Yahweh became very angry with his people;</p><p>he was completely disgusted with them.</p><p>
    <sup>41</sup>
    As a result he allowed people-groups who did not believe in him to conquer them,</p><p>so those who hated our ancestors started to rule over them.</p><p>
    <sup>42</sup>Their enemies ◄oppressed them/treated them cruelly►</p><p>and completely controlled them [MET].</p><p>
    <sup>43</sup>Many times Yahweh rescued them,</p><p>but they continued to rebel against him,</p><p>and they were finally destroyed because of the sins that they committed.</p><p>
    <sup>44</sup>However, Yahweh always heard them when they cried out to him;</p><p>he listened to them when they were distressed.</p><p>
    <sup>45</sup>For their sake, he thought about the agreement/promise that he had made to bless them,</p><p>and because he never stopped loving them very much,</p><p>he changed his mind about punishing them more.</p><p>
    <sup>46</sup>He caused all those who had taken the Israelis to Babylonia to ◄feel sorry for/pity► them.</p><p>
    <sup>47</sup>Yahweh our God, rescue/save us</p><p>and bring us back to Israel from among those people-groups</p><p>in order that we may thank you [MTY]</p><p>and joyfully praise you.</p><p>
    <sup>48</sup>Praise Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis worship,</p><p>praise him now and forever!</p><p>And I want everyone to say, “Amen/May it be so!”</p><p>Praise Yahweh!</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-107"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-107">107</h3></a>
<p>Book Five</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Give thanks to Yahweh, because he always does good things for us</p><p>His faithful love for us lasts forever!</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Those whom Yahweh has saved should tell others</p><p>that he has rescued them from their enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>He has gathered those of you who were ◄exiled/taken forcefully► to many lands;</p><p>
    he has gathered you together from the east and the west,</p><p>from the north and from the south.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Some of those who returned from those countries wandered in the desert;</p><p>they were lost and had no homes to live in.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>They were hungry and thirsty,</p><p>and they were very discouraged.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>When they were in trouble, they called out to Yahweh,</p><p>and he rescued them from ◄being distressed/their difficulties►.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>He led them along a straight road where they walked safely</p><p>to cities in Canaan where they could live.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>They should praise/thank Yahweh for loving them faithfully</p><p>and for the wonderful things that he does for people.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>He gives thirsty people plenty of water to drink,</p><p>and he gives hungry people plenty of good things to eat.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Some of them were in very dark [HEN] ◄places in Babylonia/other countries►;</p><p>they were prisoners, suffering because of chains fastened to their hands and feet.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>They were in prison because they had ◄rebelled against/not obeyed► the message of God;</p><p>they were there because they had despised the advice given by God,</p><p>who is greater than all other gods.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    That is why their bodies were worn out from hard labor;</p><p>when they fell down, there was no one who would help them.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>In their troubles, they called out to Yahweh,</p><p>and he rescued them from their being distressed.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>He broke the chains that were on their hands and feet;</p><p>and brought them out of those very dark prisons.</p><p>
    <sup>15-16</sup>He broke down the prison gates that were made of bronze,</p><p>and cut through the prison bars that were made of iron.</p><p>
    So they also should praise/thank Yahweh for faithfully loving them,</p><p>and for all the wonderful things that he does for people.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Some of them foolishly rebelled against God,</p><p>so they suffered for their sins.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>They did not want to eat any food,</p><p>and they almost died.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>In their troubles, they also called out to Yahweh,</p><p>and he rescued them from their being distressed.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>When he commanded that they be healed, they were healed;</p><p>he saved them from dying.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>They also should praise/thank Yahweh for faithfully loving them,</p><p>and for all the wonderful things that he does for people.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>They should give offerings to him to show that they are thankful,</p><p>and they should sing joyfully about the miracles that he has performed.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>Some of them sailed in ships;</p><p>they were selling things in ports throughout the world.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    As they were sailing, they also saw the miracles that Yahweh performed,</p><p>the wonderful things that he did when they were on very deep seas.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>He commanded the winds, and they became strong</p><p>and ◄stirred up high waves/caused waves to rise high►.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>The ships in which they were sailing were tossed high in the air,</p><p>and then they sank into the ◄troughs/low places► between the high waves;</p><p>then the sailors were terrified.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>They stumbled about and staggered like drunken men,</p><p>and they did not know what to do.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>In their troubles, they also called out to Yahweh,</p><p>and he rescued them from their distresses.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>He ◄calmed the storm/caused the wind to stop blowing►,</p><p>and he caused the waves to completely subside.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>They were very glad when it became calm;</p><p>and Yahweh brought them safely into a harbor.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>They also should praise/thank Yahweh for faithfully loving them,</p><p>and for all the wonderful things that he does for people.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>They should praise him among the Israeli people when they have gathered together,</p><p>and they should praise him in front of the leaders of the country.</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>
    Sometimes Yahweh causes rivers to become dry,</p><p>
    with the result that the land becomes a desert,</p><p>and springs of water become dry land.</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>
    Sometimes he causes land that has produced lots of crops to become salty wastelands,</p><p>
    with the result that they do not produce crops.</p><p>He does that because the people who live there are very wicked.</p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>
    But sometimes he causes pools of water to appear in deserts,</p><p>and he causes springs to flow in very dry ground.</p><p>
    <sup>36</sup>He brings hungry people into that land, to live there and build cities there.</p><p>
    <sup>37</sup>They plant seeds in their fields,</p><p>and they plant grapevines that produce big crops of grapes.</p><p>
    <sup>38</sup>He blesses the people, and the women give birth to many children,</p><p>and they have large herds of cattle.</p><p>
    <sup>39</sup>When the number of people becomes smaller and they have been humiliated by their enemies</p><p>by being oppressed and caused to suffer [DOU],</p><p>
    <sup>40</sup>Yahweh shows contempt for the leaders who oppress them,</p><p>and causes them to wander in deserts where there are no roads.</p><p>
    <sup>41</sup>But he rescues poor people from ◄being in misery/suffering►,</p><p>and causes their families to increase in number  like flocks of sheep.</p><p>
    <sup>42</sup>Godly/Righteous people will ◄see/hear about► these things, and they will rejoice,</p><p>and wicked people will hear about these things, too,</p><p>
    but they will have nothing to say in reply.</p><p>
    <sup>43</sup>Those who are wise should think carefully about those things;</p><p>they should consider all the things that Yahweh has done to show that he faithfully loves them.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-108"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-108">108</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>God, I am ◄very confident/trusting completely► [IDM] in you.</p><p>I will sing to praise you.</p><p>with all my inner being.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>I will arise before the sun rises,</p><p>and I will praise you while I play my big harp and my ◄lyre/small harp►.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    I prayed, “Yahweh, I will thank you among all the people-groups;</p><p>I will sing to praise you among the nations,</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>because your faithful love for us reaches up to the heavens,</p><p>and your faithfully doing what you promise is as great as the distance up to the clouds.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Yahweh, show in the heavens that you are very great!</p><p>And show your glory to people all over the earth!</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Answer our prayers and by your power help us [MTY] to defeat our enemies</p><p>in order that we, the people whom you love, may be saved/rescued.”</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>And Yahweh answered our prayers and spoke from his temple, saying, “Because I have conquered your enemies, I will joyfully divideeverything in Shechem city</p><p>and I will distribute among my people the valuable things in Succoth Valley.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>The Gilead region is mine;</p><p>the people of the tribe of Manasseh are mine;</p><p>
    the tribe of Ephraim is like my war helmet,</p><p>and the tribe of Judah is like the ◄scepter/stick that I hold which shows that I am the ruler► [MET];</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>the Moab region is like my washbasin [MET];</p><p>I throw my sandal in the Edom area to show that it belongs to me;</p><p>I shout triumphantly because I have defeated the people of the Philistia area.”</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    Because we want to attack the people of Edom,</p><p>◄who will lead my army triumphantly to their capital city that has strong walls around it?/I want someone to lead my army triumphantly to their capital city that has strong walls around it.► [RHQ]</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>God, we hope that [RHQ] you have not abandoned us,</p><p>and that you will go with us when our army marches out to fight our enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    We need you to help us when we fight against our enemies,</p><p>because the help that humans can give us is worthless.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    But with you helping us, we shall win;</p><p>you will enable us to defeat our enemies.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-109"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-109">109</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David for the choir director</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>God, you are the one whom I praise,</p><p>
    So please answer my prayer,</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>because wicked people slander me</p><p>and tell [MTY] lies about me.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>They are constantly saying that they hate me,</p><p>and they say evil things about me for no reason.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>I show them that I want to be their friends</p><p>and I pray for them,</p><p>but instead of being kind to me, they say that I have done evil things.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>In return for my doing good things for them and loving them,</p><p>they do evil things to me and hate me.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>They said, “Appoint a wicked judge who will judge him,</p><p>and bring in one of his enemies who will stand up and accuse him.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>And cause that when the trial ends,</p><p>
    the judge will declare that he is guilty,</p><p>and that even his prayer will be considered to be a sin.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    Then, cause that he will soon die</p><p>and that someone else will have his job/work (OR, possessions).</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Cause that his children will not have a father any more</p><p>and that his wife will become a widow.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Cause that his children will be forced to leave the ruined homes that they have been living in</p><p>and wander around begging for food.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Cause that all the people to whom he owed money will seize all his property;</p><p>Cause that strangers will take away everything that he worked to acquire.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Cause that while he is still living no one will be kind to him,</p><p>and after he dies, cause that no one will pity his children.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Cause that all his descendants will die</p><p>and that his grandchildren will not remember who he [MTY] was.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>Yahweh, remember and do not forgive his ancestors for the evil things that they did,</p><p>and do not even forgive the sins that his mother committed;</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>think about his sins continually,</p><p>and cause that his name will be completely forgotten.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>He never was kind to anyone;</p><p>he ◄persecuted/cause problems for► poor and needy people</p><p>and even killed helpless people.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>He liked to curse people.</p><p>
    So cause those terrible things that he requested to happen to others to happen to him!</p><p>He did not want to bless others,</p><p>
    so cause that no one will bless him!</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>He cursed other people as often/easily as he put on his clothes [SIM];</p><p>cause that the terrible things that he wanted to happen to others will happen to him and enter his body like water that he drinks [SIM],</p><p>like olive oil soaks into a person’s bones when it is rubbed on his skin [SIM].</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Cause that those terrible things will cling to him like his clothes</p><p>and be around him like the belt that he wears every day.”</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>Yahweh, I want you to punish all my enemies that way,</p><p>those who say evil things about me.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>But Yahweh, my God, do good things for me</p><p>in order that I may honor you;</p><p>rescue me from my enemies</p><p>because your faithfully loving me is good.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    I ask you to do this because I am poor and needy</p><p>and my inner being is ◄full of pain/very troubled/discouraged►.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    I think that my time to remain alive is short,</p><p>like an evening shadow that will soon disappear [SIM].</p><p>I will be blown away like a locust/grasshopper is blown by the wind.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>My knees are weak because I have ◄fasted/abstained from eating food► very often,</p><p>and my body has become very thin.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>The people who accuse me make fun of me;</p><p>when they see me, they insult me by shaking their heads at me as though I were an evil man.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>Yahweh, my God, help me!</p><p>Because you faithfully love me, rescue me!</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>
    When you save me,</p><p>cause my enemies to know that you are the one who has done it!</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>They may curse me, but I ask that you bless me.</p><p>Cause those who ◄persecute/cause problems for► me to be defeated and as a result to be disgraced/ashamed,</p><p>and cause me to be glad/happy!</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>Cause those who accuse me to be completely disgraced;</p><p>cause other people to see that they are disgraced, as easily as they see the clothes that they wear [SIM]!</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>But I will thank Yahweh very greatly;</p><p>I will praise him when I am among the crowd of people who are worshiping him.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>
    I will do that because he defends [MTY] needy people like me,</p><p>and saves us from those who have decided/declared that we must be executed.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-110"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-110">110</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh said to my lord the king,</p><p>“Sit here, close to me, in the place of highest honor [MTY]</p><p>until I completely defeat your enemies [MET]</p><p>
    and make them like a stool for your feet!”</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Yahweh also said to him, “I will extend your power as king</p><p>from Jerusalem to other lands;</p><p>you will rule over all your enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>On the day that you lead your armies into battle,</p><p>many of your people will volunteer to join your army.</p><p>Like the dew refreshes the earth early in the morning,</p><p>young men will encourage you by coming to help you.”</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Yahweh has made a solemn promise,</p><p>and he will never change his mind;</p><p>he has said to the king, “You will be a priest forever</p><p>
    serving Yahweh  like Melchizedek did.”</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Yahweh stands in the place of highest honor at your right side;</p><p>when he becomes angry, he will defeat many kings.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>He will judge and punish the people of many nations;</p><p>he will fill the land with their corpses.</p><p>He will crush the heads of other kings all over the earth.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>But my lord the king will drink from streams near the road;</p><p>he will be refreshed after defeating his enemies.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-111"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-111">111</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>Praise Yahweh!</p><p>I will thank Yahweh with my entire inner being,</p><p>every time I am with a large group of godly/righteous people.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>The things that Yahweh has done are wonderful!</p><p>All those who are delighted/pleased with those things</p><p>desire to ◄study/think about► them.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    Because of everything that he does,</p><p>people greatly honor him and respect him because he is a great king;</p><p>the righteous/just things that he does will endure forever.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>He has appointed/established festivals in which we remember the wonderful things that he has done;</p><p>Yahweh always is kind and merciful.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>He provides food for those who revere him;</p><p>he never forgets the agreement that he made with our ancestors.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>By enabling his people to capture the lands that belonged to other people-groups,</p><p>he has shown to us, his people, that he is very powerful.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>He [MTY] faithfully does what he has promised and always does what is just/fair,</p><p>and we can depend on him to help us when he commands us to do things.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>What he commands must be obeyed forever;</p><p>and he acted in a true and righteous manner when he gave us those commands.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>He rescued us, his people, from being slaves in Egypt,</p><p>and he made an agreement with us that will last forever.</p><p>He [MTY] is holy and awesome!</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Revering Yahweh is the way to become wise.</p><p>All those who obey his commands will know what is good for them to decide to do.</p><p>We should praise him forever!</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-112"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-112">112</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>Praise Yahweh!</p><p>◄Happy are/He is pleased with► those who revere him,</p><p>those who happily obey his commands.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Their children will prosper in their land;</p><p>and their descendants will be blessed by God.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Their families [MTY] will be very wealthy [DOU],</p><p>and the results of  their righteous deeds will endure forever.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Godly/Righteous people are like lights [SIM] that shine in the darkness</p><p>on those who are kind, merciful and righteous.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Things will go well for those who generously lend money to others</p><p>and who conduct their businesses honestly.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Righteous people will not be overwhelmed/worried/distressed because of their troubles,</p><p>and they will never be forgotten by other people.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>They are not afraid of receiving bad news;</p><p>they confidently/completely trust in Yahweh.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>They are confident and not afraid,</p><p>because they know that they will see God defeat their enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>They give things generously to poor/needy people;</p><p>
    the results of their kind deeds will endure forever,</p><p>and they will be exalted and honored.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Wicked people see those things and are angry;</p><p>they gnash their teeth angrily,</p><p>but they will disappear and die.</p><p>The wicked things that they want to do will never happen.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-113"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-113">113</h3></a>

    <sup>1</sup>Praise Yahweh!</p><p>You people who serve Yahweh, praise him!</p><p>Praise ◄him/his name►!</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Yahweh should be praised now and forever!</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>People who live in the east and people who live in the west,</p><p>everyone, should praise Yahweh [MTY]!</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Yahweh rules [MTY] over all the nations,</p><p>and high in the heavens he shows that his glory is very great.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>There is no one [RHQ] who is like Yahweh, our God,</p><p>who lives/sits/rules in the highest heaven,</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>and looks far down through the heavens and sees the people on the earth.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    Sometimes he lifts poor people up so that they no longer sit in the dirt;</p><p>he helps needy people so that they no longer sit on heaps of ashes</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>and causes them to be honored by sitting next to princes,</p><p>the sons of the kings who rule their people.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>He also enables women who have no children to have a family;</p><p>he causes them to be happy mothers.</p><p>Praise Yahweh!</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-114"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-114">114</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>When the Israeli people left Egypt,</p><p>when they who were descendants of Jacob left people who spoke a foreign/different language,</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    the land of Judah became the place where people worshiped God;</p><p>and Israel became the land (OR, the Israeli people became the people) that he ruled over.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    When they came to the Red  Sea,</p><p>
    it was as though the water saw them and ran away!</p><p>When they came to the Jordan River,</p><p>that water in the river stopped flowing so that the Israelis could cross it.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    When they came to Sinai Mountain and there was a big earthquake,</p><p>
    it was as though the mountains skipped/jumped like goats do</p><p>and the hills jumped around like lambs do.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    If someone asks, “What happened at the Red Sea that caused the water to run away?</p><p>What happened that caused the water in the Jordan River to stop flowing?</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>What happened that caused the mountains to skip like goats</p><p>and caused the hills to jump around like lambs?”</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    I would reply that it was the presence of the Lord that caused those things to happen!</p><p>
    Everyone/Everything on the earth should tremble in the presence of God, whom ◄Jacob worshiped/the Israeli people worship►!</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>He is the one who caused pools of water for the Israeli people to drink to flow from a rock;</p><p>he caused a spring to flow from a solid rock cliff!</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-115"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-115">115</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh, people should praise only you [MTY];</p><p>they must praise you, not us,</p><p>because you faithfully love us and always do what you have promised to do.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>It is not right that [RHQ] other people-groups should say about us,</p><p>“They claim that their God is very powerful,</p><p>but if that is true, why does he not help them?”</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Our God is in heaven,</p><p>and he does whatever he wants to!</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    But their idols are only statues made of silver and gold,</p><p>things that humans have made.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Their idols have mouths, but they cannot say anything;</p><p>they have eyes, but they cannot see anything.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>They have ears, but they cannot hear anything;</p><p>they have noses, but they cannot smell anything.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>They have hands, but they cannot feel anything;</p><p>they have feet, but they cannot walk,</p><p>and they have throats but cannot even make any sounds!</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>The people who make those idols are as powerless as those idols,</p><p>and those who trust in those idols can accomplish nothing, just like their idols!</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>You, my fellow Israeli people, trust in Yahweh!</p><p>He is the one who helps you and protects you like [MET] a shield.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>You priests [MTY], trust in Yahweh!</p><p>He is the one who helps you and protects you like [MET] a shield.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    All you who revere Yahweh, trust in him!</p><p>He is the one who helps you and protects you like [MET] a shield.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Yahweh has not forgotten us;</p><p>he will bless us Israeli people [MTY]!</p><p>He will bless the priests,</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>and he will bless all those who revere him;</p><p>he will bless important people and people who are considered to be unimportant, everyone!</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>I desire that Yahweh will give many children</p><p>to you my fellow-Israeli people, and to your descendants.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>I desire that Yahweh, the one who made heaven and the earth, will bless all of you!</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>The highest heavens belong to Yahweh,</p><p>but he gave everything that is on the earth to us people.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Dead people are not able to praise Yahweh;</p><p>when they descend into the place where dead people are,</p><p>they are unable to speak and cannot praise him.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>But we who are alive will thank/praise him,</p><p>now and forever.</p><p>Praise Yahweh!</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-116"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-116">116</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>I love Yahweh,</p><p>because he hears me when I cry for him to help me.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>He listens to me,</p><p>so I will call out to him all during my life.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Everything around me [MET] caused me to think that I would die;</p><p>I was very afraid that I would die and go to the place where dead people are.</p><p>I was very distressed/worried and afraid.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    But then I called out to Yahweh, saying,</p><p>“Yahweh, I plead with you to save/rescue me!”</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Yahweh is kind and does what is right;</p><p>he is our God, and he acts mercifully to us.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>He protects those who ◄are helpless/cannot defend themselves►;</p><p>and when I thought that I would die, he saved me.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>I must encourage/tell myself to ◄have inner peace/not worry any more►,</p><p>because Yahweh has done very good things for me.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Yahweh has saved me [SYN] from dying,</p><p>and has kept/protected me from troubles that would cause me to cry.</p><p>He has kept/protected me from stumbling.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    So here on the earth, where people are still alive,</p><p>I live knowing that Yahweh is directing me.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>I continued to believe/trust in Yahweh,</p><p>even when I said, “I am greatly afflicted/troubled.”</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    Even when I was distressed/worried and said, “I cannot trust anyone,”</p><p>
    I continued to trust in Yahweh.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>So now I will tell you [RHQ] what I will offer to Yahweh,</p><p>because of all the good things that he has done for me.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>I will offer to him a cup of wine</p><p>to thank him for saving/rescuing me.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>When I am together with many [HYP] people who belong to Yahweh,</p><p>I will give to him the offerings that I solemnly promised to give to him.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>Yahweh is very grieved/sad when one of his people dies.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>I am one of those who serve Yahweh;</p><p>I serve him like my mother did.</p><p>He has freed/saved me from dying (OR, from being fastened by chains).</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    So I will offer to him a sacrifice to thank him,</p><p>and I will pray to him.</p><p>
    <sup>18-19</sup>When I am together with many of [HYP] the people who belong to Yahweh,</p><p>
    in the courtyard outside his temple in Jerusalem,</p><p>I will give to him the offerings that I solemnly promised to give to him.</p><p>Praise Yahweh!</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-117"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-117">117</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>You people of all nations, praise Yahweh!</p><p>All you people-groups, extol/praise him,</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>because he faithfully loves us very much.</p><p>and he will forever faithfully do for us what he promised that he would do.</p><p>Praise Yahweh!</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-118"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-118">118</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>Tell Yahweh that you thank him very much for the good things that he has done for you</p><p>He faithfully loves us, his people, forever.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>You Israeli people should repeatedly shout,</p><p>“He faithfully loves us, his people, forever!”</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>You priests who are descendants of Aaron should repeatedly shout,</p><p>“He faithfully loves us, his people, forever!”</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>All you who revere him should repeatedly shout,</p><p>“He faithfully loves us, his people, forever!”</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>When I was distressed, I called out to Yahweh,</p><p>and he answered me and set me free from my worries/troubles.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Yahweh is ◄on my side/helping me►,</p><p>so I will not be afraid of anything.</p><p>No one [RHQ] can do anything that will prevent God from blessing me forever.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    Yes, Yahweh is ◄on my side/helping me►,</p><p>
    so I will look triumphantly at my enemies while he defeats them.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>It is better to trust in Yahweh</p><p>than to ◄depend on/trust in► people.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>It is better to trust Yahweh to protect us</p><p>than to trust that influential/important people will protect us.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Armies of [MTY] many nations surrounded me,</p><p>
    but Yahweh enabled me to defeat them by his power [MTY].</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>They completely surrounded me,</p><p>
    but I defeated them all by the power of Yahweh.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>They swarmed around me like angry bees;</p><p>they were like a fire that blazes strongly, but only briefly, in a thornbush,</p><p>
    but I defeated them by the power [MTY] that Yahweh gave me.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    My enemies attacked me fiercely and almost defeated me,</p><p>but Yahweh helped me.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>Yahweh is the one who makes me strong,</p><p>and he is the one about whom I always sing;</p><p>he has saved me from my enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>Listen to the joyful songs of victory being sung in the tents of godly/righteous people!</p><p>They sing, “Yahweh has defeated our enemies by his mighty power [MTY];</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>he has raised his strong right arm to show he has defeated his enemies.</p><p>Yahweh has completely defeated them!”</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>I will not be killed in battle;</p><p>I will live to proclaim the great things that Yahweh has done.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>Yahweh has punished me severely,</p><p>but he has not allowed ◄me to die/my enemies to kill me►.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    You gatekeepers, open for me the gates of the temple</p><p>in order that I may enter and thank Yahweh.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>Those are the gates through which we enter the temple to worship Yahweh;</p><p>godly/righteous people enter those gates.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    Yahweh, I thank you that you answered my prayer,</p><p>and you saved me from my enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    Yahweh’s promised/chosen king is like [MET] the stone which the builders rejected</p><p>
    when they were building a house,</p><p>
    but that stone became the ◄cornerstone/most important stone in the building►.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>◄This was done by Yahweh/Yahweh has done this►,</p><p>and it is a wonderful thing for us to see.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>This is the day in which we remember that Yahweh acted powerfully to defeat our enemies;</p><p>we will rejoice and be glad/happy today.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>Yahweh, we plead with you to keep rescuing us from our enemies.</p><p>Yahweh, please help us ◄accomplish/do well► what we want to do.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>Yahweh, bless the one who will come with your authority [MTY].</p><p>And from the temple we ◄bless/ask Yahweh to bless► all of you.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>Yahweh is God,</p><p>and he has caused his light to shine on us.</p><p>Come, carrying palm branches, and join the people who are starting the festival as they go to the altar.</p><p>

    <sup>81</sup>I am very tired/exhausted while I wait for you to save me from my enemies;</p><p>
    but I confidently expect that you will tell me what you will do.</p><p>
    <sup>82</sup>My eyes are tired from waiting a long time for you to do what you promised/said that you would do,</p><p>and I ask, “When will you help/encourage me?”</p><p>
    <sup>83</sup>I have become as useless as [MET] a wineskin that is shriveled from hanging a long time in the smoke inside a house,</p><p>but I have not forgotten ◄your statutes/what you have decreed that we should do►.</p><p>

    but people are ◄persecuting/causing trouble for► me by telling lies about me, so please help me!</p><p>
    <sup>87</sup>Those people have almost killed me,</p><p>but I have not stopped obeying ◄your principles of behavior/what you have declared that we should do►.</p><p>
    <sup>88</sup>Because you faithfully love me, allow me to continue to live</p><p>in order that I may continue to obey ◄your rules/what you have instructed us to do►.</p><p>
    <sup>89</sup>Yahweh, your words will last forever;</p><p>they will last as long as heaven lasts.</p><p>
    <sup>90</sup>You will faithfully continue doing ◄for people who are not yet born/in every generation► what you have ◄promised/said that you would do►;</p><p>you have put the earth in its place, and it remains firmly there.</p><p>
    <sup>91</sup>To this day, all things on the earth remain because you decided that they should remain;</p><p>everything on the earth serves you.</p><p>
    <sup>92</sup>If I had not been delighted in obeying your laws,</p><p>I would have died because of what I was suffering.</p><p>
    <sup>93</sup>I will never forget ◄your principles of behavior/what you have declared that we should do►,</p><p>because as a result of my obeying them you have enabled me to continue to live.</p><p>
    <sup>94</sup>I belong to you; save/rescue me from my enemies,</p><p>because I have tried to obey ◄your principles of behavior/what you have declared that we should do►.</p><p>
    <sup>95</sup>Wicked men are waiting to kill me,</p><p>but I will think about what you have instructed us to do.</p><p>
    <sup>96</sup>I have learned that there is a limit/end for everything,</p><p>but what you command ◄has no limits/never ends►.</p><p>
    <sup>97</sup>I love your laws very much.</p><p>I ◄meditate on/think about► them all during the day.</p><p>
    <sup>98</sup>Because I know ◄your commands/what you have commanded►,</p><p>and because I think about them all the time,</p><p>I have become wiser than my enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>99</sup>I understand more than my teachers do,</p><p>because I ◄meditate on/think about► ◄your requirements/what you have instructed us to do►.</p><p>
    <sup>100</sup>I understand more than many old people do,</p><p>because I obey ◄your principles of behavior/what you have declared that we should do►.</p><p>
    <sup>101</sup>I have avoided all evil behavior</p><p>in order that I may obey ◄your words/what you have told us to do►.</p><p>
    <sup>102</sup>I have not ◄turned away from/quit► obeying ◄your regulations/the rules that you have given to us►,</p><p>because you have taught me while I have studied them.</p><p>
    <sup>103</sup>
    When I read your words,</p><p>they are like [MET] sweet things that I taste/eat,</p><p>
    yes, they are even sweeter than honey.</p><p>
    <sup>104</sup>Because I have learned ◄your principles of behavior/what you have declared that we should do►,</p><p>I am able to understand many things;</p><p>therefore, I hate all evil things that some people do.</p><p>
    <sup>105</sup>Your words are like [MET] a lamp to guide me;</p><p>they are like a light [MET] to show me the path that I should walk on.</p><p>

    <sup>107</sup>Yahweh, I am suffering very much;</p><p>cause me to be strong/healthy again, as you have promised to do.</p><p>
    <sup>108</sup>Yahweh, when I thank you while I pray, it is like [MET] a sacrifice to you;</p><p>
    please accept it,</p><p>and teach me your ◄regulations/rules that you have given to us►.</p><p>
    <sup>109</sup>
    My enemies are often trying to kill me [IDM],</p><p>but I do not forget your laws.</p><p>
    <sup>110</sup>Wicked people have tried to seize me like a hunter tries to catch an animal with a trap [MET],</p><p>but I have not disobeyed ◄your principles of behavior/what you declared that we should do►.</p><p>
    <sup>111</sup>◄Your requirements/What you have instructed us to do► are my possession forever;</p><p>because of them [PRS], I am joyful.</p><p>
    <sup>112</sup>I ◄have decided/am determined► [IDM] to obey ◄your statutes/what you have decreed that we should do► until the day that I die [MTY].</p><p>
    <sup>113</sup>I hate people who are only partly committed to you,</p><p>but I love your laws.</p><p>
    <sup>114</sup>You are like a place where I can hide from my enemies,</p><p>and you are like a shield [MET] behind which I am protected from them,</p><p>and I trust in your promises.</p><p>
    <sup>115</sup>You evil people, stay away from me</p><p>in order than I may obey ◄my God’s commands/what my God has commanded►!</p><p>

    <sup>117</sup>Hold me up, in order that I will be safe</p><p>and always ◄pay attention to/heed► ◄your statutes/what you have decreed that we should do►.</p><p>
    <sup>118</sup>You reject all those who disobey ◄your statutes/what you have decreed that we should do►;</p><p>but what they deceitfully plan to do will be ◄useless/in vain►.</p><p>
    <sup>119</sup>You get rid of all the wicked people on the earth like [SIM] people throw away trash;</p><p>therefore I love what you have instructed us to do.</p><p>
    <sup>120</sup>I [SYN] tremble because I am afraid of you;</p><p>I am afraid because you punish those who do not obey ◄your regulations/the rules that you have given to us►.</p><p>
    <sup>121</sup>
    But I have done what is right and fair/just;</p><p>
    so do not allow people to oppress/mistreat me.</p><p>
    <sup>122</sup>Promise me that you will do good things for me</p><p>and do not allow proud people to oppress me.</p><p>

    <sup>125</sup>I am one who serves you;</p><p>enable me to understand what you want me to know</p><p>in order that I will know ◄your requirements/what you have instructed us to do►.</p><p>
    <sup>126</sup>Yahweh, now is the time for you to punish people</p><p>because they have disobeyed your laws.</p><p>
    <sup>127</sup>Truly, I love ◄your commands/what you have commanded► more than I love gold;</p><p>I love them more than I love very pure gold.</p><p>
    <sup>128</sup>So I conduct my life by ◄your principles of behavior/what you have declared that we should do►,</p><p>and I hate all the evil things that some people do.</p><p>
    <sup>129</sup>◄Your requirements are/All the things that you have instructed us to do are► wonderful,</p><p>so I obey them with all my inner being.</p><p>
    <sup>130</sup>When someone explains ◄your words/what you have said►,</p><p>
    it is as though they are lighting a light;</p><p>what they say causes even people who have not learned your laws to be wise.</p><p>
    <sup>131</sup>I eagerly desire to know ◄your commands/what you have commanded►,</p><p>like [SIM] a dog that pants with its mouth open wanting to be fed.</p><p>
    <sup>132</sup>Listen to me and act kindly to me,</p><p>like you do to all those who love you [MTY].</p><p>

    <sup>135</sup>Be kind to me</p><p>and teach me ◄your statutes/what you have decreed that we should do►.</p><p>
    <sup>136</sup>I cry very much</p><p>because many people do not obey your laws.</p><p>
    <sup>137</sup>Yahweh, you are righteous</p><p>and ◄your regulations/the rules that you have given to us► are just/fair.</p><p>
    <sup>138</sup>◄Your requirements/All the things that you have instructed us to do► are true</p><p>and are all very right and fair.</p><p>
    <sup>139</sup>I am ◄furious/very angry►</p><p>because my enemies disregard ◄your words/what you have told us to do►.</p><p>
    <sup>140</sup>◄Your promises are/All the things that you have said that you will do are► dependable</p><p>and I love them.</p><p>
    <sup>141</sup>I am not important and people despise me,</p><p>but I do not forget ◄your principles of behavior/what you have declared that we should do►.</p><p>
    <sup>142</sup>You are righteous and you will be righteous forever,</p><p>and your laws will never be changed.</p><p>
    <sup>143</sup>I constantly have troubles/difficulties and I am worried,</p><p>but ◄your commands cause/what you have commanded causes► me to be happy.</p><p>
    <sup>144</sup>◄Your requirements are/All the things that you have instructed us to do are► always fair;</p><p>help me to understand them in order that I may continue to live.</p><p>
    <sup>145</sup>Yahweh, with all my inner being I call out to you;</p><p>answer me and I will obey ◄your statutes/what you have decreed that we should do►.</p><p>
    <sup>146</sup>I call out to you;</p><p>save/rescue me in order that I can continue to obey all ◄your requirements/the things that you have instructed us to do►.</p><p>
    <sup>147</sup>
    Each morning I arise before dawn and call to you to help me;</p><p>I confidently expect you to do what you have ◄promised/said that you will do►.</p><p>
    <sup>148</sup>All during the night I am awake,</p><p>and I ◄meditate on/think about► what you have ◄promised/said that you would do►.</p><p>
    <sup>149</sup>Yahweh, because you faithfully love me,</p><p>listen to me while I pray,</p><p>and keep me safe because of my obeying ◄your regulations/what you have told us to do►.</p><p>
    <sup>150</sup>Those evil people who oppress/persecute me are coming closer to me;</p><p>they do not pay any attention to your laws.</p><p>
    <sup>151</sup>But Yahweh, you are near to me,</p><p>and I know that ◄your commands/what you command► will never be changed.</p><p>
    <sup>152</sup>Long ago I found out about ◄your requirements/all the things that you have instructed us to do►,</p><p>and I know that you intended them to last forever.</p><p>
    <sup>153</sup>Look at me and see that I am suffering very much, and heal me,</p><p>because I do not forget your laws.</p><p>
    <sup>154</sup>Defend me when others accuse me, and rescue me from them;</p><p>allow me to continue to live, as you promised/said that you would.</p><p>
    <sup>155</sup>Wicked people do not obey ◄your statutes/what you have decreed that we should do►,</p><p>so you will certainly not save them.</p><p>
    <sup>156</sup>Yahweh, you are very merciful;</p><p>allow me to continue to live because of my obeying ◄your regulations/the rules that you have given to us►.</p><p>
    <sup>157</sup>Many people are my enemies and many people ◄cause me to suffer/persecute me►,</p><p>but I ◄do not turn aside from/have not stopped obeying► [LIT] ◄your requirements/what you have instructed us to do►.</p><p>
    <sup>158</sup>When I look at those who are not faithful to you, I am disgusted</p><p>because they do not obey ◄your requirements/what you have instructed us to do►.</p><p>

    When we travel toward Jerusalem,</p><p>I look up toward the hills and I ask myself, “Who will help me?”</p><p>

    <sup>4</sup>The one who protects us Israeli people</p><p>never gets sleepy, nor does he sleep [LIT].</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Yahweh watches over us;</p><p>he is like the shade [MET] that protects us from the sun.</p><p>

    <sup>4</sup>We people of the tribes of Israel who belong to Yahweh can now go up there</p><p>as Yahweh commanded that we should do,</p><p>and we can thank him.</p><p>

    <sup>1</sup>You Israeli people, answer this question:</p><p>What would have happened to us if Yahweh had not been ◄helping/fighting for► us?</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>When our enemies attacked us,</p><p>if Yahweh had not been fighting for us,</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>we would have all been killed [IDM]</p><p>because they were very angry with us!</p><p>

    They would have been like [MET] a flood that swept/carried us away;</p><p>

    But praise Yahweh,</p><p>because he has not allowed our enemies to destroy us</p><p>
    like wild animals [MET] tear apart the creatures that they capture.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>We have escaped from our enemies like a bird escapes from the trap that hunters have set;</p><p>
    it is as though the trap that our enemies set for us was broken</p><p>and we have escaped from it!</p><p>

    <sup>2</sup>Like the hills that surround Jerusalem protect the city,</p><p>Yahweh protects us, his people,</p><p>and he will protect us forever.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Wicked people [MTY] should not be allowed to rule over the land where righteous people live.</p><p>If they did that, those righteous people might ◄be encouraged to imitate them and► do things that are wrong.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Yahweh, do good things to those who do good things to others</p><p>and to those who sincerely obey your commands [IDM].</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>But when you punish the wicked people who are not Israelis,</p><p>also punish those Israelis who turn away from walking on the good roads [MET] that you have shown them!</p><p>I wish that things will go well for people in Israel!</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-126"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-126">126</h3></a>

    <sup>1</sup>When Yahweh brought us Israeli people back to Jerusalem (OR, enabled us Israelis to prosper again),</p><p>
    it was wonderful;</p><p>it seemed as though [SIM] we were dreaming.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>We were extremely happy,</p><p>and we [SYN] continued shouting joyfully.</p><p>Then the other people-groups said about us,</p><p>“Yahweh has done great things for them!”</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    And we say, “Yes, Yahweh truly has done great things for us,</p><p>and we are very happy.”</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Yahweh, when it rains, water flows in the streams again after they were dry [SIM].</p><p>Similarly, enable our nation to become great again like it was before.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>We cried when we planted seeds because it was hard work preparing the soil that had not been plowed for many years;</p><p>
    now we want to shout joyfully because we are gathering a big harvest.</p><p>

<p>A psalm written by Solomon for people going up to the temple to worship</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>If people are building a house without knowing whether it is Yahweh’s will to build it,</p><p>they are building it in vain.</p><p>
    Similarly, if Yahweh does not protect a city,</p><p>it is useless for guards/sentries to stay awake to tell people if their enemies come to attack it.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>It is also useless to arise very early and go to sleep late at night</p><p>in order that you can work hard all day to earn money to buy food,</p><p>because Yahweh gives food to those whom he loves.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Children are a gift that comes to parents from Yahweh;</p><p>they are a reward/blessing from him.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>If a man has sons while he is still young,</p><p>
    when they grow up, they will be able to help him defend his family</p><p>like [SIM] a soldier can defend himself if he has a bow and arrows in his hand.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>A man who has many sons is very happy,</p><p>like [MET] a soldier who has many arrows in his quiver is very happy.</p><p>If a man with his many grown sons is taken by his enemies to the place where they decide matters, his enemies will never be able to defeat that man,</p><p>
    because his sons will help to defend him.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-128"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-128">128</h3></a>

    <sup>2</sup>You will be able to earn the money that you [MTY] need to buy food;</p><p>you will be happy and you will be prosperous.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Your wife will be like a grapevine that bears many grapes [SIM];</p><p>she will give birth to many children.</p><p>Your children who sit around your table</p><p>will be like a strong olive tree that has many shoots growing up around it [SIM].</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Every man who reveres Yahweh</p><p>will be blessed like that.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>I wish/hope that Yahweh will bless all of you from where he dwells ◄on Zion Hill/in Jerusalem►</p><p>and that you will see the people of Jerusalem prospering every day that you live!</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>I desire that you will live many years,</p><p>long enough to see your grandchildren.</p><p>I desire/hope that things will go well for the people in Israel!</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-129"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-129">129</h3></a>

    <sup>1</sup>
    I say that my enemies have ◄afflicted/caused trouble for► me ever since I was young.</p><p>
    Now I ask you, my fellow Israelis, to repeat those same words:</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>“Our enemies have afflicted us since our nation began,</p><p>but they have not defeated us!</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    Our enemies struck us with whips that cut into our backs [MET]</p><p>like a farmer uses a plow to cut deep furrows into the ground.”</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    But Yahweh is righteous,</p><p>and he has freed me from being a slave [MTY] of wicked people.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>I wish/hope that all those who hate Jerusalem/Israel will be ashamed because of being defeated.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>I hope/wish that they will be of no value, like grass that grows on the roofs of houses</p><p>that dries up and does not grow tall;</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    as a result no one cuts it and puts it in bundles and carries it away.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>People who pass by and see men harvesting grain usually greet them by saying to them,</p><p>“We wish/hope that Yahweh will bless you!”</p><p>But this will not happen to those who hate Israel.</p><p>We, acting as Yahweh’s representatives, bless you Israelis.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-130"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-130">130</h3></a>

    <sup>3</sup>Yahweh, if you kept a record of the sins that we have committed,</p><p>not one of us [RHQ] would escape from being condemned and punished</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>But you forgive us,</p><p>with the result that we greatly revere you.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Yahweh has said that he would help/rescue me;</p><p>I trust what he said, and I wait eagerly for him to do that.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>I wait for Yahweh to help me</p><p>more than watchmen wait for the light to dawn;</p><p>yes, I wait more eagerly than they do!</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>You my fellow Israelis, confidently expect that Yahweh will bless us.</p><p>
    He will bless us because he faithfully loves us,</p><p>and he is very willing to save/rescue us.</p><p>

<p>A song to sing along the road up to Jerusalem</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh, do not forget King David</p><p>and all the hardships/troubles he endured!</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>He made a solemn promise to you,</p><p>the mighty God whom our ancestor Jacob worshiped.</p><p>

    <sup>4</sup>I will not sleep at all</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>until I build a place for Yahweh,</p><p>a home for the mighty God whom Jacob worshiped.”</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>In Bethlehem we heard news about the sacred chest.</p><p>We went and found it in the fields of Jearim city, and we took it to Jerusalem.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    Later we said, “Let’s go to the temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem;</p><p>let’s worship there in front of the throne where he sits.”</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Yahweh, come to the place where you live eternally,</p><p>to the place where your sacred chest is,</p><p>to that place that shows that you are very powerful.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>I want/desire that the righteous behavior of your priests will always be evident,</p><p>
    just like the beautiful robes that they wear [MET],</p><p>and that your people will always shout joyfully.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>You chose David to serve you as king of Israel;</p><p>do not reject/abandon him!</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Yahweh, you made a solemn promise to David,</p><p>a promise that you will not break.</p><p>You said, “I will cause your descendants to rule [MTY] as kings like you.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>If they keep my agreement with them</p><p>and obey all the commands that I will give them,</p><p>the line of kings descended from you will never end.”</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Yahweh has chosen Jerusalem;</p><p>he has wanted to make that city his home;</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>he said, “This is the city where I will live forever [DOU];</p><p>this is the place where I wanted to stay.</p><p>

    <sup>6</sup>Yahweh does whatever he desires to do,</p><p>in heaven and on the earth</p><p>and in the seas/oceans, down to the bottom of the seas.</p><p>

    <sup>8</sup>He is the one who killed all the firstborn males in Egypt,</p><p>the firstborn of people and of animals.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>There he performed many kinds of miracles [DOU]</p><p>to punish the king and all his officials.</p><p>

    <sup>11</sup>Sihon, the king of the Amor people-group,</p><p>and Og, the king of Bashan region,</p><p>and all the other kings in Canaan land.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Then he gave their land to us Israeli people</p><p>to belong to us forever.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Yahweh your name will endure forever,</p><p>and people who are not yet born will remember the great things that you have done.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>Yahweh, you declare that we your people ◄are innocent/have not done things that are wrong►,</p><p>and you are merciful to us.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>But the idols that the other people-groups worship are only statues made of silver and gold,</p><p>things that humans have made.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>Their idols have mouths, but they cannot say anything;</p><p>they have eyes, but they cannot see anything.</p><p>

    <sup>1</sup>When we had been taken to Babylonia, far from Jerusalem,</p><p>we sat down by the rivers there,</p><p>and we cried when we thought about the temple on Zion Hill in Jerusalem.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>On the willow trees alongside the rivers we hung our harps</p><p>
    because we did not want to play them any more because we were very sad.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>The soldiers who had captured us and taken us to Babylonia told us to sing for them;</p><p>they told us to ◄entertain them/make them happy►, saying,</p><p>“Sing for us one of the songs that you previously sang in Jerusalem!”</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>But we thought,</p><p>“We are sad because we have been punished by Yahweh and brought to this foreign land,</p><p>so we cannot [RHQ] sing songs about Yahweh while we are here!”</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>If I forget about Jerusalem [APO], Iet my right hand wither</p><p>
    with the result that I will be unable to play my harp</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Do not allow me to sing again [MTY],</p><p>if I forget about Jerusalem,</p><p>if I do not consider that Jerusalem causes me to be more joyful than anything else does.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Yahweh, punish the people of the Edom people-group</p><p>for what they did on the day that the army of Babylon captured Jerusalem.</p><p>Do not forget that they said,</p><p>“Tear down all the buildings! Destroy them completely! Leave only the foundations!”</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>And you people of Babylon, you will certainly be destroyed!</p><p>Those who punish you in return for what you did to us will be happy;</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>they will take your babies</p><p>and completely smash them on the rocks.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-138"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-138">138</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh, I thank you with all my inner being.</p><p>I sing to praise you in front of the idols of false gods to ridicule/belittle them.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>I bow down while I look towards your sacred temple,</p><p>and I thank you [MTY] because you faithfully love us and faithfully do all that you have promised.</p><p>You have shown that both you [MTY] and what you have promised to do are greater than anything else.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>On the day when I called out to you, you answered me;</p><p>you enabled me to be strong and brave.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Yahweh, some day all the kings of this earth will praise you,</p><p>because they will have heard what you have said.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>They will sing about what you have done;</p><p>they will sing and say that you are very great.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Yahweh, you are supreme,</p><p>but you take care of people who are considered to be unimportant.</p><p>And you know what proud people are doing,</p><p>even though they are far away from you and think that you do not see them.</p><p>

<p>A psalm written by David for the choir director</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh, you have examined me,</p><p>and you know everything about me.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>You know when I sit down and when I stand up.</p><p>
    Even though you are far away from me,</p><p>you know what I am thinking.</p><p>

    <sup>4</sup>Yahweh, even before I say [MTY] anything,</p><p>you know everything that I am going to say!</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>You protect me on all sides;</p><p>you put your hand on me to protect me with your power [MTY].</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>I am not able to understand that you know everything about me.</p><p>That is too great for me to really understand.</p><p>

    <sup>8</sup>If I went up to heaven, you would be there.</p><p>If I lay down in the place where the dead people are, you would be there.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>If I had wings and flew very far east [MTY],</p><p>or if I flew west and made a place to live on an island in the ocean,</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>you would be there also, to lead me by your hand,</p><p>and you would help me.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>I could request the darkness to hide me,</p><p>or I could request the light around me to become darkness,</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>but even if that happened, the darkness would not be darkness for you!</p><p>For you, the night is as bright as the daytime is,</p><p>because for you, daylight and darkness are ◄not different/the same►.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>You created all the parts of my body;</p><p>you put the parts of my body together when I was still in my mother’s womb.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>I praise you because you made my body in a very awesome and wonderful way.</p><p>Everything that you do is amazing!</p><p>I know that very well.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>When my body was being formed,</p><p>while it was being put together where no one else could see it,</p><p>you saw it!</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>You saw me before I was born.</p><p>You wrote in your book the number of days that you had decided that I would live.</p><p>You did that before any of those days had even started!</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>God, what you think about me is very precious (OR, is very hard to understand).</p><p>There is a great number of things that you think about.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>If I could count them, I would see that they are more than the grains of sand at the seashore.</p><p>And when I wake up, I am still with you</p><p>
    and I know that there are still more of your thoughts about me to count.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>God, I desire that you would kill all the wicked people!</p><p>And I wish that violent [MTY] men would ◄leave/go away from► me.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>They say wicked/malicious things about you;</p><p>they slander your name.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>Yahweh, I certainly [RHQ] hate those who hate you!</p><p>And I despise [RHQ] those who rebel against you.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>I hate them completely,</p><p>and I consider that they are my enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>God, search my inner being;</p><p>find out what I am thinking!</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>Find out whether there is anything evil in my inner being,</p><p>and lead me along the road that leads to my being with you forever.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-140"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-140">140</h3></a>
<p>A psalm written by David</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh, rescue/save me from being attacked by evil men;</p><p>and even more, ◄keep me safe/protect me► from being attacked by violent people.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>They are always planning to do evil things</p><p>and they are always inciting/urging people to start quarrels.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>By what they say [MTY] they injure people like poisonous snakes do;</p><p>the words that they speak [MTY] can kill people as easily as cobras/vipers do.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Yahweh, protect me from the power [MTY] of wicked people.</p><p>Keep me safe from violent men who plan to destroy me [SYN].</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    It is as though proud people have set a trap for me;</p><p>
    it is as though they have spread their nets to catch me;</p><p>
    it is as though they have put those things along the road to catch/seize me.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>I say to you, “Yahweh, you are my God;”</p><p>
    so listen to me while I cry out to you to help me.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Yahweh, my Lord, you are the one who defends me strongly;</p><p>you have protected me during battles [MET] as though you had put a helmet on my head.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Yahweh, do allow wicked people to do the things that they desire,</p><p>and do not allow them to do the evil things that they plan to do.</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    Do not allow my enemies to ◄become proud/defeat me►;</p><p>cause the evil things that they say [MTY] they will do to me to happen to them, instead.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Cause burning coals to fall on their heads!</p><p>Cause them to be thrown into deep pits, from which they cannot climb out!</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Do not allow those who slander others to succeed;</p><p>cause evil things to happen to violent men and destroy them!</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Yahweh, I know that you defend those who are oppressed,</p><p>and that you do what is just/fair for those who are needy/poor.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Righteous people will surely thank you [MTY],</p><p>and they will live ◄in your presence/with you►.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-141"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-141">141</h3></a>

    <sup>1</sup>Yahweh, I call out to you;</p><p>
    please help me quickly!</p><p>Listen to me when I am calling to you.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Accept my prayer as though it were incense being burned as an offering [SIM] to you.</p><p>And accept me while I lift up my hands to pray to you</p><p>like you accept sacrifices that I offer to you each evening [SIM].</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Yahweh, do not allow me to say [MTY] things that are wrong;</p><p>guard my lips.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Prevent me from wanting to do anything that is wrong,</p><p>and from joining with wicked men when they want to do evil deeds [DOU].</p><p>Do not even allow me to share in eating delightful food with them!</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>It is all right if righteous people strike/hit me or rebuke me</p><p>because they are trying to act kindly toward me to teach me to do what is right,</p><p>but I do not want wicked people to honor me by anointing my head with olive oil;</p><p>I am always praying that you will punish them because of the wicked deeds that they do.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>When their rulers are thrown down from the top of rocky cliffs,</p><p>people will know that what you, Yahweh, said about them is true.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Like a log that is split and cut into small pieces [SIM],</p><p>their shattered bones will be scattered on the ground near other graves.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>But Yahweh God, I continue to ask you to help me.</p><p>I ask you to protect me;</p><p>do not allow me to ◄die/be killed► now!</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    It is as though people have set traps for me;</p><p>protect me from falling into those traps,</p><p>
    It is as though they have spread nets to catch me;</p><p>keep me from being caught in those nets.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>I desire that wicked people will fall into the traps they have set to catch me</p><p>while I escape from them.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-142"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-142">142</h3></a>
<p>A psalm that David prayed when he was hiding in a cave</p><p>

    <sup>3</sup>When I am very discouraged,</p><p>you know what I should do.</p><p>Wherever I walk, it is as though my enemies have hidden traps for me to fall into.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>I look around,</p><p>but there is no one who pays attention to me,</p><p>no one who will protect me,</p><p>no one who cares about what happens to me.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    So Yahweh, I cry out to you to help me;</p><p>you are the one who protects me;</p><p>and you are all that I need while I am alive.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Listen to me while I cry out to you for help,</p><p>because I am very distressed.</p><p>Rescue/Save me from those who are pursuing me,</p><p>because they are very strong,</p><p>with the result that I cannot escape from them.</p><p>

    <sup>3</sup>
    My enemies have pursued me;</p><p>they have completely defeated me.</p><p>
    It is as though they have put me in a dark prison,</p><p>where I have nothing good to ◄hope for/expect►, like those who died long ago [SIM].</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>So I am very discouraged;</p><p>I am very dismayed/worried.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>I remember what has happened previously:</p><p>I ◄meditate on/think about► all the things that you have done;</p><p>I consider all the great deeds that you [SYN] have performed.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>I lift up my hands/arms to you while I pray;</p><p>I [SYN] need you, like very dry ground needs rain [SIM].</p><p>(Think about that!)</p><p>

    <sup>9</sup>Yahweh, I have gone/run to you to be protected,</p><p>
    so rescue me from my enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>You are my God;</p><p>teach me to do what you want me to do.</p><p>I want your good Spirit to lead me on a path that is not difficult to walk on.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Yahweh, restore me when I am close to dying, as you promised to do.</p><p>Because you are righteous/good, rescue me from my troubles/difficulties!</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>I am one who serves you;</p><p>so because you faithfully love me,</p><p>kill my enemies</p><p>and get rid of all those who ◄oppress/cause trouble for► me.</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-144"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-144">144</h3></a>

    <sup>6</sup>Cause lightning to flash with the result that your enemies will run away!</p><p>Shoot your arrows at them and cause them to ◄run away/scatter►.</p><p>

    It is as though my enemies surround me like a flood;</p><p>reach your hand down from heaven</p><p>and rescue me from them [SYN].</p><p>They are men from other countries</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>who [SYN] always tell lies.</p><p>
    Even in a courtroom where they swear to tell the truth</p><p>they tell lies.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>God, I will sing a new song to you,</p><p>and I will play my ten-stringed harp while I sing to you.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>You enable kings to defeat their enemies;</p><p>and you rescued me, your servant David, from being killed by my enemies’ swords.</p><p>

    So I ask you to save me from being killed by the swords that those evil people carry.</p><p>Rescue me from the power [MTY] of those foreigners</p><p>who [SYN] always tell lies,</p><p>and who raise their right hands in courtrooms when they solemnly declare that they will tell the truth.</p><p>

    <sup>7</sup>Thank Yahweh while you are singing to him to praise him;</p><p>on the harps, play music to our God.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>He covers the sky with clouds,</p><p>
    and then he sends rain to the earth</p><p>and causes grass to grow on the hills.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>He gives to animals the food that they need,</p><p>and gives food to young crows/birds when they cry out because they are hungry.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>He is not pleased with strong horses</p><p>or with men who can run [MTY] fast.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Instead, what pleases him are those who revere him,</p><p>those who confidently expect him to continue to faithfully love them.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    You people of [APO] Jerusalem, praise Yahweh!</p><p>Praise your God!</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>He guards your city by keeping its gates strong.</p><p>He blesses the people who live there.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>He protects the borders of your country, so that enemies from other countries cannot attack you.</p><p>He gives you plenty of very good wheat/grain to eat.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>He commands what he wants to be done on the earth,</p><p>and his words quickly come to the place to which he sends them.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>He sends snow which covers the ground like a white wool blanket [SIM],</p><p>and he scatters frost on the ground like wind scatters ashes [SIM].</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>He sends hail down like ◄pebbles/tiny stones►;</p><p>
    when that happens, ◄it is very difficult to endure because the air becomes very cold./who can endure because the air becomes very cold?► [RHQ]</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    But he commands the wind to blow, and it blows.</p><p>
    Then the hail melts and the water flows into the streams.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>He sent his message to the descendants of Jacob;</p><p>
    he tells to his Israeli people the laws and regulations that he had decreed.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>He has not done that for any other nation;</p><p>the other nations do not know his laws.</p><p>Praise Yahweh!</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-148"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-148">148</h3></a>

    <sup>13</sup>I want them all to praise Yahweh [MTY]</p><p>because he is greater than anyone else.</p><p>His glory is greater than anything on the earth or in heaven.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>He caused us, his people, to be strong</p><p>in order that we, his people,</p><p>we Israeli people ◄who are very precious to him/whom he loves very much►,</p><p>would praise him.</p><p>So praise Yahweh!</p><a href="#PSALMS-c-149"><h3 id="PSALMS-c-149">149</h3></a>

    <sup>3</sup>Praise Yahweh by dancing, by beating/playing tambourines,</p><p>and by playing harps to praise him!</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Yahweh is pleased with his people;</p><p>he honors humble people by helping them to defeat their enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>God’s people should rejoice because they have won battles</p><p>and they should sing joyfully all during the night!</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>They [MTY] should shout loudly to praise God;</p><p>but they should also hold sharp swords in their hands,</p><p>
