<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job. That man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God,<sup><a href="#footnote-0" id="ref-0">†</a></sup> and turned away from evil. <sup>2</sup>There were born to him seven sons and three daughters. <sup>3</sup>His possessions also were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east. <sup>4</sup>His sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. <sup>5</sup>It was so, when the days of their feasting had run their course, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, “It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their hearts.” Job did so continually.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    Now on the day when God’s sons came to present themselves before Yahweh,<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="ref-1">†</a></sup> Satan also came among them. <sup>7</sup>Yahweh said to Satan, “Where have you come from?”</p><p>
    Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.”</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    Yahweh said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant, Job? For there is no one like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil.”</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing? <sup>10</sup>Haven’t you made a hedge around him, and around his house, and around all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. <sup>11</sup>But stretch out your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will renounce you to your face.”</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    Yahweh said to Satan, “Behold,<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="ref-2">†</a></sup> all that he has is in your power. Only on himself don’t stretch out your hand.”</p><p>
    So Satan went out from the presence of Yahweh. <sup>13</sup>It fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, <sup>14</sup>that a messenger came to Job, and said, “The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys feeding beside them, <sup>15</sup>and the Sabeans attacked, and took them away. Yes, they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The fire of God has fallen from the sky, and has burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The Chaldeans made three bands, and swept down on the camels, and have taken them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you.”</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    While he was still speaking, there came also another, and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, <sup>19</sup>and behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young men, and they are dead. I alone have escaped to tell you.”</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    Then Job arose, and tore his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshiped. <sup>21</sup>He said, “Naked I came out of my mother’s womb, and naked will I return there. Yahweh gave, and Yahweh has taken away. Blessed be Yahweh’s name.” <sup>22</sup>In all this, Job didn’t sin, nor charge God with wrongdoing.</p><a href="#Job-c-2"><h3 id="Job-c-2">2</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Again, on the day when God’s sons came to present themselves before Yahweh, Satan came also among them to present himself before Yahweh. <sup>2</sup>Yahweh said to Satan, “Where have you come from?”</p><p>
    Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.”</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    Yahweh said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? For there is no one like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil. He still maintains his integrity, although you incited me against him, to ruin him without cause.”</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “Skin for skin. Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life. <sup>5</sup>But stretch out your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce you to your face.”</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    Yahweh said to Satan, “Behold, he is in your hand. Only spare his life.”</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    So Satan went out from the presence of Yahweh, and struck Job with painful sores from the sole of his foot to his head. <sup>8</sup>He took for himself a potsherd to scrape himself with, and he sat among the ashes. <sup>9</sup>Then his wife said to him, “Do you still maintain your integrity? Renounce God, and die.”</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    But he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?”</p><p>
    In all this Job didn’t sin with his lips. <sup>11</sup>Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that had come on him, they each came from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to sympathize with him and to comfort him. <sup>12</sup>When they lifted up their eyes from a distance, and didn’t recognize him, they raised their voices, and wept; and they each tore his robe, and sprinkled dust on their heads toward the sky. <sup>13</sup>So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great.</p><a href="#Job-c-3"><h3 id="Job-c-3">3</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed the day of his birth. <sup>2</sup>Job answered:</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>“Let the day perish in which I was born,</p><p>
    the night which said, ‘There is a boy conceived.’</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    Let that day be darkness.</p><p>Don’t let God from above seek for it,</p><p>neither let the light shine on it.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own.</p><p>
    Let a cloud dwell on it.</p><p>
    Let all that makes the day black terrify it.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    As for that night, let thick darkness seize on it.</p><p>Let it not rejoice among the days of the year.</p><p>Let it not come into the number of the months.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    Behold, let that night be barren.</p><p>
    Let no joyful voice come therein.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Let them curse it who curse the day,</p><p>who are ready to rouse up leviathan.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    Let the stars of its twilight be dark.</p><p>
    Let it look for light, but have none,</p><p>neither let it see the eyelids of the morning,</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    because it didn’t shut up the doors of my mother’s womb,</p><p>
    nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>“Why didn’t I die from the womb?</p><p>
    Why didn’t I give up the spirit when my mother bore me?</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    Why did the knees receive me?</p><p>
    Or why the breast, that I should nurse?</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    For now I should have lain down and been quiet.</p><p>
    I should have slept, then I would have been at rest,</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    with kings and counselors of the earth,</p><p>
    who built up waste places for themselves;</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    or with princes who had gold,</p><p>
    who filled their houses with silver;</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been,</p><p>
    as infants who never saw light.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    There the wicked cease from troubling.</p><p>
    There the weary are at rest.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>There the prisoners are at ease together.</p><p>
    They don’t hear the voice of the taskmaster.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    The small and the great are there.</p><p>
    The servant is free from his master.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>“Why is light given to him who is in misery,</p><p>
    life to the bitter in soul,</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>who long for death, but it doesn’t come;</p><p>
    and dig for it more than for hidden treasures,</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    who rejoice exceedingly,</p><p>
    and are glad, when they can find the grave?</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden,</p><p>
    whom God has hedged in?</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    For my sighing comes before I eat.</p><p>
    My groanings are poured out like water.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    For the thing which I fear comes on me,</p><p>
    that which I am afraid of comes to me.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither do I have rest;</p><p>
    but trouble comes.”</p><a href="#Job-c-4"><h3 id="Job-c-4">4</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>“If someone ventures to talk with you, will you be grieved?</p><p>But who can withhold himself from speaking?</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    Behold, you have instructed many,</p><p>
    you have strengthened the weak hands.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    Your words have supported him who was falling,</p><p>
    you have made the feeble knees firm.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    But now it has come to you, and you faint.</p><p>
    It touches you, and you are troubled.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Isn’t your piety your confidence?</p><p>Isn’t the integrity of your ways your hope?</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>“Remember, now, who ever perished, being innocent?</p><p>
    Or where were the upright cut off?</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity</p><p>
    and sow trouble, reap the same.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    By the breath of God they perish.</p><p>
    By the blast of his anger are they consumed.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    The roaring of the lion,</p><p>
    and the voice of the fierce lion,</p><p>
    the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    The old lion perishes for lack of prey.</p><p>
    The cubs of the lioness are scattered abroad.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>“Now a thing was secretly brought to me.</p><p>
    My ear received a whisper of it.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    In thoughts from the visions of the night,</p><p>
    when deep sleep falls on men,</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    fear came on me, and trembling,</p><p>which made all my bones shake.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    Then a spirit passed before my face.</p><p>
    The hair of my flesh stood up.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    It stood still, but I couldn’t discern its appearance.</p><p>
    A form was before my eyes.</p><p>
    Silence, then I heard a voice, saying,</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>‘Shall mortal man be more just than God?</p><p>
    Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    Behold, he puts no trust in his servants.</p><p>
    He charges his angels with error.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>How much more those who dwell in houses of clay,</p><p>whose foundation is in the dust,</p><p>who are crushed before the moth!</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>Between morning and evening they are destroyed.</p><p>
    They perish forever without any regarding it.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>Isn’t their tent cord plucked up within them?</p><p>
    They die, and that without wisdom.’</p><a href="#Job-c-5"><h3 id="Job-c-5">5</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>“Call now; is there any who will answer you?</p><p>
    To which of the holy ones will you turn?</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    For resentment kills the foolish man,</p><p>
    and jealousy kills the simple.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    I have seen the foolish taking root,</p><p>
    but suddenly I cursed his habitation.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    His children are far from safety.</p><p>
    They are crushed in the gate.</p><p>
    Neither is there any to deliver them,</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>whose harvest the hungry eat up,</p><p>
    and take it even out of the thorns.</p><p>
    The snare gapes for their substance.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    For affliction doesn’t come out of the dust,</p><p>
    neither does trouble spring out of the ground;</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    but man is born to trouble,</p><p>
    as the sparks fly upward.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>“But as for me, I would seek God.</p><p>
    I would commit my cause to God,</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    who does great things that can’t be fathomed,</p><p>
    marvelous things without number;</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>who gives rain on the earth,</p><p>
    and sends waters on the fields;</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    so that he sets up on high those who are low,</p><p>those who mourn are exalted to safety.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    He frustrates the plans of the crafty,</p><p>
    so that their hands can’t perform their enterprise.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>He takes the wise in their own craftiness;</p><p>
    the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    They meet with darkness in the day time,</p><p>
    and grope at noonday as in the night.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>But he saves from the sword of their mouth,</p><p>even the needy from the hand of the mighty.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    So the poor has hope,</p><p>
    and injustice shuts her mouth.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>“Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects.</p><p>Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    For he wounds and binds up.</p><p>
    He injures and his hands make whole.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    He will deliver you in six troubles;</p><p>yes, in seven no evil will touch you.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    In famine he will redeem you from death;</p><p>
    in war, from the power of the sword.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue,</p><p>
    neither will you be afraid of destruction when it comes.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    You will laugh at destruction and famine,</p><p>neither will you be afraid of the animals of the earth.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    For you will be allied with the stones of the field.</p><p>
    The animals of the field will be at peace with you.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    You will know that your tent is in peace.</p><p>
    You will visit your fold, and will miss nothing.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    You will know also that your offspring<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="ref-3">†</a></sup> will be great,</p><p>
    your offspring as the grass of the earth.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    You will come to your grave in a full age,</p><p>
    like a shock of grain comes in its season.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>
    Behold, we have researched it. It is so.</p><p>
    Hear it, and know it for your good.”</p><a href="#Job-c-6"><h3 id="Job-c-6">6</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Then Job answered,</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>“Oh that my anguish were weighed,</p><p>
    and all my calamity laid in the balances!</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas,</p><p>
    therefore my words have been rash.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    For the arrows of the Almighty are within me.</p><p>
    My spirit drinks up their poison.</p><p>
    The terrors of God set themselves in array against me.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass?</p><p>
    Or does the ox low over his fodder?</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    Can that which has no flavor be eaten without salt?</p><p>Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    My soul refuses to touch them.</p><p>
    They are as loathsome food to me.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>“Oh that I might have my request,</p><p>
    that God would grant the thing that I long for,</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>even that it would please God to crush me;</p><p>
    that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    Let it still be my consolation,</p><p>
    yes, let me exult in pain that doesn’t spare,</p><p>
    that I have not denied the words of the Holy One.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    What is my strength, that I should wait?</p><p>
    What is my end, that I should be patient?</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    Is my strength the strength of stones?</p><p>
    Or is my flesh of bronze?</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Isn’t it that I have no help in me,</p><p>
    that wisdom is driven away from me?</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>“To him who is ready to faint, kindness should be shown from his friend;</p><p>
    even to him who forsakes the fear of the Almighty.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    My brothers have dealt deceitfully as a brook,</p><p>
    as the channel of brooks that pass away;</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>which are black by reason of the ice,</p><p>
    in which the snow hides itself.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    In the dry season, they vanish.</p><p>
    When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    The caravans that travel beside them turn away.</p><p>
    They go up into the waste, and perish.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    The caravans of Tema looked.</p><p>
    The companies of Sheba waited for them.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    They were distressed because they were confident.</p><p>
    They came there, and were confounded.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    For now you are nothing.</p><p>
    You see a terror, and are afraid.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>Did I ever say, ‘Give to me’?</p><p>
    or, ‘Offer a present for me from your substance’?</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    or, ‘Deliver me from the adversary’s hand’?</p><p>
    or, ‘Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors’?</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>“Teach me, and I will hold my peace.</p><p>Cause me to understand my error.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    How forcible are words of uprightness!</p><p>
    But your reproof, what does it reprove?</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>Do you intend to reprove words,</p><p>since the speeches of one who is desperate are as wind?</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>Yes, you would even cast lots for the fatherless,</p><p>
    and make merchandise of your friend.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>
    Now therefore be pleased to look at me,</p><p>
    for surely I will not lie to your face.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>
    Please return.</p><p>
    Let there be no injustice.</p><p>Yes, return again.</p><p>
    My cause is righteous.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>
    Is there injustice on my tongue?</p><p>
    Can’t my taste discern mischievous things?</p><a href="#Job-c-7"><h3 id="Job-c-7">7</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>“Isn’t a man forced to labor on earth?</p><p>Aren’t his days like the days of a hired hand?</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    As a servant who earnestly desires the shadow,</p><p>
    as a hireling who looks for his wages,</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    so I am made to possess months of misery,</p><p>
    wearisome nights are appointed to me.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    When I lie down, I say,</p><p>‘When will I arise, and the night be gone?’</p><p>
    I toss and turn until the dawning of the day.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust.</p><p>
    My skin closes up, and breaks out afresh.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle,</p><p>
    and are spent without hope.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Oh remember that my life is a breath.</p><p>
    My eye will no more see good.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    The eye of him who sees me will see me no more.</p><p>
    Your eyes will be on me, but I will not be.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away,</p><p>
    so he who goes down to Sheol<sup><a href="#footnote-4" id="ref-4">†</a></sup> will come up no more.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    He will return no more to his house,</p><p>
    neither will his place know him any more.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>“Therefore I will not keep silent.</p><p>
    I will speak in the anguish of my spirit.</p><p>
    I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Am I a sea, or a sea monster,</p><p>
    that you put a guard over me?</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    When I say, ‘My bed will comfort me.</p><p>
    My couch will ease my complaint,’</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>then you scare me with dreams</p><p>
    and terrify me through visions,</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>so that my soul chooses strangling,</p><p>
    death rather than my bones.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    I loathe my life.</p><p>
    I don’t want to live forever.</p><p>
    Leave me alone, for my days are but a breath.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    What is man, that you should magnify him,</p><p>
    that you should set your mind on him,</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    that you should visit him every morning,</p><p>
    and test him every moment?</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    How long will you not look away from me,</p><p>
    nor leave me alone until I swallow down my spittle?</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    If I have sinned, what do I do to you, you watcher of men?</p><p>
    Why have you set me as a mark for you,</p><p>
    so that I am a burden to myself?</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    Why do you not pardon my disobedience, and take away my iniquity?</p><p>
    For now will I lie down in the dust.</p><p>
    You will seek me diligently, but I will not be.”</p><a href="#Job-c-8"><h3 id="Job-c-8">8</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>“How long will you speak these things?</p><p>
    Shall the words of your mouth be a mighty wind?</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Does God pervert justice?</p><p>
    Or does the Almighty pervert righteousness?</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    If your children have sinned against him,</p><p>
    he has delivered them into the hand of their disobedience.</p><p>

    Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>“Should a wise man answer with vain knowledge,</p><p>
    and fill himself with the east wind?</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Should he reason with unprofitable talk,</p><p>
    or with speeches with which he can do no good?</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Yes, you do away with fear,</p><p>
    and hinder devotion before God.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    For your iniquity teaches your mouth,</p><p>
    and you choose the language of the crafty.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    Your own mouth condemns you, and not I.</p><p>Yes, your own lips testify against you.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>“Are you the first man who was born?</p><p>Or were you brought out before the hills?</p><p>

    <sup>9</sup>
    What do you know that we don’t know?</p><p>
    What do you understand which is not in us?</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men,</p><p>
    much older than your father.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    Are the consolations of God too small for you,</p><p>even the word that is gentle toward you?</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    Why does your heart carry you away?</p><p>
    Why do your eyes flash,</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    that you turn your spirit against God,</p><p>
    and let such words go out of your mouth?</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    What is man, that he should be clean?</p><p>
    What is he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    Behold, he puts no trust in his holy ones.</p><p>
    Yes, the heavens are not clean in his sight;</p><p>

    A sound of terrors is in his ears.</p><p>
    In prosperity the destroyer will come on him.</p><p>

    He doesn’t believe that he will return out of darkness.</p><p>

    He wanders abroad for bread, saying, ‘Where is it?’</p><p>
    He knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    Distress and anguish make him afraid.</p><p>
    They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    Because he has stretched out his hand against God,</p><p>
    and behaves himself proudly against the Almighty,</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>he runs at him with a stiff neck,</p><p>
    with the thick shields of his bucklers,</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>
    because he has covered his face with his fatness,</p><p>
    and gathered fat on his thighs.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>
    He has lived in desolate cities,</p><p>
    in houses which no one inhabited,</p><p>
    which were ready to become heaps.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>
    He will not be rich, neither will his substance continue,</p><p>
    neither will their possessions be extended on the earth.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>
    He will not depart out of darkness.</p><p>
    The flame will dry up his branches.</p><p>
    He will go away by the breath of God’s mouth.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>
    Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself,</p><p>
    for emptiness will be his reward.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>
    It will be accomplished before his time.</p><p>
    His branch will not be green.</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>He will shake off his unripe grape as the vine,</p><p>
    and will cast off his flower as the olive tree.</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>
    For the company of the godless will be barren,</p><p>

    He runs at me like a giant.</p><p>

    when I prepared my seat in the street.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    The young men saw me and hid themselves.</p><p>
    The aged rose up and stood.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    The princes refrained from talking,</p><p>
    and laid their hand on their mouth.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    The voice of the nobles was hushed,</p><p>
    and their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me,</p><p>
    and when the eye saw me, it commended me,</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    because I delivered the poor who cried,</p><p>
    and the fatherless also, who had no one to help him,</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    the blessing of him who was ready to perish came on me,</p><p>
    and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>I put on righteousness, and it clothed me.</p><p>
    My justice was as a robe and a diadem.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    I was eyes to the blind,</p><p>
    and feet to the lame.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    I was a father to the needy.</p><p>
    I researched the cause of him whom I didn’t know.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    I broke the jaws of the unrighteous</p><p>
    and plucked the prey out of his teeth.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    Then I said, ‘I will die in my own house,</p><p>
    I will count my days as the sand.</p><p>

    My root is spread out to the waters.</p><p>
    The dew lies all night on my branch.</p><p>

    <sup>21</sup>“Men listened to me, waited,</p><p>

    <sup>22</sup>
    After my words they didn’t speak again.</p><p>
    My speech fell on them.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    They waited for me as for the rain.</p><p>
    Their mouths drank as with the spring rain.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    I smiled on them when they had no confidence.</p><p>
    They didn’t reject the light of my face.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    I chose out their way, and sat as chief.</p><p>

    <sup>1</sup>
    So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. <sup>2</sup>Then the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel, the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was kindled against Job. His wrath was kindled because he justified himself rather than God. <sup>3</sup>Also his wrath was kindled against his three friends, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job. <sup>4</sup>Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job, because they were older than he. <sup>5</sup>When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered,</p><p>“I am young, and you are very old.</p><p>
    Therefore I held back, and didn’t dare show you my opinion.</p><p>

    I said, ‘Days should speak,</p><p>

    <sup>9</sup>
    It is not the great who are wise,</p><p>
    nor the aged who understand justice.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    Therefore I said, ‘Listen to me;</p><p>
    I also will show my opinion.’</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>“Behold, I waited for your words,</p><p>
    and I listened for your reasoning,</p><p>

    <sup>12</sup>
    Yes, I gave you my full attention,</p><p>
    but there was no one who convinced Job,</p><p>
    or who answered his words, among you.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    Beware lest you say, ‘We have found wisdom.</p><p>
    God may refute him, not man;’</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>

    <sup>12</sup>“Behold, I will answer you. In this you are not just,</p><p>

    <sup>13</sup>
    Why do you strive against him,</p><p>
    because he doesn’t give account of any of his matters?</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>

    yes twice, though man pays no attention.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    In a dream, in a vision of the night,</p><p>
    when deep sleep falls on men,</p><p>

    He keeps back his soul from the pit,</p><p>

    <sup>19</sup>“He is chastened also with pain on his bed,</p><p>
    with continual strife in his bones,</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>so that his life abhors bread,</p><p>
    and his soul dainty food.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    His flesh is so consumed away that it can’t be seen.</p><p>
    His bones that were not seen stick out.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>Yes, his soul draws near to the pit,</p><p>
    and his life to the destroyers.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>“If there is beside him an angel,</p><p>
    an interpreter, one among a thousand,</p><p>

    <sup>25</sup>
    His flesh will be fresher than a child’s.</p><p>

    He prays to God, and he is favorable to him,</p><p>

    He restores to man his righteousness.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>
    He sings before men, and says,</p><p>‘I have sinned, and perverted that which was right,</p><p>

    <sup>4</sup>Let us choose for us that which is right.</p><p>Let us know among ourselves what is good.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    For Job has said, ‘I am righteous,</p><p>God has taken away my right.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Notwithstanding my right I am considered a liar.</p><p>
    My wound is incurable, though I am without disobedience.’</p><p>

    What man is like Job,</p><p>
    who drinks scorn like water,</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>who goes in company with the workers of iniquity,</p><p>
    and walks with wicked men?</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    For he has said, ‘It profits a man nothing</p><p>
    that he should delight himself with God.’</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>“Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding:</p><p>
    far be it from God, that he should do wickedness,</p><p>
    from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    For the work of a man he will give to him,</p><p>
    and cause every man to find according to his ways.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Yes surely, God will not do wickedly,</p><p>
    neither will the Almighty pervert justice.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    Who put him in charge of the earth?</p><p>
    Or who has appointed him over the whole world?</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    If he set his heart on himself,</p><p>
    if he gathered to himself his spirit and his breath,</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    all flesh would perish together,</p><p>
    and man would turn again to dust.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>“If now you have understanding, hear this.</p><p>
    Listen to the voice of my words.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Should even one who hates justice govern?</p><p>
    Will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty,</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    who says to a king, ‘Vile!’</p><p>
    or to nobles, ‘Wicked!’?</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    He doesn’t respect the persons of princes,</p><p>
    nor respect the rich more than the poor,</p><p>
    for they all are the work of his hands.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    In a moment they die, even at midnight.</p><p>
    The people are shaken and pass away.</p><p>
    The mighty are taken away without a hand.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>“For his eyes are on the ways of a man.</p><p>

    There is no darkness, nor thick gloom,</p><p>

    <sup>23</sup>
    For he doesn’t need to consider a man further,</p><p>
    that he should go before God in judgment.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    He breaks mighty men in pieces in ways past finding out,</p><p>
    and sets others in their place.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    Therefore he takes knowledge of their works.</p><p>
    He overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed.</p><p>

    He strikes them as wicked men</p><p>
    in the open sight of others;</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>
    because they turned away from following him,</p><p>
    and wouldn’t pay attention to any of his ways,</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>
    so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him.</p><p>
    He heard the cry of the afflicted.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>
    When he gives quietness, who then can condemn?</p><p>
    When he hides his face, who then can see him?</p><p>
    He is over a nation or a man alike,</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>
    that the godless man may not reign,</p><p>
    that there be no one to ensnare the people.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>“For has any said to God,</p><p>‘I am guilty, but I will not offend any more.</p><p>

    Teach me that which I don’t see.</p><p>If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more’?</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>
    Shall his recompense be as you desire, that you refuse it?</p><p>
    For you must choose, and not I.</p><p>
    Therefore speak what you know.</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>
    Men of understanding will tell me,</p><p>yes, every wise man who hears me:</p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>‘Job speaks without knowledge.</p><p>
    His words are without wisdom.’</p><p>
    <sup>36</sup>
    I wish that Job were tried to the end,</p><p>
    because of his answering like wicked men.</p><p>
    <sup>37</sup>
    For he adds rebellion to his sin.</p><p>
    He claps his hands among us,</p><p>

    <sup>1</sup>Moreover Elihu answered,</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>“Do you think this to be your right,</p><p>
    or do you say, ‘My righteousness is more than God’s,’</p><p>

    that you ask, ‘What advantage will it be to you?</p><p>
    What profit will I have, more than if I had sinned?’</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>I will answer you,</p><p>
    and your companions with you.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Look to the skies, and see.</p><p>
    See the skies, which are higher than you.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    If you have sinned, what effect do you have against him?</p><p>
    If your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to him?</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>If you are righteous, what do you give him?</p><p>
    Or what does he receive from your hand?</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    Your wickedness may hurt a man as you are,</p><p>
    and your righteousness may profit a son of man.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>“By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out.</p><p>
    They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    But no one says, ‘Where is God my Maker,</p><p>
    who gives songs in the night,</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>who teaches us more than the animals of the earth,</p><p>
    and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky?’</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    There they cry, but no one answers,</p><p>
    because of the pride of evil men.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    Surely God will not hear an empty cry,</p><p>
    neither will the Almighty regard it.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    How much less when you say you don’t see him.</p><p>
    The cause is before him, and you wait for him!</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    But now, because he has not visited in his anger,</p><p>
    neither does he greatly regard arrogance,</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>therefore Job opens his mouth with empty talk,</p><p>
    and he multiplies words without knowledge.”</p><a href="#Job-c-36"><h3 id="Job-c-36">36</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>Elihu also continued, and said,</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>“Bear with me a little, and I will show you;</p><p>

    <sup>3</sup>
    I will get my knowledge from afar,</p><p>
    and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    For truly my words are not false.</p><p>
    One who is perfect in knowledge is with you.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>“Behold, God is mighty, and doesn’t despise anyone.</p><p>
    He is mighty in strength of understanding.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    He doesn’t preserve the life of the wicked,</p><p>
    but gives justice to the afflicted.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    He doesn’t withdraw his eyes from the righteous,</p><p>
    but with kings on the throne,</p><p>
    he sets them forever, and they are exalted.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>If they are bound in fetters,</p><p>
    and are taken in the cords of afflictions,</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    then he shows them their work,</p><p>
    and their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    He also opens their ears to instruction,</p><p>
    and commands that they return from iniquity.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>If they listen and serve him,</p><p>
    they will spend their days in prosperity,</p><p>
    and their years in pleasures.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    But if they don’t listen, they will perish by the sword;</p><p>
    they will die without knowledge.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>“But those who are godless in heart lay up anger.</p><p>
    They don’t cry for help when he binds them.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    They die in youth.</p><p>
    Their life perishes among the unclean.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>He delivers the afflicted by their affliction,</p><p>
    and opens their ear in oppression.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>Yes, he would have allured you out of distress,</p><p>into a wide place, where there is no restriction.</p><p>
    That which is set on your table would be full of fatness.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>“But you are full of the judgment of the wicked.</p><p>
    Judgment and justice take hold of you.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>Don’t let riches entice you to wrath,</p><p>neither let the great size of a bribe turn you aside.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    Would your wealth sustain you in distress,</p><p>
    or all the might of your strength?</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>Don’t desire the night,</p><p>
    when people are cut off in their place.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    Take heed, don’t regard iniquity;</p><p>
    for you have chosen this rather than affliction.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    Behold, God is exalted in his power.</p><p>
    Who is a teacher like him?</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    Who has prescribed his way for him?</p><p>
    Or who can say, ‘You have committed unrighteousness’?</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>“Remember that you magnify his work,</p><p>about which men have sung.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    All men have looked on it.</p><p>
    Man sees it afar off.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    Behold, God is great, and we don’t know him.</p><p>
    The number of his years is unsearchable.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>
    For he draws up the drops of water,</p><p>

    <sup>28</sup>
    which the skies pour down</p><p>
    and which drop on man abundantly.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>Indeed, can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds</p><p>

    Behold, he spreads his light around him.</p><p>
    He covers the bottom of the sea.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>
    For by these he judges the people.</p><p>
    He gives food in abundance.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>
    He covers his hands with the lightning,</p><p>
    and commands it to strike the mark.</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>
    Its noise tells about him,</p><p>

    He sends it out under the whole sky,</p><p>

    <sup>5</sup>
    God thunders marvelously with his voice.</p><p>
    He does great things, which we can’t comprehend.</p><p>

    He seals up the hand of every man,</p><p>

    He who made him gives him his sword.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    Surely the mountains produce food for him,</p><p>
    where all the animals of the field play.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    He lies under the lotus trees,</p><p>
    in the covert of the reed, and the marsh.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    The lotuses cover him with their shade.</p><p>
    The willows of the brook surround him.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    Behold, if a river overflows, he doesn’t tremble.</p><p>
    He is confident, though the Jordan swells even to his mouth.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    Shall any take him when he is on the watch,</p><p>or pierce through his nose with a snare?</p><a href="#Job-c-41"><h3 id="Job-c-41">41</h3></a>

    <sup>1</sup>“Can you draw out Leviathan<sup><a href="#footnote-16" id="ref-16">†</a></sup> with a fish hook,</p><p>
    or press down his tongue with a cord?</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    Can you put a rope into his nose,</p><p>
    or pierce his jaw through with a hook?</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    Will he make many petitions to you,</p><p>
    or will he speak soft words to you?</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    Will he make a covenant with you,</p><p>
    that you should take him for a servant forever?</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Will you play with him as with a bird?</p><p>
    Or will you bind him for your girls?</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    Will traders barter for him?</p><p>
    Will they part him among the merchants?</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Can you fill his skin with barbed irons,</p><p>
    or his head with fish spears?</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Lay your hand on him.</p><p>Remember the battle, and do so no more.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    Behold, the hope of him is in vain.</p><p>Won’t one be cast down even at the sight of him?</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>None is so fierce that he dare stir him up.</p><p>Who then is he who can stand before me?</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    Who has first given to me, that I should repay him?</p><p>Everything under the heavens is mine.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>“I will not keep silence concerning his limbs,</p><p>nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    Who can strip off his outer garment?</p><p>
    Who will come within his jaws?</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>Who can open the doors of his face?</p><p>
    Around his teeth is terror.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    Strong scales are his pride,</p><p>shut up together with a close seal.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>One is so near to another,</p><p>
    that no air can come between them.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    They are joined to one another.</p><p>
    They stick together, so that they can’t be pulled apart.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    His sneezing flashes out light.</p><p>
    His eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    Out of his mouth go burning torches.</p><p>Sparks of fire leap out.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    Out of his nostrils a smoke goes,</p><p>
    as of a boiling pot over a fire of reeds.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    His breath kindles coals.</p><p>
    A flame goes out of his mouth.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    There is strength in his neck.</p><p>Terror dances before him.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    The flakes of his flesh are joined together.</p><p>
    They are firm on him.</p><p>
    They can’t be moved.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    His heart is as firm as a stone,</p><p>yes, firm as the lower millstone.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid.</p><p>
    They retreat before his thrashing.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    If one attacks him with the sword, it can’t prevail;</p><p>
    nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>He counts iron as straw,</p><p>and bronze as rotten wood.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>The arrow can’t make him flee.</p><p>Sling stones are like chaff to him.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>Clubs are counted as stubble.</p><p>He laughs at the rushing of the javelin.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>His undersides are like sharp potsherds,</p><p>leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>He makes the deep to boil like a pot.</p><p>He makes the sea like a pot of ointment.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>He makes a path shine after him.</p><p>One would think the deep had white hair.</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>On earth there is not his equal,</p><p>that is made without fear.</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>He sees everything that is high.</p><p>He is king over all the sons of pride.”</p><a href="#Job-c-42"><h3 id="Job-c-42">42</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Then Job answered Yahweh:</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>“I know that you can do all things,</p><p>
    and that no purpose of yours can be restrained.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    You asked, ‘Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge?’</p><p>
    therefore I have uttered that which I didn’t understand,</p><p>
    things too wonderful for me, which I didn’t know.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    You said, ‘Listen, now, and I will speak;</p><p>
    I will question you, and you will answer me.’</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear,</p><p>
    but now my eye sees you.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    Therefore I abhor myself,</p><p>
    and repent in dust and ashes.”</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    It was so, that after Yahweh had spoken these words to Job, Yahweh said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “My wrath is kindled against you, and against your two friends; for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has. <sup>8</sup>Now therefore, take to yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept him, that I not deal with you according to your folly. For you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.”</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did what Yahweh commanded them, and Yahweh accepted Job.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    Yahweh restored Job’s prosperity when he prayed for his friends. Yahweh gave Job twice as much as he had before. <sup>11</sup>Then all his brothers, all his sisters, and all those who had been of his acquaintance before, came to him and ate bread with him in his house. They comforted him, and consoled him concerning all the evil that Yahweh had brought on him. Everyone also gave him a piece of money,<sup><a href="#footnote-17" id="ref-17">†</a></sup> and everyone a ring of gold.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    So Yahweh blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand female donkeys. <sup>13</sup>He had also seven sons and three daughters. <sup>14</sup>He called the name of the first, Jemimah; and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren Happuch. <sup>15</sup>In all the land were no women found so beautiful as the daughters of Job. Their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers. <sup>16</sup>After this Job lived one hundred forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, to four generations. <sup>17</sup>So Job died, being old and full of days.</p><a href="#Job-h">^</a> <a href="#Job-c-1">[1]</a> <a href="#Job-c-2">[2]</a> <a href="#Job-c-3">[3]</a> <a href="#Job-c-4">[4]</a> <a href="#Job-c-5">[5]</a> <a href="#Job-c-6">[6]</a> <a href="#Job-c-7">[7]</a> <a href="#Job-c-8">[8]</a> <a href="#Job-c-9">[9]</a> <a href="#Job-c-10">[10]</a> <a href="#Job-c-11">[11]</a> <a href="#Job-c-12">[12]</a> <a href="#Job-c-13">[13]</a> <a href="#Job-c-14">[14]</a> <a href="#Job-c-15">[15]</a> <a href="#Job-c-16">[16]</a> <a href="#Job-c-17">[17]</a> <a href="#Job-c-18">[18]</a> <a href="#Job-c-19">[19]</a> <a href="#Job-c-20">[20]</a> <a href="#Job-c-21">[21]</a> <a href="#Job-c-22">[22]</a> <a href="#Job-c-23">[23]</a> <a href="#Job-c-24">[24]</a> <a href="#Job-c-25">[25]</a> <a href="#Job-c-26">[26]</a> <a href="#Job-c-27">[27]</a> <a href="#Job-c-28">[28]</a> <a href="#Job-c-29">[29]</a> <a href="#Job-c-30">[30]</a> <a href="#Job-c-31">[31]</a> <a href="#Job-c-32">[32]</a> <a href="#Job-c-33">[33]</a> <a href="#Job-c-34">[34]</a> <a href="#Job-c-35">[35]</a> <a href="#Job-c-36">[36]</a> <a href="#Job-c-37">[37]</a> <a href="#Job-c-38">[38]</a> <a href="#Job-c-39">[39]</a> <a href="#Job-c-40">[40]</a> <a href="#Job-c-41">[41]</a> <a href="#Job-c-42">[42]</a>
