    Paul, a prisoner of Christ<sup><a href="#footnote-0" id="ref-0">†</a></sup> Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker, <sup>2</sup>to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house: <sup>3</sup>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers, <sup>5</sup>hearing of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints, <sup>6</sup>that the fellowship of your faith may become effective in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us in Christ Jesus. <sup>7</sup>For we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    Therefore though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate, <sup>9</sup>yet for love’s sake I rather appeal to you, being such a one as Paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of Jesus Christ. <sup>10</sup>I appeal to you for my child Onesimus, whom I have become the father of in my chains,<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="ref-1">†</a></sup> <sup>11</sup>who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and to me. <sup>12</sup>I am sending him back. Therefore receive him, that is, my own heart, <sup>13</sup>whom I desired to keep with me, that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News. <sup>14</sup>But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will. <sup>15</sup>For perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while that you would have him forever, <sup>16</sup>no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother—especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me. <sup>18</sup>But if he has wronged you at all or owes you anything, put that to my account. <sup>19</sup>I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides). <sup>20</sup>Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you, <sup>24</sup>as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</p><a href="#Philemon-h">^</a> <a href="#Philemon-c-1">[1]</a>
