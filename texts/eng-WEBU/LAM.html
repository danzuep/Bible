    <sup>1</sup>How the city sits solitary,</p><p>
    that was full of people!</p><p>
    She has become as a widow,</p><p>
    who was great among the nations!</p><p>
    She who was a princess among the provinces</p><p>
    has become a slave!</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    She weeps bitterly in the night.</p><p>
    Her tears are on her cheeks.</p><p>
    Among all her lovers</p><p>
    she has no one to comfort her.</p><p>
    All her friends have dealt treacherously with her.</p><p>
    They have become her enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    Judah has gone into captivity because of affliction</p><p>
    and because of great servitude.</p><p>
    She dwells among the nations.</p><p>
    She finds no rest.</p><p>
    All her persecutors overtook her in her distress.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    The roads to Zion mourn,</p><p>
    because no one comes to the solemn assembly.</p><p>
    All her gates are desolate.</p><p>
    Her priests sigh.</p><p>
    Her virgins are afflicted,</p><p>
    and she herself is in bitterness.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Her adversaries have become the head.</p><p>
    Her enemies prosper;</p><p>
    for Yahweh<sup><a href="#footnote-0" id="ref-0">†</a></sup> has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions.</p><p>
    Her young children have gone into captivity before the adversary.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    All majesty has departed from the daughter of Zion.</p><p>
    Her princes have become like deer that find no pasture.</p><p>
    They have gone without strength before the pursuer.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    Jerusalem remembers in the days of her affliction and of her miseries</p><p>
    all her pleasant things that were from the days of old;</p><p>
    when her people fell into the hand of the adversary,</p><p>
    and no one helped her.</p><p>
    The adversaries saw her.</p><p>
    They mocked at her desolations.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    Jerusalem has grievously sinned.</p><p>
    Therefore she has become unclean.</p><p>
    All who honored her despise her,</p><p>
    because they have seen her nakedness.</p><p>
    Yes, she sighs and turns backward.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    Her filthiness was in her skirts.</p><p>
    She didn’t remember her latter end.</p><p>
    Therefore she has come down astoundingly.</p><p>
    She has no comforter.</p><p>“See, Yahweh, my affliction;</p><p>
    for the enemy has magnified himself.”</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    The adversary has spread out his hand on all her pleasant things;</p><p>
    for she has seen that the nations have entered into her sanctuary,</p><p>
    concerning whom you commanded that they should not enter into your assembly.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    All her people sigh.</p><p>
    They seek bread.</p><p>
    They have given their pleasant things for food to refresh their soul.</p><p>“Look, Yahweh, and see,</p><p>
    for I have become despised.”</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>“Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by?</p><p>
    Look, and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow,</p><p>
    which is brought on me,</p><p>
    with which Yahweh has afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>“From on high has he sent fire into my bones,</p><p>
    and it prevails against them.</p><p>
    He has spread a net for my feet.</p><p>
    He has turned me back.</p><p>
    He has made me desolate and I faint all day long.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>“The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand.</p><p>
    They are knit together.</p><p>
    They have come up on my neck.</p><p>
    He made my strength fail.</p><p>
    The Lord<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="ref-1">†</a></sup> has delivered me into their hands,</p><p>
    against whom I am not able to stand.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>“The Lord has set at nothing all my mighty men within me.</p><p>
    He has called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young men.</p><p>
    The Lord has trodden the virgin daughter of Judah as in a wine press.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>“For these things I weep.</p><p>
    My eye, my eye runs down with water,</p><p>
    because the comforter who should refresh my soul is far from me.</p><p>
    My children are desolate,</p><p>
    because the enemy has prevailed.”</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    Zion spreads out her hands.</p><p>
    There is no one to comfort her.</p><p>
    Yahweh has commanded concerning Jacob,</p><p>
    that those who are around him should be his adversaries.</p><p>
    Jerusalem is among them as an unclean thing.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>“Yahweh is righteous,</p><p>
    for I have rebelled against his commandment.</p><p>
    Please hear all you peoples,</p><p>
    and see my sorrow.</p><p>
    My virgins and my young men have gone into captivity.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>“I called for my lovers,</p><p>
    but they deceived me.</p><p>
    My priests and my elders gave up the spirit in the city,</p><p>
    while they sought food for themselves to refresh their souls.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>“Look, Yahweh; for I am in distress.</p><p>
    My heart is troubled.</p><p>
    My heart turns over within me,</p><p>
    for I have grievously rebelled.</p><p>
    Abroad, the sword bereaves.</p><p>
    At home, it is like death.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>“They have heard that I sigh.</p><p>
    There is no one to comfort me.</p><p>
    All my enemies have heard of my trouble.</p><p>
    They are glad that you have done it.</p><p>
    You will bring the day that you have proclaimed,</p><p>
    and they will be like me.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>“Let all their wickedness come before you.</p><p>
    Do to them as you have done to me for all my transgressions.</p><p>
    For my sighs are many,</p><p>
    and my heart is faint.</p><a href="#Lamentations-c-2"><h3 id="Lamentations-c-2">2</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    How has the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger!</p><p>
    He has cast the beauty of Israel down from heaven to the earth,</p><p>
    and hasn’t remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    The Lord has swallowed up all the dwellings of Jacob</p><p>
    without pity.</p><p>
    He has thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah.</p><p>
    He has brought them down to the ground.</p><p>
    He has profaned the kingdom and its princes.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    He has cut off all the horn of Israel in fierce anger.</p><p>
    He has drawn back his right hand from before the enemy.</p><p>
    He has burned up Jacob like a flaming fire,</p><p>
    which devours all around.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    He has bent his bow like an enemy.</p><p>
    He has stood with his right hand as an adversary.</p><p>
    He has killed all that were pleasant to the eye.</p><p>
    In the tent of the daughter of Zion, he has poured out his wrath like fire.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    The Lord has become as an enemy.</p><p>
    He has swallowed up Israel.</p><p>
    He has swallowed up all her palaces.</p><p>
    He has destroyed his strongholds.</p><p>
    He has multiplied mourning and lamentation in the daughter of Judah.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    He has violently taken away his tabernacle,</p><p>
    as if it were a garden.</p><p>
    He has destroyed his place of assembly.</p><p>
    Yahweh has caused solemn assembly and Sabbath to be forgotten in Zion.</p><p>
    In the indignation of his anger, he has despised the king and the priest.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    The Lord has cast off his altar.</p><p>
    He has abhorred his sanctuary.</p><p>
    He has given the walls of her palaces into the hand of the enemy.</p><p>
    They have made a noise in Yahweh’s house,</p><p>
    as in the day of a solemn assembly.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    Yahweh has purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion.</p><p>
    He has stretched out the line.</p><p>
    He has not withdrawn his hand from destroying;</p><p>
    He has made the rampart and wall lament.</p><p>
    They languish together.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    Her gates have sunk into the ground.</p><p>
    He has destroyed and broken her bars.</p><p>
    Her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is not.</p><p>
    Yes, her prophets find no vision from Yahweh.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    The elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground.</p><p>
    They keep silence.</p><p>
    They have cast up dust on their heads.</p><p>
    They have clothed themselves with sackcloth.</p><p>
    The virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    My eyes fail with tears.</p><p>
    My heart is troubled.</p><p>
    My bile is poured on the earth,</p><p>
    because of the destruction of the daughter of my people,</p><p>
    because the young children and the infants swoon in the streets of the city.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    They ask their mothers,</p><p>“Where is grain and wine?”</p><p>when they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city,</p><p>when their soul is poured out into their mothers’ bosom.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    What shall I testify to you?</p><p>
    What shall I liken to you, daughter of Jerusalem?</p><p>
    What shall I compare to you,</p><p>
    that I may comfort you, virgin daughter of Zion?</p><p>
    For your breach is as big as the sea.</p><p>
    Who can heal you?</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    Your prophets have seen false and foolish visions for you.</p><p>
    They have not uncovered your iniquity,</p><p>
    to reverse your captivity,</p><p>
    but have seen for you false revelations and causes of banishment.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    All that pass by clap their hands at you.</p><p>
    They hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying,</p><p>“Is this the city that men called ‘The perfection of beauty,</p><p>
    the joy of the whole earth’?”</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    All your enemies have opened their mouth wide against you.</p><p>
    They hiss and gnash their teeth.</p><p>
    They say, “We have swallowed her up.</p><p>
    Certainly this is the day that we looked for.</p><p>
    We have found it.</p><p>
    We have seen it.”</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    Yahweh has done that which he planned.</p><p>
    He has fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old.</p><p>
    He has thrown down,</p><p>
    and has not pitied.</p><p>
    He has caused the enemy to rejoice over you.</p><p>
    He has exalted the horn of your adversaries.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    Their heart cried to the Lord.</p><p>
    O wall of the daughter of Zion,</p><p>
    let tears run down like a river day and night.</p><p>
    Give yourself no relief.</p><p>Don’t let your eyes rest.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    Arise, cry out in the night,</p><p>
    at the beginning of the watches!</p><p>
    Pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord.</p><p>
    Lift up your hands toward him for the life of your young children,</p><p>
    who faint for hunger at the head of every street.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>“Look, Yahweh, and see to whom you have done thus!</p><p>
    Should the women eat their offspring,</p><p>
    the children that they held and bounced on their knees?</p><p>
    Should the priest and the prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord?</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>“The youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets.</p><p>
    My virgins and my young men have fallen by the sword.</p><p>
    You have killed them in the day of your anger.</p><p>
    You have slaughtered, and not pitied.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>“You have called, as in the day of a solemn assembly, my terrors on every side.</p><p>
    There was no one that escaped or remained in the day of Yahweh’s anger.</p><p>
    My enemy has consumed those whom I have cared for and brought up.</p><a href="#Lamentations-c-3"><h3 id="Lamentations-c-3">3</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    I am the man who has seen affliction</p><p>
    by the rod of his wrath.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    He has led me and caused me to walk in darkness,</p><p>
    and not in light.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    Surely he turns his hand against me</p><p>
    again and again all day long.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    He has made my flesh and my skin old.</p><p>
    He has broken my bones.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    He has built against me,</p><p>
    and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    He has made me dwell in dark places,</p><p>
    as those who have been long dead.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    He has walled me about, so that I can’t go out.</p><p>
    He has made my chain heavy.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    Yes, when I cry, and call for help,</p><p>
    he shuts out my prayer.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>He has walled up my ways with cut stone.</p><p>He has made my paths crooked.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    He is to me as a bear lying in wait,</p><p>
    as a lion in hiding.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    He has turned away my path,</p><p>
    and pulled me in pieces.</p><p>
    He has made me desolate.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>He has bent his bow,</p><p>
    and set me as a mark for the arrow.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    He has caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my kidneys.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    I have become a derision to all my people,</p><p>
    and their song all day long.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>He has filled me with bitterness.</p><p>He has stuffed me with wormwood.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>He has also broken my teeth with gravel.</p><p>He has covered me with ashes.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    You have removed my soul far away from peace.</p><p>
    I forgot prosperity.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    I said, “My strength has perished,</p><p>along with my expectation from Yahweh.”</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    Remember my affliction and my misery,</p><p>
    the wormwood and the bitterness.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    My soul still remembers them,</p><p>
    and is bowed down within me.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    This I recall to my mind;</p><p>
    therefore I have hope.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    It is because of Yahweh’s loving kindnesses that we are not consumed,</p><p>
    because his mercies don’t fail.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    They are new every morning.</p><p>
    Great is your faithfulness.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>“Yahweh is my portion,” says my soul.</p><p>“Therefore I will hope in him.”</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    Yahweh is good to those who wait for him,</p><p>
    to the soul who seeks him.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    It is good that a man should hope</p><p>
    and quietly wait for the salvation of Yahweh.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>
    It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>Let him sit alone and keep silence,</p><p>
    because he has laid it on him.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>
    Let him put his mouth in the dust,</p><p>
    if it is so that there may be hope.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>
    Let him give his cheek to him who strikes him.</p><p>
    Let him be filled full of reproach.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>
    For the Lord will not cast off forever.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>
    For though he causes grief,</p><p>
    yet he will have compassion according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>
    For he does not afflict willingly,</p><p>
    nor grieve the children of men.</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>
    To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth,</p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>
    to turn away the right of a man before the face of the Most High,</p><p>
    <sup>36</sup>
    to subvert a man in his cause, the Lord doesn’t approve.</p><p>
    <sup>37</sup>
    Who is he who says, and it comes to pass,</p><p>
    when the Lord doesn’t command it?</p><p>
    <sup>38</sup>Doesn’t evil and good come out of the mouth of the Most High?</p><p>
    <sup>39</sup>
    Why should a living man complain,</p><p>
    a man for the punishment of his sins?</p><p>
    <sup>40</sup>
    Let us search and try our ways,</p><p>
    and turn again to Yahweh.</p><p>

    My eye runs down with streams of water,</p><p>

    You came near in the day that I called on you.</p><p>

    The most pure gold has changed!</p><p>
    The stones of the sanctuary are poured out</p><p>
    at the head of every street.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    The precious sons of Zion,</p><p>
    comparable to fine gold,</p><p>
    how they are esteemed as earthen pitchers,</p><p>
    the work of the hands of the potter!</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    Even the jackals offer their breast.</p><p>
    They nurse their young ones.</p><p>
    But the daughter of my people has become cruel,</p><p>
    like the ostriches in the wilderness.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    The tongue of the nursing child clings to the roof of his mouth for thirst.</p><p>
    The young children ask for bread,</p><p>
    and no one breaks it for them.</p><p>

    Those who ate delicacies are desolate in the streets.</p><p>
    Those who were brought up in purple embrace dunghills.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom,</p><p>
    which was overthrown as in a moment.</p><p>
    No hands were laid on her.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Her nobles were purer than snow.</p><p>They were whiter than milk.</p><p>They were more ruddy in body than rubies.</p><p>Their polishing was like sapphire.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    Their appearance is blacker than a coal.</p><p>
    They are not known in the streets.</p><p>
    Their skin clings to their bones.</p><p>
    It is withered.</p><p>
    It has become like wood.</p><p>

    Those who are killed with the sword are better than those who are killed with hunger;</p><p>

    for lack of the fruits of the field.</p><p>

    The hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children.</p><p>
    They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.</p><p>

    Yahweh has accomplished his wrath.</p><p>

    that have shed the blood of the just in the middle of her.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    They wander as blind men in the streets.</p><p>
    They are polluted with blood,</p><p>
    So that men can’t touch their garments.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>“Go away!” they cried to them.</p><p>“Unclean! Go away! Go away! Don’t touch!</p><p>
    When they fled away and wandered, men said among the nations,</p><p>“They can’t live here any more.”</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    Yahweh’s anger has scattered them.</p><p>
    He will not pay attention to them any more.</p><p>
    They didn’t respect the persons of the priests.</p><p>
    They didn’t favor the elders.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    Our eyes still fail,</p><p>looking in vain for our help.</p><p>
    In our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    They hunt our steps,</p><p>
    so that we can’t go in our streets.</p><p>
    Our end is near.</p><p>
    Our days are fulfilled,</p><p>
    for our end has come.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the sky.</p><p>
    They chased us on the mountains.</p><p>
    They set an ambush for us in the wilderness.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    The breath of our nostrils,</p><p>
    the anointed of Yahweh,</p><p>
    was taken in their pits;</p><p>
    of whom we said,</p><p>under his shadow we will live among the nations.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    Rejoice and be glad, daughter of Edom,</p><p>
    who dwells in the land of Uz.</p><p>
    The cup will pass through to you also.</p><p>
    You will be drunken,</p><p>
    and will make yourself naked.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    The punishment of your iniquity is accomplished, daughter of Zion.</p><p>
    He will no more carry you away into captivity.</p><p>
    He will visit your iniquity, daughter of Edom.</p><p>
    He will uncover your sins.</p><a href="#Lamentations-c-5"><h3 id="Lamentations-c-5">5</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Remember, Yahweh, what has come on us.</p><p>
    Look, and see our reproach.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers,</p><p>our houses to aliens.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>We are orphans and fatherless.</p><p>
    Our mothers are as widows.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>We must pay for water to drink.</p><p>
    Our wood is sold to us.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Our pursuers are on our necks.</p><p>We are weary, and have no rest.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>We have given our hands to the Egyptians,</p><p>
    and to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    Our fathers sinned, and are no more.</p><p>We have borne their iniquities.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    Servants rule over us.</p><p>There is no one to deliver us out of their hand.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    We get our bread at the peril of our lives,</p><p>
    because of the sword in the wilderness.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    Our skin is black like an oven,</p><p>
    because of the burning heat of famine.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    They ravished the women in Zion,</p><p>
    the virgins in the cities of Judah.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    Princes were hanged up by their hands.</p><p>
    The faces of elders were not honored.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    The young men carry millstones.</p><p>
    The children stumbled under loads of wood.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    The elders have ceased from the gate,</p><p>
    and the young men from their music.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    The joy of our heart has ceased.</p><p>
    Our dance is turned into mourning.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    The crown has fallen from our head.</p><p>Woe to us, for we have sinned!</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    For this our heart is faint.</p><p>
    For these things our eyes are dim:</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    for the mountain of Zion, which is desolate.</p><p>
    The foxes walk on it.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    You, Yahweh, remain forever.</p><p>
    Your throne is from generation to generation.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    Why do you forget us forever,</p><p>
    and forsake us for so long a time?</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    Turn us to yourself, Yahweh, and we will be turned.</p><p>
    Renew our days as of old.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    But you have utterly rejected us.</p><p>
    You are very angry against us.</p><a href="#Lamentations-h">^</a> <a href="#Lamentations-c-1">[1]</a> <a href="#Lamentations-c-2">[2]</a> <a href="#Lamentations-c-3">[3]</a> <a href="#Lamentations-c-4">[4]</a> <a href="#Lamentations-c-5">[5]</a>
