<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Yahweh’s<sup><a href="#footnote-0" id="ref-0">†</a></sup> word that came to Joel, the son of Pethuel.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    Hear this, you elders,</p><p>
    and listen, all you inhabitants of the land!</p><p>
    Has this ever happened in your days,</p><p>
    or in the days of your fathers?</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    Tell your children about it,</p><p>
    and have your children tell their children,</p><p>
    and their children, another generation.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    What the swarming locust has left, the great locust has eaten.</p><p>
    What the great locust has left, the grasshopper has eaten.</p><p>
    What the grasshopper has left, the caterpillar has eaten.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Wake up, you drunkards, and weep!</p><p>
    Wail, all you drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine,</p><p>
    for it is cut off from your mouth.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    For a nation has come up on my land, strong, and without number.</p><p>
    His teeth are the teeth of a lion,</p><p>
    and he has the fangs of a lioness.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    He has laid my vine waste,</p><p>
    and stripped my fig tree.</p><p>
    He has stripped its bark, and thrown it away.</p><p>
    Its branches are made white.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    Mourn like a virgin dressed in sackcloth</p><p>
    for the husband of her youth!</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    The meal offering and the drink offering are cut off from Yahweh’s house.</p><p>
    The priests, Yahweh’s ministers, mourn.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    The field is laid waste.</p><p>
    The land mourns, for the grain is destroyed,</p><p>
    The new wine has dried up,</p><p>
    and the oil languishes.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    Be confounded, you farmers!</p><p>
    Wail, you vineyard keepers,</p><p>
    for the wheat and for the barley;</p><p>
    for the harvest of the field has perished.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    The vine has dried up, and the fig tree withered—</p><p>
    the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree,</p><p>
    even all of the trees of the field are withered;</p><p>
    for joy has withered away from the sons of men.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    Put on sackcloth and mourn, you priests!</p><p>
    Wail, you ministers of the altar.</p><p>
    Come, lie all night in sackcloth, you ministers of my God,<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="ref-1">†</a></sup></p><p>
    for the meal offering and the drink offering are withheld from your God’s house.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    Sanctify a fast.</p><p>
    Call a solemn assembly.</p><p>Gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land to the house of Yahweh, your God,</p><p>
    and cry to Yahweh.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>Alas for the day!</p><p>
    For the day of Yahweh is at hand,</p><p>
    and it will come as destruction from the Almighty.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>Isn’t the food cut off before our eyes,</p><p>
    joy and gladness from the house of our God?</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    The seeds rot under their clods.</p><p>
    The granaries are laid desolate.</p><p>
    The barns are broken down, for the grain has withered.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    How the animals groan!</p><p>
    The herds of livestock are perplexed, because they have no pasture.</p><p>
    Yes, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    Yahweh, I cry to you,</p><p>
    for the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness,</p><p>
    and the flame has burned all the trees of the field.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    Yes, the animals of the field pant to you,</p><p>
    for the water brooks have dried up,</p><p>
    and the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.</p><a href="#Joel-c-2"><h3 id="Joel-c-2">2</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Blow the trumpet in Zion,</p><p>
    and sound an alarm in my holy mountain!</p><p>Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble,</p><p>
    for the day of Yahweh comes,</p><p>
    for it is close at hand:</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    A day of darkness and gloominess,</p><p>
    a day of clouds and thick darkness.</p><p>
    As the dawn spreading on the mountains,</p><p>
    a great and strong people;</p><p>
    there has never been the like,</p><p>
    neither will there be any more after them,</p><p>
    even to the years of many generations.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    A fire devours before them,</p><p>
    and behind them, a flame burns.</p><p>
    The land is as the garden of Eden before them,</p><p>
    and behind them, a desolate wilderness.</p><p>
    Yes, and no one has escaped them.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    Their appearance is as the appearance of horses,</p><p>
    and they run as horsemen.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains, they leap,</p><p>
    like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble,</p><p>
    like a strong people set in battle array.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    At their presence the peoples are in anguish.</p><p>
    All faces have grown pale.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    They run like mighty men.</p><p>
    They climb the wall like warriors.</p><p>
    They each march in his line, and they don’t swerve off course.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    One doesn’t jostle another.</p><p>
    They each march in their own path.</p><p>
    They burst through the defenses</p><p>
    and don’t break ranks.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    They rush on the city.</p><p>
    They run on the wall.</p><p>
    They climb up into the houses.</p><p>
    They enter in at the windows like thieves.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    The earth quakes before them.</p><p>
    The heavens tremble.</p><p>
    The sun and the moon are darkened,</p><p>
    and the stars withdraw their shining.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    Yahweh thunders his voice before his army,</p><p>
    for his forces are very great;</p><p>
    for he is strong who obeys his command;</p><p>
    for the day of Yahweh is great and very awesome,</p><p>
    and who can endure it?</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>“Yet even now,” says Yahweh, “turn to me with all your heart,</p><p>
    and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning.”</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    Tear your heart and not your garments,</p><p>
    and turn to Yahweh, your God;</p><p>
    for he is gracious and merciful,</p><p>slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness,</p><p>
    and relents from sending calamity.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    Who knows? He may turn and relent,</p><p>
    and leave a blessing behind him,</p><p>
    even a meal offering and a drink offering to Yahweh, your God.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    Blow the trumpet in Zion!</p><p>
    Sanctify a fast.</p><p>
    Call a solemn assembly.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    Gather the people.</p><p>
    Sanctify the assembly.</p><p>
    Assemble the elders.</p><p>
    Gather the children, and those who nurse from breasts.</p><p>Let the bridegroom go out of his room,</p><p>
    and the bride out of her chamber.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    Let the priests, the ministers of Yahweh, weep between the porch and the altar,</p><p>
    and let them say, “Spare your people, Yahweh,</p><p>
    and don’t give your heritage to reproach,</p><p>
    that the nations should rule over them.</p><p>
    Why should they say among the peoples,</p><p>‘Where is their God?’”</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    Then Yahweh was jealous for his land,</p><p>
    and had pity on his people.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    Yahweh answered his people,</p><p>“Behold,<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="ref-2">†</a></sup> I will send you grain, new wine, and oil,</p><p>
    and you will be satisfied with them;</p><p>
    and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    But I will remove the northern army far away from you,</p><p>
    and will drive it into a barren and desolate land,</p><p>
    its front into the eastern sea,</p><p>
    and its back into the western sea;</p><p>
    and its stench will come up,</p><p>
    and its bad smell will rise.”</p><p>
    Surely he has done great things.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>Land, don’t be afraid.</p><p>
    Be glad and rejoice, for Yahweh has done great things.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>Don’t be afraid, you animals of the field;</p><p>
    for the pastures of the wilderness spring up,</p><p>
    for the tree bears its fruit.</p><p>
    The fig tree and the vine yield their strength.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>“Be glad then, you children of Zion,</p><p>
    and rejoice in Yahweh, your God;</p><p>
    for he gives you the early rain in just measure,</p><p>
    and he causes the rain to come down for you,</p><p>
    the early rain and the latter rain, as before.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    The threshing floors will be full of wheat,</p><p>
    and the vats will overflow with new wine and oil.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten,</p><p>
    the great locust, the grasshopper, and the caterpillar,</p><p>
    my great army, which I sent among you.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    You will have plenty to eat and be satisfied,</p><p>
    and will praise the name of Yahweh, your God,</p><p>
    who has dealt wondrously with you;</p><p>
    and my people will never again be disappointed.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>
    You will know that I am among Israel,</p><p>
    and that I am Yahweh, your God, and there is no one else;</p><p>
    and my people will never again be disappointed.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>“It will happen afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh;</p><p>and your sons and your daughters will prophesy.</p><p>Your old men will dream dreams.</p><p>Your young men will see visions.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>And also on the servants and on the handmaids in those days,</p><p>I will pour out my Spirit.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth:</p><p>blood, fire, and pillars of smoke.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>The sun will be turned into darkness,</p><p>and the moon into blood,</p><p>before the great and terrible day of Yahweh comes.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>It will happen that whoever will call on Yahweh’s name shall be saved;</p><p>for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape,</p><p>as Yahweh has said,</p><p>and among the remnant, those whom Yahweh calls.</p><a href="#Joel-c-3"><h3 id="Joel-c-3">3</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>“For, behold, in those days,</p><p>
    and in that time,</p><p>
    when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    I will gather all nations,</p><p>
    and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat;</p><p>
    and I will execute judgment on them there for my people,</p><p>
    and for my heritage, Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations.</p><p>
    They have divided my land,</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    and have cast lots for my people,</p><p>
    and have given a boy for a prostitute,</p><p>
    and sold a girl for wine, that they may drink.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>“Yes, and what are you to me, Tyre and Sidon,</p><p>
    and all the regions of Philistia?</p><p>
    Will you repay me?</p><p>
    And if you repay me,</p><p>
    I will swiftly and speedily return your repayment on your own head.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Because you have taken my silver and my gold,</p><p>
    and have carried my finest treasures into your temples,</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>and have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem to the sons of the Greeks,</p><p>that you may remove them far from their border.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Behold, I will stir them up out of the place where you have sold them,</p><p>and will return your repayment on your own head;</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hands of the children of Judah,</p><p>and they will sell them to the men of Sheba,</p><p>to a faraway nation,</p><p>for Yahweh has spoken it.”</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Proclaim this among the nations:</p><p>“Prepare for war!</p><p>Stir up the mighty men.</p><p>Let all the warriors draw near.</p><p>Let them come up. <sup>10</sup>Beat your plowshares into swords,</p><p>and your pruning hooks into spears.</p><p>Let the weak say, ‘I am strong.’</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Hurry and come, all you surrounding nations,</p><p>and gather yourselves together.”</p><p>Cause your mighty ones to come down there, Yahweh.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>“Let the nations arouse themselves,</p><p>and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat;</p><p>for there I will sit to judge all the surrounding nations.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Put in the sickle;</p><p>for the harvest is ripe.</p><p>Come, tread, for the wine press is full,</p><p>the vats overflow, for their wickedness is great.”</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision!</p><p>For the day of Yahweh is near in the valley of decision.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>The sun and the moon are darkened,</p><p>and the stars withdraw their shining.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    Yahweh will roar from Zion,</p><p>and thunder from Jerusalem;</p><p>and the heavens and the earth will shake;</p><p>but Yahweh will be a refuge to his people,</p><p>and a stronghold to the children of Israel.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>“So you will know that I am Yahweh, your God,</p><p>dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain.</p><p>Then Jerusalem will be holy,</p><p>and no strangers will pass through her any more.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>It will happen in that day,</p><p>that the mountains will drop down sweet wine,</p><p>the hills will flow with milk,</p><p>all the brooks of Judah will flow with waters;</p><p>and a fountain will flow out from Yahweh’s house,</p><p>and will water the valley of Shittim.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Egypt will be a desolation</p><p>and Edom will be a desolate wilderness,</p><p>for the violence done to the children of Judah,</p><p>because they have shed innocent blood in their land.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>But Judah will be inhabited forever,</p><p>and Jerusalem from generation to generation.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>I will cleanse their blood</p><p>that I have not cleansed,</p><p>for Yahweh dwells in Zion.”</p><a href="#Joel-h">^</a> <a href="#Joel-c-1">[1]</a> <a href="#Joel-c-2">[2]</a> <a href="#Joel-c-3">[3]</a>
