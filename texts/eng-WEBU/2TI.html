<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ<sup><a href="#footnote-0" id="ref-0">†</a></sup> through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus, <sup>2</sup>to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience. How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day <sup>4</sup>longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy; <sup>5</sup>having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you, which lived first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, in you also.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands. <sup>7</sup>For God didn’t give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control. <sup>8</sup>Therefore don’t be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God, <sup>9</sup>who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal, <sup>10</sup>but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Good News. <sup>11</sup>For this I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. <sup>12</sup>For this cause I also suffer these things.</p><p>
    Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. <sup>14</sup>That good thing which was committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me, of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes. <sup>16</sup>May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain, <sup>17</sup>but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently and found me <sup>18</sup>(the Lord grant to him to find the Lord’s mercy in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well.</p><a href="#2 Timothy-c-2"><h3 id="2 Timothy-c-2">2</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. <sup>2</sup>The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same things to faithful men who will be able to teach others also. <sup>3</sup>You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. <sup>4</sup>No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier. <sup>5</sup>Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he isn’t crowned unless he has competed by the rules. <sup>6</sup>The farmer who labors must be the first to get a share of the crops. <sup>7</sup>Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the offspring<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="ref-1">†</a></sup> of David, according to my Good News, <sup>9</sup>in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal. But God’s word isn’t chained. <sup>10</sup>Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones’ sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. <sup>11</sup>This saying is trustworthy:</p><p>“For if we died with him,</p><p>
    we will also live with him.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    If we endure,</p><p>
    we will also reign with him.</p><p>
    If we deny him,</p><p>
    he also will deny us.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    If we are faithless,</p><p>
    he remains faithful;</p><p>
    for he can’t deny himself.”</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord that they don’t argue about words to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn’t need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth. <sup>16</sup>But shun empty chatter, for it will go further in ungodliness, <sup>17</sup>and those words will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus: <sup>18</sup>men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some. <sup>19</sup>However, God’s firm foundation stands, having this seal: “The Lord knows those who are his,”<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="ref-2">†</a></sup> and, “Let every one who names the name of the Lord<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="ref-3">†</a></sup> depart from unrighteousness.”</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some are for honor and some for dishonor. <sup>21</sup>If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master’s use, prepared for every good work.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. <sup>23</sup>But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife. <sup>24</sup>The Lord’s servant must not quarrel, but be gentle toward all, able to teach, patient, <sup>25</sup>in gentleness correcting those who oppose him. Perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth, <sup>26</sup>and they may recover themselves out of the devil’s snare, having been taken captive by him to do his will.</p><a href="#2 Timothy-c-3"><h3 id="2 Timothy-c-3">3</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    But know this: that in the last days, grievous times will come. <sup>2</sup>For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, <sup>3</sup>without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, not lovers of good, <sup>4</sup>traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, <sup>5</sup>holding a form of godliness but having denied its power. Turn away from these, also. <sup>6</sup>For some of these are people who creep into houses and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts, <sup>7</sup>always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. <sup>8</sup>Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind, who concerning the faith are rejected. <sup>9</sup>But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    But you followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness, <sup>11</sup>persecutions, and sufferings—those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those persecutions. The Lord delivered me out of them all. <sup>12</sup>Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. <sup>13</sup>But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. <sup>14</sup>But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them. <sup>15</sup>From infancy, you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. <sup>16</sup>Every Scripture is God-breathed and<sup><a href="#footnote-4" id="ref-4">†</a></sup> profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness, <sup>17</sup>that each person who belongs to God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.</p><a href="#2 Timothy-c-4"><h3 id="2 Timothy-c-4">4</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    I command you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom: <sup>2</sup>preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort with all patience and teaching. <sup>3</sup>For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts, <sup>4</sup>and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn away to fables. <sup>5</sup>But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come. <sup>7</sup>I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith. <sup>8</sup>From now on, the crown of righteousness is stored up for me, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Be diligent to come to me soon, <sup>10</sup>for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia; and Titus to Dalmatia. <sup>11</sup>Only Luke is with me. Take Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service. <sup>12</sup>But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus. <sup>13</sup>Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come—and the books, especially the parchments. <sup>14</sup>Alexander the coppersmith did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his deeds. <sup>15</sup>Beware of him, for he greatly opposed our words.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them. <sup>17</sup>But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear. So I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. <sup>18</sup>And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus. <sup>20</sup>Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick. <sup>21</sup>Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.</p><a href="#2 Timothy-h">^</a> <a href="#2 Timothy-c-1">[1]</a> <a href="#2 Timothy-c-2">[2]</a> <a href="#2 Timothy-c-3">[3]</a> <a href="#2 Timothy-c-4">[4]</a>
