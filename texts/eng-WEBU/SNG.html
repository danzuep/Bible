<a href="#Song of Solomon-c-1"><h3 id="Song of Solomon-c-1">1</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    The Song of songs, which is Solomon’s.</p><p>Beloved</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth;</p><p>
    for your love is better than wine.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    Your oils have a pleasing fragrance.</p><p>
    Your name is oil poured out,</p><p>
    therefore the virgins love you.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    Take me away with you.</p><p>
    Let’s hurry.</p><p>
    The king has brought me into his rooms.</p><p>Friends</p><p>We will be glad and rejoice in you.</p><p>We will praise your love more than wine!</p><p>Beloved</p><p>
    They are right to love you.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>I am dark, but lovely,</p><p>you daughters of Jerusalem,</p><p>
    like Kedar’s tents,</p><p>
    like Solomon’s curtains.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Don’t stare at me because I am dark,</p><p>because the sun has scorched me.</p><p>
    My mother’s sons were angry with me.</p><p>
    They made me keeper of the vineyards.</p><p>
    I haven’t kept my own vineyard.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    Tell me, you whom my soul loves,</p><p>
    where you graze your flock,</p><p>
    where you rest them at noon;</p><p>
    for why should I be as one who is veiled</p><p>
    beside the flocks of your companions?</p><p>Lover</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>If you don’t know, most beautiful among women,</p><p>follow the tracks of the sheep.</p><p>
    Graze your young goats beside the shepherds’ tents.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    I have compared you, my love,</p><p>
    to a steed in Pharaoh’s chariots.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    Your cheeks are beautiful with earrings,</p><p>
    your neck with strings of jewels.</p><p>Friends</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    We will make you earrings of gold,</p><p>
    with studs of silver.</p><p>Beloved</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    While the king sat at his table,</p><p>
    my perfume spread its fragrance.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh,</p><p>
    that lies between my breasts.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms</p><p>
    from the vineyards of En Gedi.</p><p>Lover</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    Behold,<sup><a href="#footnote-0" id="ref-0">†</a></sup> you are beautiful, my love.</p><p>
    Behold, you are beautiful.</p><p>
    Your eyes are like doves.</p><p>Beloved</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    Behold, you are beautiful, my beloved, yes, pleasant;</p><p>
    and our couch is verdant.</p><p>Lover</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    The beams of our house are cedars.</p><p>Our rafters are firs.</p><a href="#Song of Solomon-c-2"><h3 id="Song of Solomon-c-2">2</h3></a>
<p>Beloved</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>I am a rose of Sharon,</p><p>
    a lily of the valleys.</p><p>Lover</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    As a lily among thorns,</p><p>
    so is my love among the daughters.</p><p>Beloved</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    As the apple tree among the trees of the wood,</p><p>
    so is my beloved among the sons.</p><p>
    I sat down under his shadow with great delight,</p><p>
    his fruit was sweet to my taste.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    He brought me to the banquet hall.</p><p>
    His banner over me is love.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Strengthen me with raisins,</p><p>
    refresh me with apples;</p><p>
    for I am faint with love.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    His left hand is under my head.</p><p>
    His right hand embraces me.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem,</p><p>
    by the roes, or by the hinds of the field,</p><p>
    that you not stir up, nor awaken love,</p><p>
    until it so desires.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    The voice of my beloved!</p><p>
    Behold, he comes,</p><p>
    leaping on the mountains,</p><p>
    skipping on the hills.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    My beloved is like a roe or a young deer.</p><p>
    Behold, he stands behind our wall!</p><p>
    He looks in at the windows.</p><p>
    He glances through the lattice.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    My beloved spoke, and said to me,</p><p>“Rise up, my love, my beautiful one, and come away.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    For behold, the winter is past.</p><p>
    The rain is over and gone.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    The flowers appear on the earth.</p><p>
    The time of the singing has come,</p><p>
    and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    The fig tree ripens her green figs.</p><p>
    The vines are in blossom.</p><p>
    They give out their fragrance.</p><p>
    Arise, my love, my beautiful one,</p><p>
    and come away.”</p><p>Lover</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    My dove in the clefts of the rock,</p><p>
    in the hiding places of the mountainside,</p><p>let me see your face.</p><p>Let me hear your voice;</p><p>
    for your voice is sweet and your face is lovely.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>Catch for us the foxes,</p><p>
    the little foxes that plunder the vineyards;</p><p>
    for our vineyards are in blossom.</p><p>Beloved</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    My beloved is mine, and I am his.</p><p>He browses among the lilies.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away,</p><p>
    turn, my beloved,</p><p>
    and be like a roe or a young deer on the mountains of Bether.</p><a href="#Song of Solomon-c-3"><h3 id="Song of Solomon-c-3">3</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    By night on my bed,</p><p>
    I sought him whom my soul loves.</p><p>
    I sought him, but I didn’t find him.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    I will get up now, and go about the city;</p><p>
    in the streets and in the squares I will seek him whom my soul loves.</p><p>
    I sought him, but I didn’t find him.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    The watchmen who go about the city found me;</p><p>“Have you seen him whom my soul loves?”</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    I had scarcely passed from them,</p><p>
    when I found him whom my soul loves.</p><p>
    I held him, and would not let him go,</p><p>
    until I had brought him into my mother’s house,</p><p>
    into the room of her who conceived me.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem,</p><p>
    by the roes, or by the hinds of the field,</p><p>
    that you not stir up nor awaken love,</p><p>
    until it so desires.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    Who is this who comes up from the wilderness like pillars of smoke,</p><p>
    perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,</p><p>
    with all spices of the merchant?</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    Behold, it is Solomon’s carriage!</p><p>
    Sixty mighty men are around it,</p><p>
    of the mighty men of Israel.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    They all handle the sword, and are expert in war.</p><p>
    Every man has his sword on his thigh,</p><p>
    because of fear in the night.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    King Solomon made himself a carriage</p><p>
    of the wood of Lebanon.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    He made its pillars of silver,</p><p>
    its bottom of gold, its seat of purple,</p><p>
    the middle of it being paved with love,</p><p>
    from the daughters of Jerusalem.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    Go out, you daughters of Zion, and see King Solomon,</p><p>
    with the crown with which his mother has crowned him,</p><p>
    in the day of his weddings,</p><p>
    in the day of the gladness of his heart.</p><a href="#Song of Solomon-c-4"><h3 id="Song of Solomon-c-4">4</h3></a>
<p>Lover</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Behold, you are beautiful, my love.</p><p>
    Behold, you are beautiful.</p><p>
    Your eyes are like doves behind your veil.</p><p>
    Your hair is as a flock of goats,</p><p>
    that descend from Mount Gilead.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    Your teeth are like a newly shorn flock,</p><p>
    which have come up from the washing,</p><p>
    where every one of them has twins.</p><p>
    None is bereaved among them.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    Your lips are like scarlet thread.</p><p>
    Your mouth is lovely.</p><p>
    Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind your veil.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    Your neck is like David’s tower built for an armory,</p><p>
    on which a thousand shields hang,</p><p>
    all the shields of the mighty men.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Your two breasts are like two fawns</p><p>
    that are twins of a roe,</p><p>which feed among the lilies.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away,</p><p>
    I will go to the mountain of myrrh,</p><p>
    to the hill of frankincense.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    You are all beautiful, my love.</p><p>
    There is no spot in you.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Come with me from Lebanon, my bride,</p><p>
    with me from Lebanon.</p><p>
    Look from the top of Amana,</p><p>
    from the top of Senir and Hermon,</p><p>
    from the lions’ dens,</p><p>
    from the mountains of the leopards.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    You have ravished my heart, my sister, my bride.</p><p>
    You have ravished my heart with one of your eyes,</p><p>
    with one chain of your neck.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride!</p><p>
    How much better is your love than wine,</p><p>
    the fragrance of your perfumes than all kinds of spices!</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    Your lips, my bride, drip like the honeycomb.</p><p>
    Honey and milk are under your tongue.</p><p>
    The smell of your garments is like the smell of Lebanon.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>My sister, my bride, is a locked up garden;</p><p>
    a locked up spring,</p><p>
    a sealed fountain.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates, with precious fruits,</p><p>
    henna with spikenard plants,</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    spikenard and saffron,</p><p>
    calamus and cinnamon, with every kind of incense tree;</p><p>
    myrrh and aloes, with all the best spices,</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    a fountain of gardens,</p><p>
    a well of living waters,</p><p>
    flowing streams from Lebanon.</p><p>Beloved</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    Awake, north wind, and come, you south!</p><p>
    Blow on my garden, that its spices may flow out.</p><p>Let my beloved come into his garden,</p><p>
    and taste his precious fruits.</p><a href="#Song of Solomon-c-5"><h3 id="Song of Solomon-c-5">5</h3></a>
<p>Lover</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride.</p><p>I have gathered my myrrh with my spice;</p><p>I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey;</p><p>I have drunk my wine with my milk.</p><p>Friends</p><p>Eat, friends!</p><p>
    Drink, yes, drink abundantly, beloved.</p><p>Beloved</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    I was asleep, but my heart was awake.</p><p>
    It is the voice of my beloved who knocks:</p><p>“Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled;</p><p>
    for my head is filled with dew,</p><p>
    and my hair with the dampness of the night.”</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>I have taken off my robe. Indeed, must I put it on?</p><p>I have washed my feet. Indeed, must I soil them?</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    My beloved thrust his hand in through the latch opening.</p><p>
    My heart pounded for him.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    I rose up to open for my beloved.</p><p>
    My hands dripped with myrrh,</p><p>
    my fingers with liquid myrrh,</p><p>
    on the handles of the lock.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    I opened to my beloved;</p><p>
    but my beloved left, and had gone away.</p><p>
    My heart went out when he spoke.</p><p>
    I looked for him, but I didn’t find him.</p><p>
    I called him, but he didn’t answer.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    The watchmen who go about the city found me.</p><p>
    They beat me.</p><p>
    They bruised me.</p><p>
    The keepers of the walls took my cloak away from me.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem,</p><p>If you find my beloved,</p><p>
    that you tell him that I am faint with love.</p><p>Friends</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    How is your beloved better than another beloved,</p><p>
    you fairest among women?</p><p>
    How is your beloved better than another beloved,</p><p>
    that you do so adjure us?</p><p>Beloved</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>My beloved is white and ruddy.</p><p>
    The best among ten thousand.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    His head is like the purest gold.</p><p>
    His hair is bushy, black as a raven.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    His eyes are like doves beside the water brooks,</p><p>
    washed with milk, mounted like jewels.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    His cheeks are like a bed of spices with towers of perfumes.</p><p>
    His lips are like lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    His hands are like rings of gold set with beryl.</p><p>
    His body is like ivory work overlaid with sapphires.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    His legs are like pillars of marble set on sockets of fine gold.</p><p>
    His appearance is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    His mouth is sweetness;</p><p>yes, he is altogether lovely.</p><p>
    This is my beloved, and this is my friend,</p><p>
    daughters of Jerusalem.</p><a href="#Song of Solomon-c-6"><h3 id="Song of Solomon-c-6">6</h3></a>
<p>Friends</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Where has your beloved gone, you fairest among women?</p><p>Where has your beloved turned, that we may seek him with you?</p><p>Beloved</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    My beloved has gone down to his garden,</p><p>
    to the beds of spices,</p><p>
    to pasture his flock in the gardens, and to gather lilies.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>I am my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine.</p><p>He browses among the lilies.</p><p>Lover</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>You are beautiful, my love, as Tirzah,</p><p>
    lovely as Jerusalem,</p><p>awesome as an army with banners.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Turn away your eyes from me,</p><p>
    for they have overcome me.</p><p>
    Your hair is like a flock of goats,</p><p>
    that lie along the side of Gilead.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    Your teeth are like a flock of ewes,</p><p>
    which have come up from the washing,</p><p>
    of which every one has twins;</p><p>
    not one is bereaved among them.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind your veil.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    There are sixty queens, eighty concubines,</p><p>
    and virgins without number.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    My dove, my perfect one, is unique.</p><p>
    She is her mother’s only daughter.</p><p>
    She is the favorite one of her who bore her.</p><p>
    The daughters saw her, and called her blessed.</p><p>
    The queens and the concubines saw her, and they praised her.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    Who is she who looks out as the morning,</p><p>
    beautiful as the moon,</p><p>
    clear as the sun,</p><p>
    and awesome as an army with banners?</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    I went down into the nut tree grove,</p><p>
    to see the green plants of the valley,</p><p>
    to see whether the vine budded,</p><p>
    and the pomegranates were in flower.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    Without realizing it,</p><p>
    my desire set me with my royal people’s chariots.</p><p>Friends</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Return, return, Shulammite!</p><p>Return, return, that we may gaze at you.</p><p>Lover</p><p>Why do you desire to gaze at the Shulammite,</p><p>as at the dance of Mahanaim?</p><a href="#Song of Solomon-c-7"><h3 id="Song of Solomon-c-7">7</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    How beautiful are your feet in sandals, prince’s daughter!</p><p>
    Your rounded thighs are like jewels,</p><p>
    the work of the hands of a skillful workman.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    Your body is like a round goblet,</p><p>no mixed wine is wanting.</p><p>
    Your waist is like a heap of wheat,</p><p>
    set about with lilies.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Your two breasts are like two fawns,</p><p>that are twins of a roe.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Your neck is like an ivory tower.</p><p>Your eyes are like the pools in Heshbon by the gate of Bathrabbim.</p><p>Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Your head on you is like Carmel.</p><p>
    The hair of your head like purple.</p><p>
    The king is held captive in its tresses.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>How beautiful and how pleasant you are,</p><p>love, for delights!</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    This, your stature, is like a palm tree,</p><p>
    your breasts like its fruit.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    I said, “I will climb up into the palm tree.</p><p>
    I will take hold of its fruit.”</p><p>Let your breasts be like clusters of the vine,</p><p>
    the smell of your breath like apples.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    Your mouth is like the best wine,</p><p>
    that goes down smoothly for my beloved,</p><p>gliding through the lips of those who are asleep.</p><p>Beloved</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    I am my beloved’s.</p><p>
    His desire is toward me.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Come, my beloved! Let’s go out into the field.</p><p>Let’s lodge in the villages.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    Let’s go early up to the vineyards.</p><p>
    Let’s see whether the vine has budded,</p><p>
    its blossom is open,</p><p>
    and the pomegranates are in flower.</p><p>
    There I will give you my love.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    The mandrakes produce fragrance.</p><p>
    At our doors are all kinds of precious fruits, new and old,</p><p>
    which I have stored up for you, my beloved.</p><a href="#Song of Solomon-c-8"><h3 id="Song of Solomon-c-8">8</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Oh that you were like my brother,</p><p>
    who nursed from the breasts of my mother!</p><p>If I found you outside, I would kiss you;</p><p>
    yes, and no one would despise me.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    I would lead you, bringing you into the house of my mother,</p><p>
    who would instruct me.</p><p>
    I would have you drink spiced wine,</p><p>
    of the juice of my pomegranate.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    His left hand would be under my head.</p><p>
    His right hand would embrace me.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem,</p><p>
    that you not stir up, nor awaken love,</p><p>
    until it so desires.</p><p>Friends</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Who is this who comes up from the wilderness,</p><p>
    leaning on her beloved?</p><p>Beloved</p><p>
    Under the apple tree I awakened you.</p><p>
    There your mother conceived you.</p><p>
    There she was in labor and bore you.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    Set me as a seal on your heart,</p><p>
    as a seal on your arm;</p><p>
    for love is strong as death.</p><p>
    Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol.<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="ref-1">†</a></sup></p><p>
    Its flashes are flashes of fire,</p><p>
    a very flame of Yah.<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="ref-2">†</a></sup></p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    Many waters can’t quench love,</p><p>
    neither can floods drown it.</p><p>If a man would give all the wealth of his house for love,</p><p>
    he would be utterly scorned.</p><p>Brothers</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    We have a little sister.</p><p>
    She has no breasts.</p><p>
    What shall we do for our sister</p><p>
    in the day when she is to be spoken for?</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    If she is a wall,</p><p>
    we will build on her a turret of silver.</p><p>
    If she is a door,</p><p>
    we will enclose her with boards of cedar.</p><p>Beloved</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    I am a wall, and my breasts like towers,</p><p>
    then I was in his eyes like one who found peace.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    Solomon had a vineyard at Baal Hamon.</p><p>
    He leased out the vineyard to keepers.</p><p>
    Each was to bring a thousand shekels<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="ref-3">†</a></sup> of silver for its fruit.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    My own vineyard is before me.</p><p>
    The thousand are for you, Solomon,</p><p>
    two hundred for those who tend its fruit.</p><p>Lover</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
