    <sup>1</sup>
    The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ,<sup><a href="#footnote-0" id="ref-0">†</a></sup> the son of David, the son of Abraham.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Abraham became the father of Isaac. Isaac became the father of Jacob. Jacob became the father of Judah and his brothers. <sup>3</sup>Judah became the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar. Perez became the father of Hezron. Hezron became the father of Ram. <sup>4</sup>Ram became the father of Amminadab. Amminadab became the father of Nahshon. Nahshon became the father of Salmon. <sup>5</sup>Salmon became the father of Boaz by Rahab. Boaz became the father of Obed by Ruth. Obed became the father of Jesse. <sup>6</sup>Jesse became the father of King David. David the king<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="ref-1">†</a></sup> became the father of Solomon by her who had been Uriah’s wife. <sup>7</sup>Solomon became the father of Rehoboam. Rehoboam became the father of Abijah. Abijah became the father of Asa. <sup>8</sup>Asa became the father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat became the father of Joram. Joram became the father of Uzziah. <sup>9</sup>Uzziah became the father of Jotham. Jotham became the father of Ahaz. Ahaz became the father of Hezekiah. <sup>10</sup>Hezekiah became the father of Manasseh. Manasseh became the father of Amon. Amon became the father of Josiah. <sup>11</sup>Josiah became the father of Jechoniah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    After the exile to Babylon, Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel became the father of Zerubbabel. <sup>13</sup>Zerubbabel became the father of Abiud. Abiud became the father of Eliakim. Eliakim became the father of Azor. <sup>14</sup>Azor became the father of Zadok. Zadok became the father of Achim. Achim became the father of Eliud. <sup>15</sup>Eliud became the father of Eleazar. Eleazar became the father of Matthan. Matthan became the father of Jacob. <sup>16</sup>Jacob became the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, from whom was born Jesus,<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="ref-2">†</a></sup> who is called Christ.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; from David to the exile to Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon to the Christ, fourteen generations.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this: After his mother, Mary, was engaged to Joseph, before they came together, she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit. <sup>19</sup>Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, intended to put her away secretly. <sup>20</sup>But when he thought about these things, behold,<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="ref-3">†</a></sup> an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, don’t be afraid to take to yourself Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. <sup>21</sup>She shall give birth to a son. You shall name him Jesus,<sup><a href="#footnote-4" id="ref-4">†</a></sup> for it is he who shall save his people from their sins.”</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    Now all this has happened that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>“Behold, the virgin shall be with child,</p><p>
    and shall give birth to a son.</p><p>
    They shall call his name Immanuel,”</p><p>
    which is, being interpreted, “God with us.”<sup><a href="#footnote-5" id="ref-5">†</a></sup></p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took his wife to himself; <sup>25</sup>and didn’t know her sexually until she had given birth to her firstborn son. He named him Jesus.</p><a href="#Matthew-c-2"><h3 id="Matthew-c-2">2</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, behold, wise men<sup><a href="#footnote-6" id="ref-6">†</a></sup> from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, <sup>2</sup>“Where is he who is born King of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him.” <sup>3</sup>When King Herod heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. <sup>4</sup>Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ would be born. <sup>5</sup>They said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is written through the prophet,</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>‘You Bethlehem, land of Judah,</p><p>
    are in no way least among the princes of Judah;</p><p>
    for out of you shall come a governor</p><p>
    who shall shepherd my people, Israel.’”<sup><a href="#footnote-7" id="ref-7">†</a></sup></p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    Then Herod secretly called the wise men, and learned from them exactly what time the star appeared. <sup>8</sup>He sent them to Bethlehem, and said, “Go and search diligently for the young child. When you have found him, bring me word, so that I also may come and worship him.”</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    They, having heard the king, went their way; and behold, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them until it came and stood over where the young child was. <sup>10</sup>When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy. <sup>11</sup>They came into the house and saw the young child with Mary, his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Opening their treasures, they offered to him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh. <sup>12</sup>Being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they went back to their own country another way.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, “Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.”</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    He arose and took the young child and his mother by night and departed into Egypt, <sup>15</sup>and was there until the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, “Out of Egypt I called my son.”<sup><a href="#footnote-8" id="ref-8">†</a></sup></p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men, was exceedingly angry, and sent out and killed all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all the surrounding countryside, from two years old and under, according to the exact time which he had learned from the wise men. <sup>17</sup>Then that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying,</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>“A voice was heard in Ramah,</p><p>lamentation, weeping and great mourning,</p><p>
    Rachel weeping for her children;</p><p>
    she wouldn’t be comforted,</p><p>
    because they are no more.”<sup><a href="#footnote-9" id="ref-9">†</a></sup></p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, <sup>20</sup>“Arise and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel, for those who sought the young child’s life are dead.”</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    He arose and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. <sup>22</sup>But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in the place of his father, Herod, he was afraid to go there. Being warned in a dream, he withdrew into the region of Galilee, <sup>23</sup>and came and lived in a city called Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets that he will be called a Nazarene.</p><a href="#Matthew-c-3"><h3 id="Matthew-c-3">3</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    In those days, John the Baptizer came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying, <sup>2</sup>“Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!” <sup>3</sup>For this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying,</p><p>“The voice of one crying in the wilderness,</p><p>
    make the way of the Lord ready!</p><p>
    Make his paths straight!”<sup><a href="#footnote-10" id="ref-10">†</a></sup></p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    Now John himself wore clothing made of camel’s hair with a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey. <sup>5</sup>Then people from Jerusalem, all of Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him. <sup>6</sup>They were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his baptism, he said to them, “You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? <sup>8</sup>Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentance! <sup>9</sup>Don’t think to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our father,’ for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones. <sup>10</sup>Even now the ax lies at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that doesn’t produce good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>“I indeed baptize you in water for repentance, but he who comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.<sup><a href="#footnote-11" id="ref-11">†</a></sup> <sup>12</sup>His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor. He will gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.”</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan<sup><a href="#footnote-12" id="ref-12">†</a></sup> to John, to be baptized by him. <sup>14</sup>But John would have hindered him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and you come to me?”</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    But Jesus, answering, said to him, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Allow it now, for this is the fitting way for us to fulfill all righteousness.”</span> Then he allowed him.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    Jesus, when he was baptized, went up directly from the water: and behold, the heavens were opened to him. He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming on him. <sup>17</sup>Behold, a voice out of the heavens said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.”</p><a href="#Matthew-c-4"><h3 id="Matthew-c-4">4</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. <sup>2</sup>When he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was hungry afterward. <sup>3</sup>The tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.”</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    But he answered, <span class="words-of-jesus">“It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of God’s mouth.’”</span><sup><a href="#footnote-13" id="ref-13">†</a></sup></p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Then the devil took him into the holy city. He set him on the pinnacle of the temple, <sup>6</sup>and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written,</p><p>‘He will command his angels concerning you,’ and,</p><p>‘On their hands they will bear you up,</p><p>
    so that you don’t dash your foot against a stone.’”<sup><a href="#footnote-14" id="ref-14">†</a></sup></p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    Jesus said to him, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Again, it is written, ‘You shall not test the Lord, your God.’”</span><sup><a href="#footnote-15" id="ref-15">†</a></sup></p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    Again, the devil took him to an exceedingly high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. <sup>9</sup>He said to him, “I will give you all of these things, if you will fall down and worship me.”</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    Then Jesus said to him, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Get behind me,</span><sup><a href="#footnote-16" id="ref-16">†</a></sup> <span class="words-of-jesus">Satan! For it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him only.’”</span> <sup><a href="#footnote-17" id="ref-17">†</a></sup></p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and served him.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    Now when Jesus heard that John was delivered up, he withdrew into Galilee. <sup>13</sup>Leaving Nazareth, he came and lived in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali, <sup>14</sup>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>“The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,</p><p>toward the sea, beyond the Jordan,</p><p>
    Galilee of the Gentiles,</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    the people who sat in darkness saw a great light;</p><p>
    to those who sat in the region and shadow of death,</p><p>
    to them light has dawned.”<sup><a href="#footnote-18" id="ref-18">†</a></sup></p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    From that time, Jesus began to preach, and to say, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Repent! For the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    Walking by the sea of Galilee, he<sup><a href="#footnote-19" id="ref-19">†</a></sup> saw two brothers: Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen. <sup>19</sup>He said to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Come after me, and I will make you fishers for men.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    They immediately left their nets and followed him. <sup>21</sup>Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. He called them. <sup>22</sup>They immediately left the boat and their father, and followed him.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    Jesus went about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people. <sup>24</sup>The report about him went out into all Syria. They brought to him all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases and torments, possessed with demons, epileptics, and paralytics; and he healed them. <sup>25</sup>Great multitudes from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and from beyond the Jordan followed him.</p><a href="#Matthew-c-5"><h3 id="Matthew-c-5">5</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Seeing the multitudes, he went up onto the mountain. When he had sat down, his disciples came to him. <sup>2</sup>He opened his mouth and taught them, saying,</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    <span class="words-of-jesus">“Blessed are the poor in spirit,</span></p><p>

    <sup>13</sup>
    <span class="words-of-jesus">“You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has lost its flavor, with what will it be salted? It is then good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men. </span></p><p>

    <span class="words-of-jesus">“Don’t think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets. I didn’t come to destroy, but to fulfill. </span> <sup>18</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">For most certainly, I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not even one smallest letter</span><sup><a href="#footnote-24" id="ref-24">†</a></sup> <span class="words-of-jesus">or one tiny pen stroke</span><sup><a href="#footnote-25" id="ref-25">†</a></sup> <span class="words-of-jesus">shall in any way pass away from the law, until all things are accomplished. </span> <sup>19</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Therefore, whoever shall break one of these least commandments and teach others to do so, shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven; but whoever shall do and teach them shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven. </span> <sup>20</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, there is no way you will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</span></p><p>

    When he came down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him. <sup>2</sup>Behold, a leper came to him and worshiped him, saying, “Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean.”</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, <span class="words-of-jesus">“I want to. Be made clean.”</span> Immediately his leprosy was cleansed. <sup>4</sup>Jesus said to him, <span class="words-of-jesus">“See that you tell nobody; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    When he came into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking him for help, <sup>6</sup>saying, “Lord, my servant lies in the house paralyzed, grievously tormented.”</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    Jesus said to him, <span class="words-of-jesus">“I will come and heal him.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    The centurion answered, “Lord, I’m not worthy for you to come under my roof. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed. <sup>9</sup>For I am also a man under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and tell another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and tell my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    When Jesus heard it, he marveled and said to those who followed, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Most certainly I tell you, I haven’t found so great a faith, not even in Israel. </span> <sup>11</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">I tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven, </span> <sup>12</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">but the children of the Kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness.

Let it be done for you as you have believed.”</span> His servant was healed in that hour.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    When Jesus came into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s mother lying sick with a fever. <sup>15</sup>He touched her hand, and the fever left her. So she got up and served him.<sup><a href="#footnote-45" id="ref-45">†</a></sup> <sup>16</sup>When evening came, they brought to him many possessed with demons. He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick, <sup>17</sup>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, “He took our infirmities and bore our diseases.”<sup><a href="#footnote-46" id="ref-46">†</a></sup></p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    Now when Jesus saw great multitudes around him, he gave the order to depart to the other side.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    A scribe came and said to him, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    Jesus said to him, <span class="words-of-jesus">“The foxes have holes and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    Another of his disciples said to him, “Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.”</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    But Jesus said to him, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    When he got into a boat, his disciples followed him. <sup>24</sup>Behold, a violent storm came up on the sea, so much that the boat was covered with the waves; but he was asleep. <sup>25</sup>The disciples came to him and woke him up, saying, “Save us, Lord! We are dying!”</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    He said to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?” </span> Then he got up, rebuked the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>
    The men marveled, saying, “What kind of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?”</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>
    When he came to the other side, into the country of the Gergesenes,<sup><a href="#footnote-47" id="ref-47">†</a></sup> two people possessed by demons met him there, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that nobody could pass that way. <sup>29</sup>Behold, they cried out, saying, “What do we have to do with you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?” <sup>30</sup>Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding far away from them. <sup>31</sup>The demons begged him, saying, “If you cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of pigs.”</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>
    He said to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Go!”</span></p><p>
    They came out and went into the herd of pigs; and behold, the whole herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea and died in the water. <sup>33</sup>Those who fed them fled and went away into the city and told everything, including what happened to those who were possessed with demons. <sup>34</sup>Behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged that he would depart from their borders.</p><a href="#Matthew-c-9"><h3 id="Matthew-c-9">9</h3></a>

    <sup>1</sup>
    He entered into a boat and crossed over, and came into his own city. <sup>2</sup>Behold, they brought to him a man who was paralyzed, lying on a bed. Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Son, cheer up! Your sins are forgiven you.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    Behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, “This man blasphemes.”</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Why do you think evil in your hearts? </span> <sup>5</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">For which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven;’ or to say, ‘Get up, and walk’? </span> <sup>6</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins—”</span> (then he said to the paralytic), <span class="words-of-jesus">“Get up, and take up your mat, and go to your house.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    He arose and departed to his house. <sup>8</sup>But when the multitudes saw it, they marveled and glorified God, who had given such authority to men.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    As Jesus passed by from there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax collection office. He said to him, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Follow me.”</span> He got up and followed him. <sup>10</sup>As he sat in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples. <sup>11</sup>When the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    When Jesus heard it, he said to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do. </span> <sup>13</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">But you go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,’</span><sup><a href="#footnote-48" id="ref-48">†</a></sup> <span class="words-of-jesus">for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”</span><sup><a href="#footnote-49" id="ref-49">†</a></sup></p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    Then John’s disciples came to him, saying, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples don’t fast?”</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    Jesus said to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast. </span> <sup>16</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch would tear away from the garment, and a worse hole is made. </span> <sup>17</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Neither do people put new wine into old wineskins, or else the skins would burst, and the wine be spilled, and the skins ruined. No, they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    While he told these things to them, behold, a ruler came and worshiped him, saying, “My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live.”</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    Jesus got up and followed him, as did his disciples. <sup>20</sup>Behold, a woman who had a discharge of blood for twelve years came behind him, and touched the fringe<sup><a href="#footnote-50" id="ref-50">†</a></sup> of his garment; <sup>21</sup>for she said within herself, “If I just touch his garment, I will be made well.”</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    But Jesus, turning around and seeing her, said, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Daughter, cheer up! Your faith has made you well.”</span> And the woman was made well from that hour.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    When Jesus came into the ruler’s house and saw the flute players and the crowd in noisy disorder, <sup>24</sup>he said to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Make room, because the girl isn’t dead, but sleeping.”</span></p><p>
    They were ridiculing him. <sup>25</sup>But when the crowd was sent out, he entered in, took her by the hand, and the girl arose. <sup>26</sup>The report of this went out into all that land.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>
    As Jesus passed by from there, two blind men followed him, calling out and saying, “Have mercy on us, son of David!” <sup>28</sup>When he had come into the house, the blind men came to him. Jesus said to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Do you believe that I am able to do this?”</span></p><p>
    They told him, “Yes, Lord.”</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>
    Then he touched their eyes, saying, <span class="words-of-jesus">“According to your faith be it done to you.”</span> <sup>30</sup>Then their eyes were opened. Jesus strictly commanded them, saying, <span class="words-of-jesus">“See that no one knows about this.”</span> <sup>31</sup>But they went out and spread abroad his fame in all that land.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>
    As they went out, behold, a mute man who was demon possessed was brought to him. <sup>33</sup>When the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke. The multitudes marveled, saying, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!”</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>
    But the Pharisees said, “By the prince of the demons, he casts out demons.”</p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>
    Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people. <sup>36</sup>But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them because they were harassed<sup><a href="#footnote-51" id="ref-51">†</a></sup> and scattered, like sheep without a shepherd. <sup>37</sup>Then he said to his disciples, <span class="words-of-jesus">“The harvest indeed is plentiful, but the laborers are few. </span> <sup>38</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Pray therefore that the Lord of the harvest will send out laborers into his harvest.”</span></p><a href="#Matthew-c-10"><h3 id="Matthew-c-10">10</h3></a>

    <sup>1</sup>
    He called to himself his twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every sickness. <sup>2</sup>Now the names of the twelve apostles are these. The first, Simon, who is called Peter; Andrew, his brother; James the son of Zebedee; John, his brother; <sup>3</sup>Philip; Bartholomew; Thomas; Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus; Lebbaeus, who was also called<sup><a href="#footnote-52" id="ref-52">†</a></sup> Thaddaeus; <sup>4</sup>Simon the Zealot; and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.</p><p>

    <sup>1</sup>
    When Jesus had finished directing his twelve disciples, he departed from there to teach and preach in their cities.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    Now when John heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples <sup>3</sup>and said to him, “Are you he who comes, or should we look for another?”</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    Jesus answered them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Go and tell John the things which you hear and see: </span> <sup>5</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear,</span><sup><a href="#footnote-58" id="ref-58">†</a></sup> <span class="words-of-jesus">the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them.</span><sup><a href="#footnote-59" id="ref-59">†</a></sup> <sup>6</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Blessed is he who finds no occasion for stumbling in me.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    As these went their way, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John, <span class="words-of-jesus">“What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? </span> <sup>8</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">But what did you go out to see? A man in soft clothing?

    <span class="words-of-jesus">“But to what shall I compare this generation?

    <sup>20</sup>
    Then he began to denounce the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done, because they didn’t repent. <sup>21</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">“Woe to you, Chorazin!

    <sup>25</sup>
    At that time, Jesus answered, <span class="words-of-jesus">“I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you hid these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to infants. </span> <sup>26</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight. </span> <sup>27</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">All things have been delivered to me by my Father.

<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    At that time, Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the grain fields. His disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat. <sup>2</sup>But the Pharisees, when they saw it, said to him, “Behold, your disciples do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.”</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    But he said to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Haven’t you read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him: </span> <sup>4</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">how he entered into God’s house and ate the show bread, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests?</span><sup><a href="#footnote-64" id="ref-64">†</a></sup> <sup>5</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath day the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless? </span> <sup>6</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">But I tell you that one greater than the temple is here. </span> <sup>7</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">But if you had known what this means, ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,’</span><sup><a href="#footnote-65" id="ref-65">†</a></sup> <span class="words-of-jesus">you wouldn’t have condemned the guiltless. </span> <sup>8</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    He departed from there and went into their synagogue. <sup>10</sup>And behold, there was a man with a withered hand. They asked him, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day?” so that they might accuse him.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    He said to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“What man is there among you who has one sheep, and if this one falls into a pit on the Sabbath day, won’t he grab on to it and lift it out? </span> <sup>12</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Of how much more value then is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath day.”</span> <sup>13</sup>Then he told the man, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Stretch out your hand.”</span> He stretched it out; and it was restored whole, just like the other. <sup>14</sup>But the Pharisees went out and conspired against him, how they might destroy him.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    Jesus, perceiving that, withdrew from there. Great multitudes followed him; and he healed them all, <sup>16</sup>and commanded them that they should not make him known, <sup>17</sup>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>“Behold, my servant whom I have chosen,</p><p>
    my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased.</p><p>
    I will put my Spirit on him.</p><p>
    He will proclaim justice to the nations.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    He will not strive, nor shout,</p><p>
    neither will anyone hear his voice in the streets.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    He won’t break a bruised reed.</p><p>
    He won’t quench a smoking flax,</p><p>
    until he leads justice to victory.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    In his name, the nations will hope.”<sup><a href="#footnote-66" id="ref-66">†</a></sup></p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    Then one possessed by a demon, blind and mute, was brought to him; and he healed him, so that the blind and mute man both spoke and saw. <sup>23</sup>All the multitudes were amazed, and said, “Can this be the son of David?” <sup>24</sup>But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, “This man does not cast out demons except by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.”</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand. </span> <sup>26</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand? </span> <sup>27</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">If I by Beelzebul cast out demons, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. </span> <sup>28</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then God’s Kingdom has come upon you. </span> <sup>29</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Or how can one enter into the house of the strong man and plunder his goods, unless he first bind the strong man? Then he will plunder his house.</span></p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>
    <span class="words-of-jesus">“He who is not with me is against me, and he who doesn’t gather with me, scatters. </span> <sup>31</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven men. </span> <sup>32</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, either in this age, or in that which is to come.</span></p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>
    <span class="words-of-jesus">“Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt; for the tree is known by its fruit. </span> <sup>34</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">You offspring of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks. </span> <sup>35</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">The good man out of his good treasure</span><sup><a href="#footnote-67" id="ref-67">†</a></sup> <span class="words-of-jesus">brings out good things, and the evil man out of his evil treasure brings out evil things. </span> <sup>36</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">I tell you that every idle word that men speak, they will give account of it in the day of judgment. </span> <sup>37</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>38</sup>
    Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.”</p><p>
    <sup>39</sup>
    But he answered them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, but no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet. </span> <sup>40</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the huge fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. </span> <sup>41</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, someone greater than Jonah is here. </span> <sup>42</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">The Queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, someone greater than Solomon is here. </span></p><p>
    <sup>43</sup>
    <span class="words-of-jesus">“When an unclean spirit has gone out of a man, he passes through waterless places seeking rest, and doesn’t find it. </span> <sup>44</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Then he says, ‘I will return into my house from which I came;’ and when he has come back, he finds it empty, swept, and put in order. </span> <sup>45</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Then he goes and takes with himself seven other spirits more evil than he is, and they enter in and dwell there. The last state of that man becomes worse than the first. Even so will it be also to this evil generation.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>46</sup>
    While he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother and his brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to him. <sup>47</sup>One said to him, “Behold, your mother and your brothers stand outside, seeking to speak to you.”</p><p>
    <sup>48</sup>
    But he answered him who spoke to him, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?”</span> <sup>49</sup>He stretched out his hand toward his disciples, and said, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Behold, my mother and my brothers! </span> <sup>50</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.”</span></p><a href="#Matthew-c-13"><h3 id="Matthew-c-13">13</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    On that day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the seaside. <sup>2</sup>Great multitudes gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat and sat; and all the multitude stood on the beach. <sup>3</sup>He spoke to them many things in parables, saying, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Behold, a farmer went out to sow. </span> <sup>4</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">As he sowed, some seeds fell by the roadside, and the birds came and devoured them. </span> <sup>5</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Others fell on rocky ground, where they didn’t have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, because they had no depth of earth. </span> <sup>6</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">When the sun had risen, they were scorched. Because they had no root, they withered away. </span> <sup>7</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Others fell among thorns. The thorns grew up and choked them. </span> <sup>8</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Others fell on good soil and yielded fruit: some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty. </span> <sup>9</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    The disciples came, and said to him, “Why do you speak to them in parables?”</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    He answered them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but it is not given to them. </span> <sup>12</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">For whoever has, to him will be given, and he will have abundance; but whoever doesn’t have, from him will be taken away even that which he has. </span> <sup>13</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they don’t see, and hearing, they don’t hear, neither do they understand. </span> <sup>14</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">In them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, which says, </span></p><p>
    <span class="words-of-jesus">‘By hearing you will hear,</span></p><p>

    <sup>16</sup>
    <span class="words-of-jesus">“But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear. </span> <sup>17</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">For most certainly I tell you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you see, and didn’t see them; and to hear the things which you hear, and didn’t hear them.</span></p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    <span class="words-of-jesus">“Hear, then, the parable of the farmer. </span> <sup>19</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">When anyone hears the word of the Kingdom and doesn’t understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown by the roadside. </span> <sup>20</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">What was sown on the rocky places, this is he who hears the word and immediately with joy receives it; </span> <sup>21</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he stumbles. </span> <sup>22</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">What was sown among the thorns, this is he who hears the word, but the cares of this age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful. </span> <sup>23</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">What was sown on the good ground, this is he who hears the word and understands it, who most certainly bears fruit and produces, some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    He set another parable before them, saying, <span class="words-of-jesus">“The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field, </span> <sup>25</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">but while people slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel weeds</span><sup><a href="#footnote-69" id="ref-69">†</a></sup> <span class="words-of-jesus">also among the wheat, and went away. </span> <sup>26</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">But when the blade sprang up and produced grain, then the darnel weeds appeared also. </span> <sup>27</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">The servants of the householder came and said to him, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field?

    <sup>28</sup>
    <span class="words-of-jesus">“He said to them, ‘An enemy has done this.’</span></p><p>
    <span class="words-of-jesus">“The servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and gather them up?’ </span></p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>
    <span class="words-of-jesus">“But he said, ‘No, lest perhaps while you gather up the darnel weeds, you root up the wheat with them. </span> <sup>30</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Let both grow together until the harvest, and in the harvest time I will tell the reapers, “First, gather up the darnel weeds, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.”’”</span></p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>
    He set another parable before them, saying, <span class="words-of-jesus">“The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took, and sowed in his field, </span> <sup>32</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">which indeed is smaller than all seeds. But when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>
    He spoke another parable to them. <span class="words-of-jesus">“The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast which a woman took and hid in three measures</span><sup><a href="#footnote-70" id="ref-70">†</a></sup> <span class="words-of-jesus">of meal, until it was all leavened.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>
    Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the multitudes; and without a parable, he didn’t speak to them, <sup>35</sup>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,</p><p>“I will open my mouth in parables;</p><p>
    I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.”<sup><a href="#footnote-71" id="ref-71">†</a></sup></p><p>
    <sup>36</sup>
    Then Jesus sent the multitudes away, and went into the house. His disciples came to him, saying, “Explain to us the parable of the darnel weeds of the field.”</p><p>
    <sup>37</sup>
    He answered them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man, </span> <sup>38</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">the field is the world, the good seeds are the children of the Kingdom, and the darnel weeds are the children of the evil one. </span> <sup>39</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">The enemy who sowed them is the devil.

    <sup>44</sup>
    <span class="words-of-jesus">“Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid. In his joy, he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.</span></p><p>
    <sup>45</sup>
    <span class="words-of-jesus">“Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a merchant seeking fine pearls, </span> <sup>46</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">who having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had and bought it.</span></p><p>
    <sup>47</sup>
    <span class="words-of-jesus">“Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a dragnet that was cast into the sea and gathered some fish of every kind, </span> <sup>48</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">which, when it was filled, fishermen drew up on the beach.

    They answered him, “Yes, Lord.”</p><p>
    <sup>52</sup>
    He said to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Therefore every scribe who has been made a disciple in the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a householder, who brings out of his treasure new and old things.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>53</sup>
    When Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there. <sup>54</sup>Coming into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished and said, “Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works? <sup>55</sup>Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother called Mary, and his brothers James, Joses, Simon, and Judas?<sup><a href="#footnote-73" id="ref-73">†</a></sup> <sup>56</sup>Aren’t all of his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all of these things?” <sup>57</sup>They were offended by him.</p><p>
    But Jesus said to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country and in his own house.”</span> <sup>58</sup>He didn’t do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.</p><a href="#Matthew-c-14"><h3 id="Matthew-c-14">14</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus, <sup>2</sup>and said to his servants, “This is John the Baptizer. He is risen from the dead. That is why these powers work in him.” <sup>3</sup>For Herod had arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife. <sup>4</sup>For John said to him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.” <sup>5</sup>When he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet. <sup>6</sup>But when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced among them and pleased Herod. <sup>7</sup>Therefore he promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask. <sup>8</sup>She, being prompted by her mother, said, “Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptizer.”</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    The king was grieved, but for the sake of his oaths and of those who sat at the table with him, he commanded it to be given, <sup>10</sup>and he sent and beheaded John in the prison. <sup>11</sup>His head was brought on a platter and given to the young lady; and she brought it to her mother. <sup>12</sup>His disciples came, took the body, and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. <sup>13</sup>Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a deserted place apart. When the multitudes heard it, they followed him on foot from the cities.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    Jesus went out, and he saw a great multitude. He had compassion on them and healed their sick. <sup>15</sup>When evening had come, his disciples came to him, saying, “This place is deserted, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food.”</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    But Jesus said to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“They don’t need to go away. You give them something to eat.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    They told him, “We only have here five loaves and two fish.”</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    He said, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Bring them here to me.”</span> <sup>19</sup>He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, broke and gave the loaves to the disciples; and the disciples gave to the multitudes. <sup>20</sup>They all ate and were filled. They took up twelve baskets full of that which remained left over from the broken pieces. <sup>21</sup>Those who ate were about five thousand men, in addition to women and children.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent the multitudes away. <sup>23</sup>After he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain by himself to pray. When evening had come, he was there alone. <sup>24</sup>But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, distressed by the waves, for the wind was contrary. <sup>25</sup>In the fourth watch of the night,<sup><a href="#footnote-74" id="ref-74">†</a></sup> Jesus came to them, walking on the sea.<sup><a href="#footnote-75" id="ref-75">†</a></sup> <sup>26</sup>When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, “It’s a ghost!” and they cried out for fear. <sup>27</sup>But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Cheer up! It is I! </span><sup><a href="#footnote-76" id="ref-76">†</a></sup> <span class="words-of-jesus">Don’t be afraid.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>
    Peter answered him and said, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the waters.”</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>
    He said, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Come!”</span></p><p>
    Peter stepped down from the boat and walked on the waters to come to Jesus. <sup>30</sup>But when he saw that the wind was strong, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, “Lord, save me!”</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>
    Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand, took hold of him, and said to him, <span class="words-of-jesus">“You of little faith, why did you doubt?”</span> <sup>32</sup>When they got up into the boat, the wind ceased. <sup>33</sup>Those who were in the boat came and worshiped him, saying, “You are truly the Son of God!”</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>
    When they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret. <sup>35</sup>When the people of that place recognized him, they sent into all that surrounding region and brought to him all who were sick; <sup>36</sup>and they begged him that they might just touch the fringe<sup><a href="#footnote-77" id="ref-77">†</a></sup> of his garment. As many as touched it were made whole.</p><a href="#Matthew-c-15"><h3 id="Matthew-c-15">15</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying, <sup>2</sup>“Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they don’t wash their hands when they eat bread.”</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    He answered them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition? </span> <sup>4</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">For God commanded, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’</span><sup><a href="#footnote-78" id="ref-78">†</a></sup> <span class="words-of-jesus">and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.’</span><sup><a href="#footnote-79" id="ref-79">†</a></sup> <sup>5</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">But you say, ‘Whoever may tell his father or his mother, “Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to God,” </span> <sup>6</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">he shall not honor his father or mother.’ You have made the commandment of God void because of your tradition. </span> <sup>7</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,</span></p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    <span class="words-of-jesus">‘These people draw near to me with their mouth,</span></p><p>
    <span class="words-of-jesus">
      and honor me with their lips;</span></p><p>
    <span class="words-of-jesus">
      but their heart is far from me.</span></p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    <span class="words-of-jesus">
      And they worship me in vain,</span></p><p>
    <span class="words-of-jesus">
      teaching as doctrine rules made by men.’”</span>
    <sup><a href="#footnote-80" id="ref-80">†</a></sup></p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    He summoned the multitude, and said to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Hear, and understand. </span> <sup>11</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">That which enters into the mouth doesn’t defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    Then the disciples came and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?”</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    But he answered, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Every plant which my heavenly Father didn’t plant will be uprooted. </span> <sup>14</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Leave them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    Peter answered him, “Explain the parable to us.”</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    So Jesus said, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Do you also still not understand? </span> <sup>17</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Don’t you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly and then out of the body? </span> <sup>18</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the man. </span> <sup>19</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and blasphemies. </span> <sup>20</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn’t defile the man.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    Jesus went out from there and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon. <sup>22</sup>Behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders and cried, saying, “Have mercy on me, Lord, you son of David! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon!”</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    But he answered her not a word.</p><p>
    His disciples came and begged him, saying, “Send her away; for she cries after us.”</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    But he answered, <span class="words-of-jesus">“I wasn’t sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    But she came and worshiped him, saying, “Lord, help me.”</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    But he answered, <span class="words-of-jesus">“It is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>
    But she said, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.”</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>
    Then Jesus answered her, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire.”</span> And her daughter was healed from that hour.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>
    Jesus departed from there and came near to the sea of Galilee; and he went up on the mountain and sat there. <sup>30</sup>Great multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others, and they put them down at his feet. He healed them, <sup>31</sup>so that the multitude wondered when they saw the mute speaking, the injured healed, the lame walking, and the blind seeing—and they glorified the God of Israel.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>
    Jesus summoned his disciples and said, <span class="words-of-jesus">“I have compassion on the multitude, because they have continued with me now three days and have nothing to eat. I don’t want to send them away fasting, or they might faint on the way.” </span></p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>
    The disciples said to him, “Where could we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude?”</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>
    Jesus said to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“How many loaves do you have?”</span></p><p>
    They said, “Seven, and a few small fish.”</p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>
    He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground; <sup>36</sup>and he took the seven loaves and the fish. He gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes. <sup>37</sup>They all ate and were filled. They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over. <sup>38</sup>Those who ate were four thousand men, in addition to women and children. <sup>39</sup>Then he sent away the multitudes, got into the boat, and came into the borders of Magdala.</p><a href="#Matthew-c-16"><h3 id="Matthew-c-16">16</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    The Pharisees and Sadducees came, and testing him, asked him to show them a sign from heaven. <sup>2</sup>But he answered them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“When it is evening, you say, ‘It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.’ </span> <sup>3</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">In the morning, ‘It will be foul weather today, for the sky is red and threatening.’ Hypocrites! You know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but you can’t discern the signs of the times! </span> <sup>4</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and there will be no sign given to it, except the sign of the prophet Jonah.”</span></p><p>
    He left them and departed. <sup>5</sup>The disciples came to the other side and had forgotten to take bread. <sup>6</sup>Jesus said to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    They reasoned among themselves, saying, “We brought no bread.”</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    Jesus, perceiving it, said, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Why do you reason among yourselves, you of little faith, because you have brought no bread? </span> <sup>9</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Don’t you yet perceive or remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up, </span> <sup>10</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up? </span> <sup>11</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">How is it that you don’t perceive that I didn’t speak to you concerning bread? But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” </span></p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    Then they understood that he didn’t tell them to beware of the yeast of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?”</span></p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    They said, “Some say John the Baptizer, some, Elijah, and others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    He said to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“But who do you say that I am?”</span></p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    Jesus answered him, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Blessed are you, Simon Bar Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. </span> <sup>18</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">I also tell you that you are Peter,</span><sup><a href="#footnote-81" id="ref-81">†</a></sup> <span class="words-of-jesus">and on this rock </span><sup><a href="#footnote-82" id="ref-82">†</a></sup> <span class="words-of-jesus">I will build my assembly, and the gates of Hades</span><sup><a href="#footnote-83" id="ref-83">†</a></sup> <span class="words-of-jesus">will not prevail against it. </span> <sup>19</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">I will give to you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven; and whatever you release on earth will have been released in heaven.”</span> <sup>20</sup>Then he commanded the disciples that they should tell no one that he was Jesus the Christ.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    From that time, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, “Far be it from you, Lord! This will never be done to you.”</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    But he turned and said to Peter, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    Then Jesus said to his disciples, <span class="words-of-jesus">“If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me. </span> <sup>25</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, and whoever will lose his life for my sake will find it. </span> <sup>26</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life? Or what will a man give in exchange for his life? </span> <sup>27</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">For the Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will give to everyone according to his deeds. </span> <sup>28</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Most certainly I tell you, there are some standing here who will in no way taste of death until they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom.” </span></p><a href="#Matthew-c-17"><h3 id="Matthew-c-17">17</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    After six days, Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John his brother, and brought them up into a high mountain by themselves. <sup>2</sup>He was changed<sup><a href="#footnote-84" id="ref-84">†</a></sup> before them. His face shone like the sun, and his garments became as white as the light. <sup>3</sup>Behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them talking with him.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    Peter answered and said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, let’s make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. Behold, a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him.”</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces, and were very afraid. <sup>7</sup>Jesus came and touched them and said, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Get up, and don’t be afraid.” </span> <sup>8</sup>Lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus alone.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Don’t tell anyone what you saw, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    His disciples asked him, saying, “Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    Jesus answered them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Elijah indeed comes first, and will restore all things; </span> <sup>12</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">but I tell you that Elijah has come already, and they didn’t recognize him, but did to him whatever they wanted to. Even so the Son of Man will also suffer by them.”</span> <sup>13</sup>Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptizer.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    When they came to the multitude, a man came to him, kneeling down to him and saying, <sup>15</sup>“Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic and suffers grievously; for he often falls into the fire, and often into the water. <sup>16</sup>So I brought him to your disciples, and they could not cure him.”</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    Jesus answered, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Faithless and perverse generation! How long will I be with you? How long will I bear with you? Bring him here to me.”</span> <sup>18</sup>Jesus rebuked the demon, and it went out of him, and the boy was cured from that hour.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    Then the disciples came to Jesus privately, and said, “Why weren’t we able to cast it out?”</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    He said to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Because of your unbelief. For most certainly I tell you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will tell this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you. </span> <sup>21</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">But this kind doesn’t go out except by prayer and fasting.” </span><sup><a href="#footnote-85" id="ref-85">†</a></sup></p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    While they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“The Son of Man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men, </span> <sup>23</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">and they will kill him, and the third day he will be raised up.” </span></p><p>
    They were exceedingly sorry.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    When they had come to Capernaum, those who collected the didrachma coins<sup><a href="#footnote-86" id="ref-86">†</a></sup> came to Peter, and said, “Doesn’t your teacher pay the didrachma?” <sup>25</sup>He said, “Yes.”</p><p>
    When he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, <span class="words-of-jesus">“What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive toll or tribute? From their children, or from strangers?”</span></p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>Peter said to him, “From strangers.”</p><p>
    Jesus said to him, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Therefore the children are exempt. </span> <sup>27</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">But, lest we cause them to stumble, go to the sea, cast a hook, and take up the first fish that comes up. When you have opened its mouth, you will find a stater coin.</span><sup><a href="#footnote-87" id="ref-87">†</a></sup> <span class="words-of-jesus">Take that, and give it to them for me and you.”</span></p><a href="#Matthew-c-18"><h3 id="Matthew-c-18">18</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, “Who then is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?”</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    Jesus called a little child to himself, and set him in the middle of them <sup>3</sup>and said, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Most certainly I tell you, unless you turn and become as little children, you will in no way enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. </span> <sup>4</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Whoever therefore humbles himself as this little child is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven. </span> <sup>5</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Whoever receives one such little child in my name receives me, </span> <sup>6</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him if a huge millstone were hung around his neck and that he were sunk in the depths of the sea. </span></p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    <span class="words-of-jesus">“Woe to the world because of occasions of stumbling! For it must be that the occasions come, but woe to that person through whom the occasion comes! </span> <sup>8</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life maimed or crippled, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire. </span> <sup>9</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna</span><sup><a href="#footnote-88" id="ref-88">†</a></sup> <span class="words-of-jesus">of fire. </span> <sup>10</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">See that you don’t despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven. </span> <sup>11</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">For the Son of Man came to save that which was lost.</span><sup><a href="#footnote-89" id="ref-89">†</a></sup></p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    <span class="words-of-jesus">“What do you think? If a man has one hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, doesn’t he leave the ninety-nine, go to the mountains, and seek that which has gone astray? </span> <sup>13</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">If he finds it, most certainly I tell you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray. </span> <sup>14</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.</span></p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    <span class="words-of-jesus">“If your brother sins against you, go, show him his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained back your brother. </span> <sup>16</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">But if he doesn’t listen, take one or two more with you, that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</span><sup><a href="#footnote-90" id="ref-90">†</a></sup> <sup>17</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the assembly. If he refuses to hear the assembly also, let him be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector. </span> <sup>18</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Most certainly I tell you, whatever things you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever things you release on earth will have been released in heaven. </span> <sup>19</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Again, assuredly I tell you, that if two of you will agree on earth concerning anything that they will ask, it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven. </span> <sup>20</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there I am in the middle of them.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    Then Peter came and said to him, “Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until seven times?”</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    Jesus said to him, <span class="words-of-jesus">“I don’t tell you until seven times, but, until seventy times seven. </span> <sup>23</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Therefore the Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. </span> <sup>24</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">When he had begun to settle, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.</span><sup><a href="#footnote-91" id="ref-91">†</a></sup> <sup>25</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">But because he couldn’t pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, with his wife, his children, and all that he had, and payment to be made. </span> <sup>26</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">The servant therefore fell down and knelt before him, saying, ‘Lord, have patience with me, and I will repay you all!’ </span> <sup>27</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">The lord of that servant, being moved with compassion, released him and forgave him the debt.</span></p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>
    <span class="words-of-jesus">“But that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him one hundred denarii,</span>

    <span class="words-of-jesus">“So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I will repay you!’ </span> <sup>30</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">He would not, but went and cast him into prison until he should pay back that which was due. </span> <sup>31</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">So when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were exceedingly sorry, and came and told their lord all that was done. </span> <sup>32</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Then his lord called him in and said to him, ‘You wicked servant!

    <sup>1</sup>
    When Jesus had finished these words, he departed from Galilee and came into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan. <sup>2</sup>Great multitudes followed him, and he healed them there.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    Pharisees came to him, testing him and saying, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?”</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    He answered, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Haven’t you read that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female,</span><sup><a href="#footnote-93" id="ref-93">†</a></sup> <sup>5</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">and said, ‘For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh’?</span><sup><a href="#footnote-94" id="ref-94">†</a></sup> <sup>6</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">So that they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, don’t let man tear apart.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    They asked him, “Why then did Moses command us to give her a certificate of divorce and divorce her?”</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    He said to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it has not been so. </span> <sup>9</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">I tell you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and he who marries her when she is divorced commits adultery.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    His disciples said to him, “If this is the case of the man with his wife, it is not expedient to marry.”</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    But he said to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Not all men can receive this saying, but those to whom it is given. </span> <sup>12</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven’s sake. He who is able to receive it, let him receive it.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    Then little children were brought to him that he should lay his hands on them and pray; and the disciples rebuked them. <sup>14</sup>But Jesus said, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Allow the little children, and don’t forbid them to come to me; for the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to ones like these.”</span> <sup>15</sup>He laid his hands on them, and departed from there.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    Behold, one came to him and said, “Good teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?”</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    He said to him, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Why do you call me good?</span><sup><a href="#footnote-95" id="ref-95">†</a></sup> <span class="words-of-jesus">No one is good but one, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.” </span></p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    He said to him, “Which ones?”</p><p>
    Jesus said, <span class="words-of-jesus">“‘You shall not murder.’ ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ ‘You shall not steal.’ ‘You shall not offer false testimony.’ </span> <sup>19</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">‘Honor your father and your mother.’</span><sup><a href="#footnote-96" id="ref-96">†</a></sup> <span class="words-of-jesus">And, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’”</span><sup><a href="#footnote-97" id="ref-97">†</a></sup></p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    The young man said to him, “All these things I have observed from my youth. What do I still lack?”</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    Jesus said to him, <span class="words-of-jesus">“If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.”</span> <sup>22</sup>But when the young man heard this, he went away sad, for he was one who had great possessions.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    Jesus said to his disciples, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Most certainly I say to you, a rich man will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven with difficulty. </span> <sup>24</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to enter into God’s Kingdom.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    When the disciples heard it, they were exceedingly astonished, saying, “Who then can be saved?”</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    Looking at them, Jesus said, <span class="words-of-jesus">“With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>
    Then Peter answered, “Behold, we have left everything and followed you. What then will we have?”</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>
    Jesus said to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Most certainly I tell you that you who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on the throne of his glory, you also will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. </span> <sup>29</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, will receive one hundred times, and will inherit eternal life. </span> <sup>30</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">But many will be last who are first, and first who are last. </span></p><a href="#Matthew-c-20"><h3 id="Matthew-c-20">20</h3></a>

    <span class="words-of-jesus">“For the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who was the master of a household, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard. </span> <sup>2</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">When he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius</span><sup><a href="#footnote-98" id="ref-98">†</a></sup> <span class="words-of-jesus">a day, he sent them into his vineyard. </span> <sup>3</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">He went out about the third hour,</span><sup><a href="#footnote-99" id="ref-99">†</a></sup> <span class="words-of-jesus">and saw others standing idle in the marketplace. </span> <sup>4</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">He said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.’ So they went their way. </span> <sup>5</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour,</span><sup><a href="#footnote-100" id="ref-100">†</a></sup> <span class="words-of-jesus">and did likewise. </span> <sup>6</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">About the eleventh hour</span><sup><a href="#footnote-101" id="ref-101">†</a></sup> <span class="words-of-jesus">he went out and found others standing idle.

    <sup>7</sup>
    <span class="words-of-jesus">“They said to him, ‘Because no one has hired us.’</span></p><p>
    <span class="words-of-jesus">“He said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and you will receive whatever is right.’ </span></p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    <span class="words-of-jesus">“When evening had come, the lord of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning from the last to the first.’</span> <sup>9</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">“When those who were hired at about the eleventh hour came, they each received a denarius. </span> <sup>10</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">When the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise each received a denarius. </span> <sup>11</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">When they received it, they murmured against the master of the household, </span> <sup>12</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">saying, ‘These last have spent one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat!’ </span></p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    <span class="words-of-jesus">“But he answered one of them, ‘Friend, I am doing you no wrong.

    <sup>17</sup>
    As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them, <sup>18</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">“Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death, </span> <sup>19</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">and will hand him over to the Gentiles to mock, to scourge, and to crucify; and the third day he will be raised up.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, kneeling and asking a certain thing of him. <sup>21</sup>He said to her, <span class="words-of-jesus">“What do you want?”</span></p><p>
    She said to him, “Command that these, my two sons, may sit, one on your right hand and one on your left hand, in your Kingdom.”</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    But Jesus answered, <span class="words-of-jesus">“You don’t know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?”</span></p><p>
    They said to him, “We are able.”</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    He said to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“You will indeed drink my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with; but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give, but it is for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    When the ten heard it, they were indignant with the two brothers.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    But Jesus summoned them, and said, <span class="words-of-jesus">“You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. </span> <sup>26</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">It shall not be so among you; but whoever desires to become great among you shall be</span><sup><a href="#footnote-102" id="ref-102">†</a></sup> <span class="words-of-jesus">your servant. </span> <sup>27</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Whoever desires to be first among you shall be your bondservant, </span> <sup>28</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">even as the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>
    As they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him. <sup>30</sup>Behold, two blind men sitting by the road, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, “Lord, have mercy on us, you son of David!” <sup>31</sup>The multitude rebuked them, telling them that they should be quiet, but they cried out even more, “Lord, have mercy on us, you son of David!”</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>
    Jesus stood still and called them, and asked, <span class="words-of-jesus">“What do you want me to do for you?”</span></p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>
    They told him, “Lord, that our eyes may be opened.”</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>
    Jesus, being moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and immediately their eyes received their sight, and they followed him.</p><a href="#Matthew-c-21"><h3 id="Matthew-c-21">21</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    When they came near to Jerusalem and came to Bethsphage,<sup><a href="#footnote-103" id="ref-103">†</a></sup> to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, <sup>2</sup>saying to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Go into the village that is opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me. </span> <sup>3</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, ‘The Lord needs them,’ and immediately he will send them.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    All this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>“Tell the daughter of Zion,</p><p>
    behold, your King comes to you,</p><p>humble, and riding on a donkey,</p><p>
    on a colt, the foal of a donkey.”<sup><a href="#footnote-104" id="ref-104">†</a></sup></p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    The disciples went and did just as Jesus commanded them, <sup>7</sup>and brought the donkey and the colt and laid their clothes on them; and he sat on them. <sup>8</sup>A very great multitude spread their clothes on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. <sup>9</sup>The multitudes who went in front of him, and those who followed, kept shouting, “Hosanna<sup><a href="#footnote-105" id="ref-105">†</a></sup> to the son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!” <sup><a href="#footnote-106" id="ref-106">†</a></sup></p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    When he had come into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred up, saying, “Who is this?”</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    The multitudes said, “This is the prophet, Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee.”</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    Jesus entered into the temple of God and drove out all of those who sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the money changers’ tables and the seats of those who sold the doves. <sup>13</sup>He said to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’</span><sup><a href="#footnote-107" id="ref-107">†</a></sup> <span class="words-of-jesus">but you have made it a den of robbers!”</span><sup><a href="#footnote-108" id="ref-108">†</a></sup></p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    The lame and the blind came to him in the temple, and he healed them. <sup>15</sup>But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children who were crying in the temple and saying, “Hosanna to the son of David!” they were indignant, <sup>16</sup>and said to him, “Do you hear what these are saying?”</p><p>
    Jesus said to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Yes. Did you never read, ‘Out of the mouth of children and nursing babies, you have perfected praise’?”</span><sup><a href="#footnote-109" id="ref-109">†</a></sup></p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    He left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and camped there.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    Now in the morning, as he returned to the city, he was hungry. <sup>19</sup>Seeing a fig tree by the road, he came to it and found nothing on it but leaves. He said to it, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Let there be no fruit from you forever!” </span></p><p>
    Immediately the fig tree withered away.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    When the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, “How did the fig tree immediately wither away?”</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    Jesus answered them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Most certainly I tell you, if you have faith and don’t doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you told this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’ it would be done. </span> <sup>22</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">All things, whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    When he had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, “By what authority do you do these things? Who gave you this authority?”</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    Jesus answered them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“I also will ask you one question, which if you tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things. </span> <sup>25</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">The baptism of John, where was it from? From heaven or from men?” </span></p><p>
    They reasoned with themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask us, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’ <sup>26</sup>But if we say, ‘From men,’ we fear the multitude, for all hold John as a prophet.” <sup>27</sup>They answered Jesus, and said, “We don’t know.”</p><p>
    He also said to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things. </span> <sup>28</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">But what do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the first, and said, ‘Son, go work today in my vineyard.’ </span> <sup>29</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">He answered, ‘I will not,’ but afterward he changed his mind, and went. </span> <sup>30</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">He came to the second, and said the same thing. He answered, ‘I’m going, sir,’ but he didn’t go. </span> <sup>31</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Which of the two did the will of his father?”</span></p><p>
    They said to him, “The first.”</p><p>
    Jesus said to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Most certainly I tell you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering into God’s Kingdom before you. </span> <sup>32</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you didn’t believe him; but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. When you saw it, you didn’t even repent afterward, that you might believe him. </span></p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>
    <span class="words-of-jesus">“Hear another parable. There was a man who was a master of a household who planted a vineyard, set a hedge about it, dug a wine press in it, built a tower, leased it out to farmers, and went into another country. </span> <sup>34</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">When the season for the fruit came near, he sent his servants to the farmers to receive his fruit. </span> <sup>35</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">The farmers took his servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned another. </span> <sup>36</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Again, he sent other servants more than the first; and they treated them the same way. </span> <sup>37</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">But afterward he sent to them his son, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’ </span> <sup>38</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">But the farmers, when they saw the son, said among themselves, ‘This is the heir.

    Jesus answered and spoke to them again in parables, saying, <sup>2</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">“The Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king, who made a wedding feast for his son, </span> <sup>3</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they would not come. </span> <sup>4</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Again he sent out other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who are invited, “Behold, I have prepared my dinner.

    <sup>8</sup>
    <span class="words-of-jesus">“Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding is ready, but those who were invited weren’t worthy. </span> <sup>9</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Go therefore to the intersections of the highways, and as many as you may find, invite to the wedding feast.’ </span> <sup>10</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Those servants went out into the highways and gathered together as many as they found, both bad and good. The wedding was filled with guests. </span></p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    <span class="words-of-jesus">“But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who didn’t have on wedding clothing, </span> <sup>12</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">and he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you come in here not wearing wedding clothing?’ He was speechless. </span> <sup>13</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Then the king said to the servants, ‘Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and throw him into the outer darkness. That is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be.’ </span> <sup>14</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">For many are called, but few chosen.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might entrap him in his talk. <sup>16</sup>They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are honest, and teach the way of God in truth, no matter whom you teach; for you aren’t partial to anyone. <sup>17</sup>Tell us therefore, what do you think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?”</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Why do you test me, you hypocrites? </span> <sup>19</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Show me the tax money.”</span></p><p>
    They brought to him a denarius.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    He asked them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Whose is this image and inscription?”</span></p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    They said to him, “Caesar’s.”</p><p>
    Then he said to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Give therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    When they heard it, they marveled, and left him and went away.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    On that day Sadducees (those who say that there is no resurrection) came to him. They asked him, <sup>24</sup>saying, “Teacher, Moses said, ‘If a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife and raise up offspring<sup><a href="#footnote-111" id="ref-111">†</a></sup> for his brother.’ <sup>25</sup>Now there were with us seven brothers. The first married and died, and having no offspring left his wife to his brother. <sup>26</sup>In the same way, the second also, and the third, to the seventh. <sup>27</sup>After them all, the woman died. <sup>28</sup>In the resurrection therefore, whose wife will she be of the seven? For they all had her.”</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>
    But Jesus answered them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God. </span> <sup>30</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like God’s angels in heaven. </span> <sup>31</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">But concerning the resurrection of the dead, haven’t you read that which was spoken to you by God, saying, </span> <sup>32</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’?</span><sup><a href="#footnote-112" id="ref-112">†</a></sup> <span class="words-of-jesus">God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.”</span></p><p>

    When the multitudes heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>
    But the Pharisees, when they heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, gathered themselves together. <sup>35</sup>One of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, testing him. <sup>36</sup>“Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?”</p><p>
    <sup>37</sup>
    Jesus said to him, <span class="words-of-jesus">“‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’</span><sup><a href="#footnote-113" id="ref-113">†</a></sup> <sup>38</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">This is the first and great commandment. </span> <sup>39</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">A second likewise is this, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’</span><sup><a href="#footnote-114" id="ref-114">†</a></sup> <sup>40</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">The whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments.” </span></p><p>

    They said to him, “Of David.”</p><p>

    Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, <sup>7</sup>a woman came to him having an alabaster jar of very expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head as he sat at the table. <sup>8</sup>But when his disciples saw this, they were indignant, saying, “Why this waste? <sup>9</sup>For this ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor.”</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    However, knowing this, Jesus said to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Why do you trouble the woman? She has done a good work for me. </span> <sup>11</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">For you always have the poor with you, but you don’t always have me. </span> <sup>12</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">For in pouring this ointment on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial. </span> <sup>13</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Most certainly I tell you, wherever this Good News is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of her.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests <sup>15</sup>and said, “What are you willing to give me if I deliver him to you?” So they weighed out for him thirty pieces of silver. <sup>16</sup>From that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    Now on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, “Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?”</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    He said, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Go into the city to a certain person, and tell him, ‘The Teacher says, “My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.”’”</span></p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    The disciples did as Jesus commanded them, and they prepared the Passover.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    Now when evening had come, he was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples. <sup>21</sup>As they were eating, he said, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    They were exceedingly sorrowful, and each began to ask him, “It isn’t me, is it, Lord?”</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    He answered, <span class="words-of-jesus">“He who dipped his hand with me in the dish will betray me. </span> <sup>24</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">The Son of Man goes even as it is written of him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    Judas, who betrayed him, answered, “It isn’t me, is it, Rabbi?”</p><p>
    He said to him, <span class="words-of-jesus">“You said it.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    As they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks for<sup><a href="#footnote-136" id="ref-136">†</a></sup> it, and broke it. He gave to the disciples and said, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Take, eat; this is my body.”</span> <sup>27</sup>He took the cup, gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, <span class="words-of-jesus">“All of you drink it, </span> <sup>28</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">for this is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the remission of sins. </span> <sup>29</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">But I tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father’s Kingdom.” </span></p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>
    When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>
    Then Jesus said to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’</span><sup><a href="#footnote-137" id="ref-137">†</a></sup> <sup>32</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.” </span></p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>
    But Peter answered him, “Even if all will be made to stumble because of you, I will never be made to stumble.”</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>
    Jesus said to him, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Most certainly I tell you that tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>
    Peter said to him, “Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you.” All of the disciples also said likewise.</p><p>
    <sup>36</sup>
    Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Sit here, while I go there and pray.”</span> <sup>37</sup>He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and severely troubled. <sup>38</sup>Then Jesus said to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and watch with me.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>39</sup>
    He went forward a little, fell on his face, and prayed, saying, <span class="words-of-jesus">“My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me; nevertheless, not what I desire, but what you desire.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>40</sup>
    He came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, <span class="words-of-jesus">“What, couldn’t you watch with me for one hour? </span> <sup>41</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Watch and pray, that you don’t enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>42</sup>
    Again, a second time he went away and prayed, saying, <span class="words-of-jesus">“My Father, if this cup can’t pass away from me unless I drink it, your desire be done.” </span></p><p>
    <sup>43</sup>
    He came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. <sup>44</sup>He left them again, went away, and prayed a third time, saying the same words. <sup>45</sup>Then he came to his disciples and said to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. </span> <sup>46</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Arise, let’s be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.” </span></p><p>
    <sup>47</sup>
    While he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people. <sup>48</sup>Now he who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, “Whoever I kiss, he is the one. Seize him.” <sup>49</sup>Immediately he came to Jesus, and said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed him.</p><p>
    <sup>50</sup>
    Jesus said to him, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Friend, why are you here?”</span></p><p>
    Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him. <sup>51</sup>Behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</p><p>
    <sup>52</sup>
    Then Jesus said to him, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Put your sword back into its place, for all those who take the sword will die by the sword. </span> <sup>53</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Or do you think that I couldn’t ask my Father, and he would even now send me more than twelve legions of angels? </span> <sup>54</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?” </span></p><p>
    <sup>55</sup>
    In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you didn’t arrest me. </span> <sup>56</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">But all this has happened that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.”</span></p><p>
    Then all the disciples left him and fled.</p><p>
    <sup>57</sup>
    Those who had taken Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together. <sup>58</sup>But Peter followed him from a distance to the court of the high priest, and entered in and sat with the officers, to see the end.</p><p>
    <sup>59</sup>
    Now the chief priests, the elders, and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus, that they might put him to death, <sup>60</sup>and they found none. Even though many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last two false witnesses came forward <sup>61</sup>and said, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.’”</p><p>
    <sup>62</sup>
    The high priest stood up and said to him, “Have you no answer? What is this that these testify against you?” <sup>63</sup>But Jesus stayed silent. The high priest answered him, “I adjure you by the living God that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.”</p><p>
    <sup>64</sup>
    Jesus said to him, <span class="words-of-jesus">“You have said so. Nevertheless, I tell you, after this you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of the sky.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>65</sup>
    Then the high priest tore his clothing, saying, “He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy. <sup>66</sup>What do you think?”</p><p>
    They answered, “He is worthy of death!” <sup>67</sup>Then they spat in his face and beat him with their fists, and some slapped him, <sup>68</sup>saying, “Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who hit you?”</p><p>
    <sup>69</sup>
    Now Peter was sitting outside in the court, and a maid came to him, saying, “You were also with Jesus, the Galilean!”</p><p>
    <sup>70</sup>
    But he denied it before them all, saying, “I don’t know what you are talking about.”</p><p>
    <sup>71</sup>
    When he had gone out onto the porch, someone else saw him and said to those who were there, “This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.”</p><p>
    <sup>72</sup>
    Again he denied it with an oath, “I don’t know the man.”</p><p>
    <sup>73</sup>
    After a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter, “Surely you are also one of them, for your speech makes you known.”</p><p>
    <sup>74</sup>
    Then he began to curse and to swear, “I don’t know the man!”</p><p>
    Immediately the rooster crowed. <sup>75</sup>Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said to him, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”</span> Then he went out and wept bitterly.</p><a href="#Matthew-c-27"><h3 id="Matthew-c-27">27</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death. <sup>2</sup>They bound him, led him away, and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate, the governor.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that Jesus was condemned, felt remorse, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, <sup>4</sup>saying, “I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood.”</p><p>
    But they said, “What is that to us? You see to it.”</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    He threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary and departed. Then he went away and hanged himself.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    The chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, “It’s not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.” <sup>7</sup>They took counsel, and bought the potter’s field with them to bury strangers in. <sup>8</sup>Therefore that field has been called “The Field of Blood” to this day. <sup>9</sup>Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah<sup><a href="#footnote-138" id="ref-138">†</a></sup> the prophet was fulfilled, saying,</p><p>“They took the thirty pieces of silver,</p><p>
    the price of him upon whom a price had been set,</p><p>
    whom some of the children of Israel priced,</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    and they gave them for the potter’s field,</p><p>
    as the Lord commanded me.”<sup><a href="#footnote-139" id="ref-139">†</a></sup></p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    Now Jesus stood before the governor; and the governor asked him, saying, “Are you the King of the Jews?”</p><p>
    Jesus said to him, <span class="words-of-jesus">“So you say.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    When he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing. <sup>13</sup>Then Pilate said to him, “Don’t you hear how many things they testify against you?”</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    He gave him no answer, not even one word, so that the governor marveled greatly.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner whom they desired. <sup>16</sup>They had then a notable prisoner called Barabbas. <sup>17</sup>When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?” <sup>18</sup>For he knew that because of envy they had delivered him up.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered many things today in a dream because of him.”</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus. <sup>21</sup>But the governor answered them, “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?”</p><p>
    They said, “Barabbas!”</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    Pilate said to them, “What then shall I do to Jesus who is called Christ?”</p><p>
    They all said to him, “Let him be crucified!”</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    But the governor said, “Why? What evil has he done?”</p><p>
    But they cried out exceedingly, saying, “Let him be crucified!”</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    So when Pilate saw that nothing was being gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting, he took water and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, “I am innocent of the blood of this righteous person. You see to it.”</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    All the people answered, “May his blood be on us and on our children!”</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    Then he released Barabbas to them, but Jesus he flogged and delivered to be crucified.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>
    Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered the whole garrison together against him. <sup>28</sup>They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him. <sup>29</sup>They braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him and mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” <sup>30</sup>They spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head. <sup>31</sup>When they had mocked him, they took the robe off him, and put his clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>
    As they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they compelled him to go with them, that he might carry his cross. <sup>33</sup>When they came to a place called “Golgotha”, that is to say, “The place of a skull,” <sup>34</sup>they gave him sour wine<sup><a href="#footnote-140" id="ref-140">†</a></sup> to drink mixed with gall.<sup><a href="#footnote-141" id="ref-141">†</a></sup> When he had tasted it, he would not drink. <sup>35</sup>When they had crucified him, they divided his clothing among them, casting lots,<sup><a href="#footnote-142" id="ref-142">†</a></sup> <sup>36</sup>and they sat and watched him there. <sup>37</sup>They set up over his head the accusation against him written, “THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.”</p><p>
    <sup>38</sup>
    Then there were two robbers crucified with him, one on his right hand and one on the left.</p><p>
    <sup>39</sup>
    Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads <sup>40</sup>and saying, “You who destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!”</p><p>
    <sup>41</sup>
    Likewise the chief priests also mocking with the scribes, the Pharisees,<sup><a href="#footnote-143" id="ref-143">†</a></sup> and the elders, said, <sup>42</sup>“He saved others, but he can’t save himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him. <sup>43</sup>He trusts in God. Let God deliver him now, if he wants him; for he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’” <sup>44</sup>The robbers also who were crucified with him cast on him the same reproach.</p><p>
    <sup>45</sup>
    Now from the sixth hour<sup><a href="#footnote-144" id="ref-144">†</a></sup> there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.<sup><a href="#footnote-145" id="ref-145">†</a></sup> <sup>46</sup>About the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Eli, Eli, lima</span><sup><a href="#footnote-146" id="ref-146">†</a></sup> <span class="words-of-jesus">sabachthani?” </span> That is, <span class="words-of-jesus">“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”</span><sup><a href="#footnote-147" id="ref-147">†</a></sup></p><p>
    <sup>47</sup>
    Some of them who stood there, when they heard it, said, “This man is calling Elijah.”</p><p>
    <sup>48</sup>
    Immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him a drink. <sup>49</sup>The rest said, “Let him be. Let’s see whether Elijah comes to save him.”</p><p>
    <sup>50</sup>
    Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.</p><p>
    <sup>51</sup>
    Behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks were split. <sup>52</sup>The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised; <sup>53</sup>and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many.</p><p>
    <sup>54</sup>
    Now the centurion and those who were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that were done, were terrified, saying, “Truly this was the Son of God!”</p><p>
    <sup>55</sup>
    Many women were there watching from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him. <sup>56</sup>Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</p><p>
    <sup>57</sup>
    When evening had come, a rich man from Arimathaea named Joseph, who himself was also Jesus’ disciple, came. <sup>58</sup>This man went to Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up. <sup>59</sup>Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth <sup>60</sup>and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out in the rock. Then he rolled a large stone against the door of the tomb, and departed. <sup>61</sup>Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.</p><p>
    <sup>62</sup>
    Now on the next day, which was the day after the Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate, <sup>63</sup>saying, “Sir, we remember what that deceiver said while he was still alive: ‘After three days I will rise again.’ <sup>64</sup>Command therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest perhaps his disciples come at night and steal him away, and tell the people, ‘He is risen from the dead;’ and the last deception will be worse than the first.”</p><p>
    <sup>65</sup>
    Pilate said to them, “You have a guard. Go, make it as secure as you can.” <sup>66</sup>So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone.</p><a href="#Matthew-c-28"><h3 id="Matthew-c-28">28</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb. <sup>2</sup>Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky and came and rolled away the stone from the door and sat on it. <sup>3</sup>His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. <sup>4</sup>For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men. <sup>5</sup>The angel answered the women, “Don’t be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified. <sup>6</sup>He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying. <sup>7</sup>Go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.’ Behold, I have told you.”</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word. <sup>9</sup>As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Rejoice!”</span></p><p>
    They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    Then Jesus said to them, <span class="words-of-jesus">“Don’t be afraid. Go tell my brothers </span><sup><a href="#footnote-148" id="ref-148">†</a></sup> <span class="words-of-jesus">that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see me.”</span></p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    Now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city and told the chief priests all the things that had happened. <sup>12</sup>When they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers, <sup>13</sup>saying, “Say that his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept. <sup>14</sup>If this comes to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry.” <sup>15</sup>So they took the money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continues until today.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had sent them. <sup>17</sup>When they saw him, they bowed down to him; but some doubted. <sup>18</sup>Jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying, <span class="words-of-jesus">“All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth. </span> <sup>19</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">Go</span><sup><a href="#footnote-149" id="ref-149">†</a></sup> <span class="words-of-jesus">and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, </span> <sup>20</sup><span class="words-of-jesus">teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.”</span> Amen.</p><a href="#Matthew-h">^</a> <a href="#Matthew-c-1">[1]</a> <a href="#Matthew-c-2">[2]</a> <a href="#Matthew-c-3">[3]</a> <a href="#Matthew-c-4">[4]</a> <a href="#Matthew-c-5">[5]</a> <a href="#Matthew-c-6">[6]</a> <a href="#Matthew-c-7">[7]</a> <a href="#Matthew-c-8">[8]</a> <a href="#Matthew-c-9">[9]</a> <a href="#Matthew-c-10">[10]</a> <a href="#Matthew-c-11">[11]</a> <a href="#Matthew-c-12">[12]</a> <a href="#Matthew-c-13">[13]</a> <a href="#Matthew-c-14">[14]</a> <a href="#Matthew-c-15">[15]</a> <a href="#Matthew-c-16">[16]</a> <a href="#Matthew-c-17">[17]</a> <a href="#Matthew-c-18">[18]</a> <a href="#Matthew-c-19">[19]</a> <a href="#Matthew-c-20">[20]</a> <a href="#Matthew-c-21">[21]</a> <a href="#Matthew-c-22">[22]</a> <a href="#Matthew-c-23">[23]</a> <a href="#Matthew-c-24">[24]</a> <a href="#Matthew-c-25">[25]</a> <a href="#Matthew-c-26">[26]</a> <a href="#Matthew-c-27">[27]</a> <a href="#Matthew-c-28">[28]</a>
