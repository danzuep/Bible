    <sup>1</sup>
    The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel:</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    to know wisdom and instruction;</p><p>
    to discern the words of understanding;</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    to receive instruction in wise dealing,</p><p>
    in righteousness, justice, and equity;</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    to give prudence to the simple,</p><p>
    knowledge and discretion to the young man—</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    that the wise man may hear, and increase in learning;</p><p>
    that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel;</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    to understand a proverb and parables,</p><p>
    the words and riddles of the wise.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    The fear of the LORD<sup><a href="#footnote-0" id="ref-0">†</a></sup> is the beginning of knowledge,</p><p>
    but the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    My son, listen to your father’s instruction,</p><p>
    and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching;</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    for they will be a garland to grace your head,</p><p>
    and chains around your neck.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>My son, if sinners entice you,</p><p>don’t consent.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>If they say, “Come with us.</p><p>
    Let’s lie in wait for blood.</p><p>
    Let’s lurk secretly for the innocent without cause.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    Let’s swallow them up alive like Sheol,<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="ref-1">†</a></sup></p><p>
    and whole, like those who go down into the pit.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    We’ll find all valuable wealth.</p><p>
    We’ll fill our houses with plunder.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    You shall cast your lot amongst us.</p><p>
    We’ll all have one purse”—</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    my son, don’t walk on the path with them.</p><p>
    Keep your foot from their path,</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    for their feet run to evil.</p><p>
    They hurry to shed blood.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    For the net is spread in vain in the sight of any bird;</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    but these lay in wait for their own blood.</p><p>
    They lurk secretly for their own lives.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain.</p><p>
    It takes away the life of its owners.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    Wisdom calls aloud in the street.</p><p>She utters her voice in the public squares.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    She calls at the head of noisy places.</p><p>
    At the entrance of the city gates, she utters her words:</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>“How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity?</p><p>
    How long will mockers delight themselves in mockery,</p><p>
    and fools hate knowledge?</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    Turn at my reproof.</p><p>
    Behold,<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="ref-2">†</a></sup> I will pour out my spirit on you.</p><p>
    I will make known my words to you.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    Because I have called, and you have refused;</p><p>
    I have stretched out my hand, and no one has paid attention;</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    but you have ignored all my counsel,</p><p>
    and wanted none of my reproof;</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    I also will laugh at your disaster.</p><p>
    I will mock when calamity overtakes you,</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>
    when calamity overtakes you like a storm,</p><p>
    when your disaster comes on like a whirlwind,</p><p>
    when distress and anguish come on you.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>
    Then they will call on me, but I will not answer.</p><p>
    They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me,</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>
    because they hated knowledge,</p><p>
    and didn’t choose the fear of the LORD.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>
    They wanted none of my counsel.</p><p>
    They despised all my reproof.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>
    Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way,</p><p>
    and be filled with their own schemes.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>
    For the backsliding of the simple will kill them.</p><p>
    The careless ease of fools will destroy them.</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>
    But whoever listens to me will dwell securely,</p><p>
    and will be at ease, without fear of harm.”</p><a href="#Proverbs-c-2"><h3 id="Proverbs-c-2">2</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    My son, if you will receive my words,</p><p>
    and store up my commandments within you,</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>so as to turn your ear to wisdom,</p><p>
    and apply your heart to understanding;</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    yes, if you call out for discernment,</p><p>
    and lift up your voice for understanding;</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>if you seek her as silver,</p><p>
    and search for her as for hidden treasures;</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    then you will understand the fear of the LORD,</p><p>
    and find the knowledge of God.<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="ref-3">†</a></sup></p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    For the LORD gives wisdom.</p><p>
    Out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    He lays up sound wisdom for the upright.</p><p>
    He is a shield to those who walk in integrity,</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    that he may guard the paths of justice,</p><p>
    and preserve the way of his saints.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    Then you will understand righteousness and justice,</p><p>
    equity and every good path.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    For wisdom will enter into your heart.</p><p>
    Knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    Discretion will watch over you.</p><p>
    Understanding will keep you,</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    to deliver you from the way of evil,</p><p>
    from the men who speak perverse things,</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>who forsake the paths of uprightness,</p><p>
    to walk in the ways of darkness,</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    who rejoice to do evil,</p><p>
    and delight in the perverseness of evil,</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    who are crooked in their ways,</p><p>
    and wayward in their paths,</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    to deliver you from the strange woman,</p><p>even from the foreigner who flatters with her words,</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    who forsakes the friend of her youth,</p><p>
    and forgets the covenant of her God;</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    for her house leads down to death,</p><p>
    her paths to the departed spirits.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    None who go to her return again,</p><p>
    neither do they attain to the paths of life.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    Therefore walk in the way of good men,</p><p>
    and keep the paths of the righteous.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    For the upright will dwell in the land.</p><p>
    The perfect will remain in it.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    But the wicked will be cut off from the land.</p><p>
    The treacherous will be rooted out of it.</p><a href="#Proverbs-c-3"><h3 id="Proverbs-c-3">3</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    My son, don’t forget my teaching,</p><p>
    but let your heart keep my commandments,</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    for they will add to you length of days,</p><p>
    years of life, and peace.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Don’t let kindness and truth forsake you.</p><p>
    Bind them around your neck.</p><p>
    Write them on the tablet of your heart.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    So you will find favour,</p><p>
    and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Trust in the LORD with all your heart,</p><p>
    and don’t lean on your own understanding.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    In all your ways acknowledge him,</p><p>
    and he will make your paths straight.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Don’t be wise in your own eyes.</p><p>
    Fear the LORD, and depart from evil.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    It will be health to your body,</p><p>
    and nourishment to your bones.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    Honour the LORD with your substance,</p><p>
    with the first fruits of all your increase;</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>so your barns will be filled with plenty,</p><p>
    and your vats will overflow with new wine.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    My son, don’t despise the LORD’s discipline,</p><p>neither be weary of his correction;</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    for whom the LORD loves, he corrects,</p><p>
    even as a father reproves the son in whom he delights.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Happy is the man who finds wisdom,</p><p>
    the man who gets understanding.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    For her good profit is better than getting silver,</p><p>
    and her return is better than fine gold.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    She is more precious than rubies.</p><p>
    None of the things you can desire are to be compared to her.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    Length of days is in her right hand.</p><p>
    In her left hand are riches and honour.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    Her ways are ways of pleasantness.</p><p>
    All her paths are peace.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her.</p><p>Happy is everyone who retains her.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    By wisdom the LORD founded the earth.</p><p>
    By understanding, he established the heavens.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    By his knowledge, the depths were broken up,</p><p>
    and the skies drop down the dew.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    My son, let them not depart from your eyes.</p><p>
    Keep sound wisdom and discretion,</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    so they will be life to your soul,</p><p>
    and grace for your neck.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    Then you shall walk in your way securely.</p><p>
    Your foot won’t stumble.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    When you lie down, you will not be afraid.</p><p>Yes, you will lie down, and your sleep will be sweet.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>Don’t be afraid of sudden fear,</p><p>neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes;</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    for the LORD will be your confidence,</p><p>
    and will keep your foot from being taken.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>Don’t withhold good from those to whom it is due,</p><p>
    when it is in the power of your hand to do it.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>Don’t say to your neighbour, “Go, and come again;</p><p>
    tomorrow I will give it to you,”</p><p>
    when you have it by you.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>Don’t devise evil against your neighbour,</p><p>since he dwells securely by you.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>Don’t strive with a man without cause,</p><p>if he has done you no harm.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>Don’t envy the man of violence.</p><p>Choose none of his ways.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>
    For the perverse is an abomination to the LORD,</p><p>
    but his friendship is with the upright.</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>
    The LORD’s curse is in the house of the wicked,</p><p>
    but he blesses the habitation of the righteous.</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>
    Surely he mocks the mockers,</p><p>
    but he gives grace to the humble.</p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>
    The wise will inherit glory,</p><p>but shame will be the promotion of fools.</p><a href="#Proverbs-c-4"><h3 id="Proverbs-c-4">4</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Listen, sons, to a father’s instruction.</p><p>
    Pay attention and know understanding;</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    for I give you sound learning.</p><p>Don’t forsake my law.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    For I was a son to my father,</p><p>
    tender and an only child in the sight of my mother.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    He taught me, and said to me:</p><p>“Let your heart retain my words.</p><p>
    Keep my commandments, and live.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Get wisdom.</p><p>
    Get understanding.</p><p>Don’t forget, and don’t deviate from the words of my mouth.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Don’t forsake her, and she will preserve you.</p><p>Love her, and she will keep you.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    Wisdom is supreme.</p><p>
    Get wisdom.</p><p>Yes, though it costs all your possessions, get understanding.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    Esteem her, and she will exalt you.</p><p>
    She will bring you to honour when you embrace her.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>She will give to your head a garland of grace.</p><p>She will deliver a crown of splendour to you.”</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    Listen, my son, and receive my sayings.</p><p>
    The years of your life will be many.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    I have taught you in the way of wisdom.</p><p>
    I have led you in straight paths.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>When you go, your steps will not be hampered.</p><p>When you run, you will not stumble.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    Take firm hold of instruction.</p><p>Don’t let her go.</p><p>
    Keep her, for she is your life.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>Don’t enter into the path of the wicked.</p><p>Don’t walk in the way of evil men.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    Avoid it, and don’t pass by it.</p><p>
    Turn from it, and pass on.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    For they don’t sleep unless they do evil.</p><p>
    Their sleep is taken away, unless they make someone fall.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    For they eat the bread of wickedness</p><p>
    and drink the wine of violence.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    But the path of the righteous is like the dawning light</p><p>
    that shines more and more until the perfect day.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    The way of the wicked is like darkness.</p><p>
    They don’t know what they stumble over.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    My son, attend to my words.</p><p>
    Turn your ear to my sayings.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    Let them not depart from your eyes.</p><p>
    Keep them in the centre of your heart.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    For they are life to those who find them,</p><p>
    and health to their whole body.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    Keep your heart with all diligence,</p><p>
    for out of it is the wellspring of life.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    Put away from yourself a perverse mouth.</p><p>
    Put corrupt lips far from you.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    Let your eyes look straight ahead.</p><p>Fix your gaze directly before you.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    Make the path of your feet level.</p><p>Let all of your ways be established.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>Don’t turn to the right hand nor to the left.</p><p>
    Remove your foot from evil.</p><a href="#Proverbs-c-5"><h3 id="Proverbs-c-5">5</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    My son, pay attention to my wisdom.</p><p>
    Turn your ear to my understanding,</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    that you may maintain discretion,</p><p>
    that your lips may preserve knowledge.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    For the lips of an adulteress drip honey.</p><p>
    Her mouth is smoother than oil,</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>but in the end she is as bitter as wormwood,</p><p>
    and as sharp as a two-edged sword.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Her feet go down to death.</p><p>
    Her steps lead straight to Sheol.<sup><a href="#footnote-4" id="ref-4">†</a></sup></p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    She gives no thought to the way of life.</p><p>
    Her ways are crooked, and she doesn’t know it.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    Now therefore, my sons, listen to me.</p><p>Don’t depart from the words of my mouth.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    Remove your way far from her.</p><p>Don’t come near the door of her house,</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    lest you give your honour to others,</p><p>
    and your years to the cruel one;</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    lest strangers feast on your wealth,</p><p>
    and your labours enrich another man’s house.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    You will groan at your latter end,</p><p>
    when your flesh and your body are consumed,</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    and say, “How I have hated instruction,</p><p>
    and my heart despised reproof.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    I haven’t obeyed the voice of my teachers,</p><p>
    nor turned my ear to those who instructed me!</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    I have come to the brink of utter ruin,</p><p>
    amongst the gathered assembly.”</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    Drink water out of your own cistern,</p><p>running water out of your own well.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>Should your springs overflow in the streets,</p><p>
    streams of water in the public squares?</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    Let them be for yourself alone,</p><p>
    not for strangers with you.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    Let your spring be blessed.</p><p>
    Rejoice in the wife of your youth.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    A loving doe and a graceful deer—</p><p>
    let her breasts satisfy you at all times.</p><p>
    Be captivated always with her love.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    For why should you, my son, be captivated with an adulteress?</p><p>
    Why embrace the bosom of another?</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    For the ways of man are before the LORD’s eyes.</p><p>
    He examines all his paths.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare him.</p><p>
    The cords of his sin hold him firmly.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    He will die for lack of instruction.</p><p>
    In the greatness of his folly, he will go astray.</p><a href="#Proverbs-c-6"><h3 id="Proverbs-c-6">6</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>My son, if you have become collateral for your neighbour,</p><p>
    if you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger,</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    you are trapped by the words of your mouth;</p><p>
    you are ensnared with the words of your mouth.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself,</p><p>
    since you have come into the hand of your neighbour.</p><p>
    Go, humble yourself.</p><p>Press your plea with your neighbour.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    Give no sleep to your eyes,</p><p>nor slumber to your eyelids.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter,</p><p>like a bird from the snare of the fowler.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    Go to the ant, you sluggard.</p><p>
    Consider her ways, and be wise;</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>which having no chief, overseer, or ruler,</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    provides her bread in the summer,</p><p>
    and gathers her food in the harvest.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    How long will you sleep, sluggard?</p><p>
    When will you arise out of your sleep?</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    A little sleep, a little slumber,</p><p>
    a little folding of the hands to sleep—</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    so your poverty will come as a robber,</p><p>
    and your scarcity as an armed man.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    A worthless person, a man of iniquity,</p><p>
    is he who walks with a perverse mouth,</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet,</p><p>who motions with his fingers,</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    in whose heart is perverseness,</p><p>
    who devises evil continually,</p><p>
    who always sows discord.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    Therefore his calamity will come suddenly.</p><p>
    He will be broken suddenly, and that without remedy.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    There are six things which the LORD hates;</p><p>yes, seven which are an abomination to him:</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>arrogant eyes, a lying tongue,</p><p>
    hands that shed innocent blood,</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    a heart that devises wicked schemes,</p><p>
    feet that are swift in running to mischief,</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    a false witness who utters lies,</p><p>
    and he who sows discord amongst brothers.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    My son, keep your father’s commandment,</p><p>
    and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    Bind them continually on your heart.</p><p>
    Tie them around your neck.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    When you walk, it will lead you.</p><p>
    When you sleep, it will watch over you.</p><p>
    When you awake, it will talk with you.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    For the commandment is a lamp,</p><p>
    and the law is light.</p><p>
    Reproofs of instruction are the way of life,</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    to keep you from the immoral woman,</p><p>
    from the flattery of the wayward wife’s tongue.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>Don’t lust after her beauty in your heart,</p><p>neither let her captivate you with her eyelids.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    For a prostitute reduces you to a piece of bread.</p><p>
    The adulteress hunts for your precious life.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>
    Can a man scoop fire into his lap,</p><p>
    and his clothes not be burnt?</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>
    Or can one walk on hot coals,</p><p>
    and his feet not be scorched?</p><p>

    <sup>3</sup>Through wisdom a house is built;</p><p>
    by understanding it is established;</p><p>

    A wise man has great power.</p><p>

    <sup>7</sup>
    Wisdom is too high for a fool.</p><p>
    He doesn’t open his mouth in the gate.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>One who plots to do evil</p><p>
    will be called a schemer.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    The schemes of folly are sin.</p><p>
    The mocker is detested by men.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>If you falter in the time of trouble,</p><p>
    your strength is small.</p><p>

    Rescue those who are being led away to death!</p><p>Indeed, hold back those who are staggering to the slaughter!</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    If you say, “Behold, we didn’t know this,”</p><p>doesn’t he who weighs the hearts consider it?</p><p>
    He who keeps your soul, doesn’t he know it?</p><p>
    Shall he not give to every man according to his work?</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    My son, eat honey, for it is good,</p><p>
    the droppings of the honeycomb, which are sweet to your taste;</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    so you shall know wisdom to be to your soul.</p><p>
    If you have found it, then there will be a reward:</p><p>
    Your hope will not be cut off.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>Don’t lay in wait, wicked man, against the habitation of the righteous.</p><p>Don’t destroy his resting place;</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    for a righteous man falls seven times and rises up again,</p><p>
    but the wicked are overthrown by calamity.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Don’t rejoice when your enemy falls.</p><p>Don’t let your heart be glad when he is overthrown,</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    lest the LORD see it, and it displease him,</p><p>
    and he turn away his wrath from him.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Don’t fret yourself because of evildoers,</p><p>neither be envious of the wicked;</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    for there will be no reward to the evil man.</p><p>
    The lamp of the wicked will be snuffed out.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    My son, fear the LORD and the king.</p><p>Don’t join those who are rebellious,</p><p>

    for their calamity will rise suddenly.</p><p>
    Who knows what destruction may come from them both?</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    These also are sayings of the wise:</p><p>
    To show partiality in judgement is not good.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    He who says to the wicked, “You are righteous,”</p><p>
    peoples will curse him, and nations will abhor him—</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    but it will go well with those who convict the guilty,</p><p>
    and a rich blessing will come on them.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    An honest answer</p><p>
    is like a kiss on the lips.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>
    Prepare your work outside,</p><p>
    and get your fields ready.</p><p>Afterwards, build your house.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>Don’t be a witness against your neighbour without cause.</p><p>Don’t deceive with your lips.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>Don’t say, “I will do to him as he has done to me;</p><p>
    I will repay the man according to his work.”</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>
    I went by the field of the sluggard,</p><p>
    by the vineyard of the man void of understanding.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>
    Behold, it was all grown over with thorns.</p><p>
    Its surface was covered with nettles,</p><p>
    and its stone wall was broken down.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>
    Then I saw, and considered well.</p><p>
    I saw, and received instruction:</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>
    a little sleep, a little slumber,</p><p>
    a little folding of the hands to sleep,</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>
    so your poverty will come as a robber</p><p>
    and your want as an armed man.</p><a href="#Proverbs-c-25"><h3 id="Proverbs-c-25">25</h3></a>

    <sup>1</sup>
    These also are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>It is the glory of God to conceal a thing,</p><p>
    but the glory of kings is to search out a matter.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    As the heavens for height, and the earth for depth,</p><p>so the hearts of kings are unsearchable.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    Take away the dross from the silver,</p><p>
    and material comes out for the refiner.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Take away the wicked from the king’s presence,</p><p>
    and his throne will be established in righteousness.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Don’t exalt yourself in the presence of the king,</p><p>
    or claim a place amongst great men;</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    for it is better that it be said to you, “Come up here,”</p><p>
    than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince,</p><p>
    whom your eyes have seen.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Don’t be hasty in bringing charges to court.</p><p>
    What will you do in the end when your neighbour shames you?</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    Debate your case with your neighbour,</p><p>
    and don’t betray the confidence of another,</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    lest one who hears it put you to shame,</p><p>
    and your bad reputation never depart.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    A word fitly spoken</p><p>
    is like apples of gold in settings of silver.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold,</p><p>
    so is a wise reprover to an obedient ear.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    As the cold of snow in the time of harvest,</p><p>
    so is a faithful messenger to those who send him;</p><p>
    for he refreshes the soul of his masters.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    As clouds and wind without rain,</p><p>
    so is he who boasts of gifts deceptively.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>By patience a ruler is persuaded.</p><p>
    A soft tongue breaks the bone.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    Have you found honey?</p><p>Eat as much as is sufficient for you,</p><p>
    lest you eat too much, and vomit it.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Let your foot be seldom in your neighbour’s house,</p><p>
    lest he be weary of you, and hate you.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    A man who gives false testimony against his neighbour</p><p>
    is like a club, a sword, or a sharp arrow.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    Confidence in someone unfaithful in time of trouble</p><p>
    is like a bad tooth or a lame foot.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    As one who takes away a garment in cold weather,</p><p>
    or vinegar on soda,</p><p>
    so is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat.</p><p>If he is thirsty, give him water to drink;</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    for you will heap coals of fire on his head,</p><p>
    and the LORD will reward you.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    The north wind produces rain;</p><p>
    so a backbiting tongue brings an angry face.</p><p>

    It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop</p><p>
    than to share a house with a contentious woman.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    Like cold water to a thirsty soul,</p><p>
    so is good news from a far country.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    Like a muddied spring and a polluted well,</p><p>
    so is a righteous man who gives way before the wicked.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>
    It is not good to eat much honey,</p><p>
    nor is it honourable to seek one’s own honour.</p><p>

    so the undeserved curse doesn’t come to rest.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    A whip is for the horse,</p><p>
    a bridle for the donkey,</p><p>
    and a rod for the back of fools!</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Don’t answer a fool according to his folly,</p><p>
    lest you also be like him.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Answer a fool according to his folly,</p><p>
    lest he be wise in his own eyes.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    One who sends a message by the hand of a fool</p><p>
    is cutting off feet and drinking violence.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    Like the legs of the lame that hang loose,</p><p>
    so is a parable in the mouth of fools.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    As one who binds a stone in a sling,</p><p>
    so is he who gives honour to a fool.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    Like a thorn bush that goes into the hand of a drunkard,</p><p>
    so is a parable in the mouth of fools.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    As an archer who wounds all,</p><p>
    so is he who hires a fool</p><p>
    or he who hires those who pass by.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    As a dog that returns to his vomit,</p><p>
    so is a fool who repeats his folly.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    Do you see a man wise in his own eyes?</p><p>
    There is more hope for a fool than for him.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    The sluggard says, “There is a lion in the road!</p><p>
    A fierce lion roams the streets!”</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    As the door turns on its hinges,</p><p>
    so does the sluggard on his bed.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    The sluggard buries his hand in the dish.</p><p>
    He is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes</p><p>
    than seven men who answer with discretion.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    Like one who grabs a dog’s ears</p><p>
    is one who passes by and meddles in a quarrel not his own.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>Like a madman who shoots torches, arrows, and death,</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    is the man who deceives his neighbour and says, “Am I not joking?”</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    For lack of wood a fire goes out.</p><p>Without gossip, a quarrel dies down.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>As coals are to hot embers,</p><p>

    <sup>22</sup>
    The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels,</p><p>
    they go down into the innermost parts.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    Like silver dross on an earthen vessel</p><p>
    are the lips of a fervent one with an evil heart.</p><p>

    A malicious man disguises himself with his lips,</p><p>
    but he harbours evil in his heart.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    When his speech is charming, don’t believe him,</p><p>
    for there are seven abominations in his heart.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    His malice may be concealed by deception,</p><p>

    <sup>27</sup>Whoever digs a pit shall fall into it.</p><p>Whoever rolls a stone, it will come back on him.</p><p>

    The wounds of a friend are faithful,</p><p>although the kisses of an enemy are profuse.</p><p>

    A full soul loathes a honeycomb;</p><p>

    Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart;</p><p>so does earnest counsel from a man’s friend.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Don’t forsake your friend and your father’s friend.</p><p>Don’t go to your brother’s house in the day of your disaster.</p><p>
    A neighbour who is near is better than a distant brother.</p><p>

    Be wise, my son,</p><p>

    A prudent man sees danger and takes refuge;</p><p>
    but the simple pass on, and suffer for it.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    Take his garment when he puts up collateral for a stranger.</p><p>
    Hold it for a wayward woman!</p><p>

    He who blesses his neighbour with a loud voice early in the morning,</p><p>

    <sup>15</sup>
    A continual dropping on a rainy day</p><p>

    <sup>24</sup>Whoever is an accomplice of a thief is an enemy of his own soul.</p><p>
    He takes an oath, but dares not testify.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    The fear of man proves to be a snare,</p><p>
    but whoever puts his trust in the LORD is kept safe.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    Many seek the ruler’s favour,</p><p>
    but a man’s justice comes from the LORD.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>
    A dishonest man detests the righteous,</p><p>
    and the upright in their ways detest the wicked.</p><a href="#Proverbs-c-30"><h3 id="Proverbs-c-30">30</h3></a>

    <sup>1</sup>
    The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, the revelation:</p><p>
    the man says to Ithiel,</p><p>
    to Ithiel and Ucal:</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>“Surely I am the most ignorant man,</p><p>
    and don’t have a man’s understanding.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    I have not learnt wisdom,</p><p>
    neither do I have the knowledge of the Holy One.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    Who has ascended up into heaven, and descended?</p><p>
    Who has gathered the wind in his fists?</p><p>
    Who has bound the waters in his garment?</p><p>
    Who has established all the ends of the earth?</p><p>
    What is his name, and what is his son’s name, if you know?</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>“Every word of God is flawless.</p><p>
    He is a shield to those who take refuge in him.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Don’t you add to his words,</p><p>
    lest he reprove you, and you be found a liar.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>“Two things I have asked of you.</p><p>Don’t deny me before I die.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    Remove far from me falsehood and lies.</p><p>
    Give me neither poverty nor riches.</p><p>
    Feed me with the food that is needful for me,</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    lest I be full, deny you, and say, ‘Who is the LORD?’</p><p>
    or lest I be poor, and steal,</p><p>
    and so dishonour the name of my God.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>“Don’t slander a servant to his master,</p><p>
    lest he curse you, and you be held guilty.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>There is a generation that curses their father,</p><p>
    and doesn’t bless their mother.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>There is a generation that is pure in their own eyes,</p><p>
    yet are not washed from their filthiness.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>There is a generation, oh how lofty are their eyes!</p><p>
    Their eyelids are lifted up.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>There is a generation whose teeth are like swords,</p><p>
    and their jaws like knives,</p><p>
    to devour the poor from the earth, and the needy from amongst men.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>“The leech has two daughters:</p><p>‘Give, give.’</p><p>“There are three things that are never satisfied;</p><p>
    four that don’t say, ‘Enough!’:</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    Sheol,<sup><a href="#footnote-12" id="ref-12">†</a></sup></p><p>
    the barren womb,</p><p>
    the earth that is not satisfied with water,</p><p>
    and the fire that doesn’t say, ‘Enough!’</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>“The eye that mocks at his father,</p><p>
    and scorns obedience to his mother,</p><p>
    the ravens of the valley shall pick it out,</p><p>
    the young eagles shall eat it.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>“There are three things which are too amazing for me,</p><p>
    four which I don’t understand:</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    The way of an eagle in the air,</p><p>
    the way of a serpent on a rock,</p><p>
    the way of a ship in the middle of the sea,</p><p>
    and the way of a man with a maiden.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>“So is the way of an adulterous woman:</p><p>
    She eats and wipes her mouth,</p><p>
    and says, ‘I have done nothing wrong.’</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>“For three things the earth trembles,</p><p>
    and under four, it can’t bear up:</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    For a servant when he is king,</p><p>
    a fool when he is filled with food,</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    for an unloved woman when she is married,</p><p>
    and a servant who is heir to her mistress.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>“There are four things which are little on the earth,</p><p>
    but they are exceedingly wise:</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    The ants are not a strong people,</p><p>
    yet they provide their food in the summer.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    The hyraxes are but a feeble folk,</p><p>
    yet make they their houses in the rocks.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>
    The locusts have no king,</p><p>
    yet they advance in ranks.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>
    You can catch a lizard with your hands,</p><p>yet it is in kings’ palaces.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>“There are three things which are stately in their march,</p><p>
    four which are stately in going:</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>
    The lion, which is mightiest amongst animals,</p><p>
    and doesn’t turn away for any;</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>
    the greyhound;</p><p>
    the male goat;</p><p>
    and the king against whom there is no rising up.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>“If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself,</p><p>
    or if you have thought evil,</p><p>
    put your hand over your mouth.</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>
    For as the churning of milk produces butter,</p><p>
    and the wringing of the nose produces blood,</p><p>
    so the forcing of wrath produces strife.”</p><a href="#Proverbs-c-31"><h3 id="Proverbs-c-31">31</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    The words of King Lemuel—the revelation which his mother taught him:</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>“Oh, my son!</p><p>Oh, son of my womb!</p><p>Oh, son of my vows!</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Don’t give your strength to women,</p><p>nor your ways to that which destroys kings.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    It is not for kings, Lemuel,</p><p>
    it is not for kings to drink wine,</p><p>nor for princes to say, ‘Where is strong drink?’</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    lest they drink, and forget the law,</p><p>
    and pervert the justice due to anyone who is afflicted.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    Give strong drink to him who is ready to perish,</p><p>
    and wine to the bitter in soul.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    Let him drink, and forget his poverty,</p><p>
    and remember his misery no more.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    Open your mouth for the mute,</p><p>
    in the cause of all who are left desolate.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    Open your mouth, judge righteously,</p><p>
    and serve justice to the poor and needy.”</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    <sup><a href="#footnote-13" id="ref-13">†</a></sup> Who can find a worthy woman?</p><p>
    For her value is far above rubies.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    The heart of her husband trusts in her.</p><p>
    He shall have no lack of gain.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    She does him good, and not harm,</p><p>
    all the days of her life.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    She seeks wool and flax,</p><p>
    and works eagerly with her hands.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>She is like the merchant ships.</p><p>She brings her bread from afar.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    She rises also while it is yet night,</p><p>
    gives food to her household,</p><p>
    and portions for her servant girls.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    She considers a field, and buys it.</p><p>
    With the fruit of her hands, she plants a vineyard.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>She arms her waist with strength,</p><p>
    and makes her arms strong.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    She perceives that her merchandise is profitable.</p><p>
    Her lamp doesn’t go out by night.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    She lays her hands to the distaff,</p><p>
    and her hands hold the spindle.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    She opens her arms to the poor;</p><p>yes, she extends her hands to the needy.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    She is not afraid of the snow for her household,</p><p>
    for all her household are clothed with scarlet.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>She makes for herself carpets of tapestry.</p><p>
    Her clothing is fine linen and purple.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    Her husband is respected in the gates,</p><p>
    when he sits amongst the elders of the land.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>She makes linen garments and sells them,</p><p>
    and delivers sashes to the merchant.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    Strength and dignity are her clothing.</p><p>She laughs at the time to come.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    She opens her mouth with wisdom.</p><p>Kind instruction is on her tongue.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>
    She looks well to the ways of her household,</p><p>
    and doesn’t eat the bread of idleness.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>
    Her children rise up and call her blessed.</p><p>
    Her husband also praises her:</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>“Many women do noble things,</p><p>
    but you excel them all.”</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>
    Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain;</p><p>
    but a woman who fears the LORD, she shall be praised.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>
    Give her of the fruit of her hands!</p><p>
    Let her works praise her in the gates!</p><a href="#Proverbs-h">^</a> <a href="#Proverbs-c-1">[1]</a> <a href="#Proverbs-c-2">[2]</a> <a href="#Proverbs-c-3">[3]</a> <a href="#Proverbs-c-4">[4]</a> <a href="#Proverbs-c-5">[5]</a> <a href="#Proverbs-c-6">[6]</a> <a href="#Proverbs-c-7">[7]</a> <a href="#Proverbs-c-8">[8]</a> <a href="#Proverbs-c-9">[9]</a> <a href="#Proverbs-c-10">[10]</a> <a href="#Proverbs-c-11">[11]</a> <a href="#Proverbs-c-12">[12]</a> <a href="#Proverbs-c-13">[13]</a> <a href="#Proverbs-c-14">[14]</a> <a href="#Proverbs-c-15">[15]</a> <a href="#Proverbs-c-16">[16]</a> <a href="#Proverbs-c-17">[17]</a> <a href="#Proverbs-c-18">[18]</a> <a href="#Proverbs-c-19">[19]</a> <a href="#Proverbs-c-20">[20]</a> <a href="#Proverbs-c-21">[21]</a> <a href="#Proverbs-c-22">[22]</a> <a href="#Proverbs-c-23">[23]</a> <a href="#Proverbs-c-24">[24]</a> <a href="#Proverbs-c-25">[25]</a> <a href="#Proverbs-c-26">[26]</a> <a href="#Proverbs-c-27">[27]</a> <a href="#Proverbs-c-28">[28]</a> <a href="#Proverbs-c-29">[29]</a> <a href="#Proverbs-c-30">[30]</a> <a href="#Proverbs-c-31">[31]</a>
