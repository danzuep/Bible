    Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ,<sup><a href="#footnote-0" id="ref-0">†</a></sup> according to the faith of God’s chosen ones and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness, <sup>2</sup>in hope of eternal life, which God, who can’t lie, promised before time began; <sup>3</sup>but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Saviour, <sup>4</sup>to Titus, my true child according to a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in order the things that were lacking and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you— <sup>6</sup>if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of loose or unruly behaviour. <sup>7</sup>For the overseer must be blameless, as God’s steward, not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain; <sup>8</sup>but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober minded, fair, holy, self-controlled, <sup>9</sup>holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict those who contradict him.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision, <sup>11</sup>whose mouths must be stopped: men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gain’s sake. <sup>12</sup>One of them, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons.” <sup>13</sup>This testimony is true. For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, <sup>14</sup>not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth. <sup>15</sup>To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled. <sup>16</sup>They profess that they know God, but by their deeds they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work.</p><a href="#Titus-c-2"><h3 id="Titus-c-2">2</h3></a>

    <sup>1</sup>
    But say the things which fit sound doctrine, <sup>2</sup>that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober minded, sound in faith, in love, and in perseverance, <sup>3</sup>and that older women likewise be reverent in behaviour, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good, <sup>4</sup>that they may train the young wives to love their husbands, to love their children, <sup>5</sup>to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that God’s word may not be blasphemed.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober minded. <sup>7</sup>In all things show yourself an example of good works. In your teaching, show integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility, <sup>8</sup>and soundness of speech that can’t be condemned, that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters and to be well-pleasing in all things, not contradicting, <sup>10</sup>not stealing, but showing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God, our Saviour, in all things. <sup>11</sup>For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, <sup>12</sup>instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present age; <sup>13</sup>looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Saviour, Jesus Christ, <sup>14</sup>who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good works.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one despise you.</p><a href="#Titus-c-3"><h3 id="Titus-c-3">3</h3></a>

    <sup>1</sup>
    Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work, <sup>2</sup>to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility towards all men. <sup>3</sup>For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. <sup>4</sup>But when the kindness of God our Saviour and his love towards mankind appeared, <sup>5</sup>not by works of righteousness which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit, <sup>6</sup>whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; <sup>7</sup>that being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. <sup>8</sup>This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you insist confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men; <sup>9</sup>but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain. <sup>10</sup>Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning, <sup>11</sup>knowing that such a one is perverted and sinful, being self-condemned.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there. <sup>13</sup>Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them. <sup>14</sup>Let our people also learn to maintain good works to meet necessary needs, that they may not be unfruitful.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith.</p><p>
    Grace be with you all. Amen.</p><a href="#Titus-h">^</a> <a href="#Titus-c-1">[1]</a> <a href="#Titus-c-2">[2]</a> <a href="#Titus-c-3">[3]</a>
