    <sup>1</sup>
    The elder, to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not I only, but also all those who know the truth, <sup>2</sup>for the truth’s sake, which remains in us, and it will be with us forever: <sup>3</sup>Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ,<sup><a href="#footnote-0" id="ref-0">†</a></sup> the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, even as we have been commanded by the Father. <sup>5</sup>Now I beg you, dear lady, not as though I wrote to you a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another. <sup>6</sup>This is love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who don’t confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist. <sup>8</sup>Watch yourselves, that we don’t lose the things which we have accomplished, but that we receive a full reward. <sup>9</sup>Whoever transgresses and doesn’t remain in the teaching of Christ doesn’t have God. He who remains in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. <sup>10</sup>If anyone comes to you and doesn’t bring this teaching, don’t receive him into your house, and don’t welcome him, <sup>11</sup>for he who welcomes him participates in his evil deeds.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    Having many things to write to you, I don’t want to do so with paper and ink, but I hope to come to you and to speak face to face, that our joy may be made full. <sup>13</sup>The children of your chosen sister greet you. Amen.</p><a href="#2 John-h">^</a> <a href="#2 John-c-1">[1]</a>
