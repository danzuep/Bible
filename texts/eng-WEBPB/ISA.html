<a href="#Isaiah-c-1"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-1">1</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    Hear, heavens,</p><p>
    and listen, earth; for the LORD<sup><a href="#footnote-0" id="ref-0">†</a></sup> has spoken:</p><p>“I have nourished and brought up children</p><p>
    and they have rebelled against me.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    The ox knows his owner,</p><p>
    and the donkey his master’s crib;</p><p>
    but Israel doesn’t know.</p><p>
    My people don’t consider.”</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    Ah sinful nation,</p><p>
    a people loaded with iniquity,</p><p>
    offspring
    <sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="ref-1">†</a></sup> of evildoers,</p><p>
    children who deal corruptly!</p><p>
    They have forsaken the LORD.</p><p>
    They have despised the Holy One of Israel.</p><p>
    They are estranged and backward.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Why should you be beaten more,</p><p>
    that you revolt more and more?</p><p>
    The whole head is sick,</p><p>
    and the whole heart faint.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it,</p><p>
    but wounds, welts, and open sores.</p><p>
    They haven’t been closed, bandaged, or soothed with oil.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    Your country is desolate.</p><p>
    Your cities are burnt with fire.</p><p>
    Strangers devour your land in your presence</p><p>
    and it is desolate,</p><p>
    as overthrown by strangers.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    The daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard,</p><p>
    like a hut in a field of melons,</p><p>
    like a besieged city.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    Unless the LORD of Armies had left to us a very small remnant,</p><p>
    we would have been as Sodom.</p><p>
    We would have been like Gomorrah.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    Hear the LORD’s word, you rulers of Sodom!</p><p>
    Listen to the law of our God,<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="ref-2">†</a></sup> you people of Gomorrah!</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>“What are the multitude of your sacrifices to me?”, says the LORD.</p><p>“I have had enough of the burnt offerings of rams</p><p>
    and the fat of fed animals.</p><p>
    I don’t delight in the blood of bulls,</p><p>
    or of lambs,</p><p>
    or of male goats.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    When you come to appear before me,</p><p>
    who has required this at your hand, to trample my courts?</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    Bring no more vain offerings.</p><p>
    Incense is an abomination to me.</p><p>
    New moons, Sabbaths, and convocations—</p><p>
    I can’t stand evil assemblies.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    My soul hates your New Moons and your appointed feasts.</p><p>
    They are a burden to me.</p><p>
    I am weary of bearing them.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    When you spread out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you.</p><p>
    Yes, when you make many prayers, I will not hear.</p><p>
    Your hands are full of blood.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    Wash yourselves. Make yourself clean.</p><p>
    Put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes.</p><p>
    Cease to do evil.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    Learn to do well.</p><p>
    Seek justice.</p><p>Relieve the oppressed.</p><p>
    Defend the fatherless.</p><p>
    Plead for the widow.”</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>“Come now, and let’s reason together,” says the LORD:</p><p>“Though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.</p><p>Though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>If you are willing and obedient,</p><p>
    you will eat the good of the land;</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    but if you refuse and rebel, you will be devoured with the sword;</p><p>
    for the LORD’s mouth has spoken it.”</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>How the faithful city has become a prostitute!</p><p>She was full of justice.</p><p>
    Righteousness lodged in her,</p><p>
    but now there are murderers.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    Your silver has become dross,</p><p>
    your wine mixed with water.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    Your princes are rebellious and companions of thieves.</p><p>
    Everyone loves bribes and follows after rewards.</p><p>
    They don’t defend the fatherless,</p><p>
    neither does the cause of the widow come to them.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    Therefore the Lord,<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="ref-3">†</a></sup> GOD of Armies,</p><p>
    the Mighty One of Israel, says:</p><p>“Ah, I will get relief from my adversaries,</p><p>
    and avenge myself on my enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    I will turn my hand on you,</p><p>thoroughly purge away your dross,</p><p>
    and will take away all your tin.<sup><a href="#footnote-4" id="ref-4">†</a></sup></p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    I will restore your judges as at the first,</p><p>
    and your counsellors as at the beginning.</p><p>Afterward you shall be called ‘The city of righteousness,</p><p>
    a faithful town.’</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>
    Zion shall be redeemed with justice,</p><p>
    and her converts with righteousness.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>
    But the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be together,</p><p>
    and those who forsake the LORD shall be consumed.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>
    For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired,</p><p>
    and you shall be confounded for the gardens that you have chosen.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>
    For you shall be as an oak whose leaf fades,</p><p>
    and as a garden that has no water.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>
    The strong will be like tinder,</p><p>
    and his work like a spark.</p><p>
    They will both burn together,</p><p>
    and no one will quench them.”</p><a href="#Isaiah-c-2"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-2">2</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    This is what Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    It shall happen in the latter days, that the mountain of the LORD’s house shall be established on the top of the mountains,</p><p>
    and shall be raised above the hills;</p><p>
    and all nations shall flow to it.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    Many peoples shall go and say,</p><p>“Come, let’s go up to the mountain of the LORD,</p><p>
    to the house of the God of Jacob;</p><p>
    and he will teach us of his ways,</p><p>
    and we will walk in his paths.”</p><p>
    For the law shall go out of Zion,</p><p>
    and the LORD’s word from Jerusalem.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    He will judge between the nations,</p><p>
    and will decide concerning many peoples.</p><p>
    They shall beat their swords into ploughshares,</p><p>
    and their spears into pruning hooks.</p><p>
    Nation shall not lift up sword against nation,</p><p>
    neither shall they learn war any more.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    House of Jacob, come, and let’s walk in the light of the LORD.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    For you have forsaken your people, the house of Jacob,</p><p>
    because they are filled from the east,</p><p>
    with those who practise divination like the Philistines,</p><p>
    and they clasp hands with the children of foreigners.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    Their land is full of silver and gold,</p><p>neither is there any end of their treasures.</p><p>
    Their land also is full of horses,</p><p>neither is there any end of their chariots.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    Their land also is full of idols.</p><p>
    They worship the work of their own hands,</p><p>
    that which their own fingers have made.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    Man is brought low,</p><p>
    and mankind is humbled;</p><p>therefore don’t forgive them.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Enter into the rock,</p><p>
    and hide in the dust,</p><p>
    from before the terror of the LORD,</p><p>
    and from the glory of his majesty.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    The lofty looks of man will be brought low,</p><p>
    the arrogance of men will be bowed down,</p><p>
    and the LORD alone will be exalted in that day.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    For there will be a day of the LORD of Armies for all that is proud and arrogant,</p><p>
    and for all that is lifted up,</p><p>
    and it shall be brought low—</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    for all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up,</p><p>
    for all the oaks of Bashan,</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    for all the high mountains,</p><p>
    for all the hills that are lifted up,</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    for every lofty tower,</p><p>
    for every fortified wall,</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    for all the ships of Tarshish,</p><p>
    and for all pleasant imagery.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    The loftiness of man shall be bowed down,</p><p>
    and the arrogance of men shall be brought low;</p><p>
    and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    The idols shall utterly pass away.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Men shall go into the caves of the rocks,</p><p>
    and into the holes of the earth,</p><p>
    from before the terror of the LORD,</p><p>
    and from the glory of his majesty,</p><p>
    when he arises to shake the earth mightily.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    In that day, men shall cast away their idols of silver</p><p>
    and their idols of gold,</p><p>
    which have been made for themselves to worship,</p><p>
    to the moles and to the bats,</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    to go into the caverns of the rocks,</p><p>
    and into the clefts of the ragged rocks,</p><p>
    from before the terror of the LORD,</p><p>
    and from the glory of his majesty,</p><p>
    when he arises to shake the earth mightily.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    Stop trusting in man, whose breath is in his nostrils;</p><p>
    for of what account is he?</p><a href="#Isaiah-c-3"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-3">3</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    For, behold,<sup><a href="#footnote-5" id="ref-5">†</a></sup> the Lord, GOD<sup><a href="#footnote-6" id="ref-6">†</a></sup> of Armies, takes away from Jerusalem and from Judah supply and support,</p><p>
    the whole supply of bread,</p><p>
    and the whole supply of water;</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    the mighty man,</p><p>
    the man of war,</p><p>
    the judge,</p><p>
    the prophet,</p><p>
    the diviner,</p><p>
    the elder,</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    the captain of fifty,</p><p>
    the honourable man,</p><p>
    the counsellor,</p><p>
    the skilled craftsman,</p><p>
    and the clever enchanter.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    I will give boys to be their princes,</p><p>
    and children shall rule over them.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    The people will be oppressed,</p><p>everyone by another,</p><p>
    and everyone by his neighbour.</p><p>
    The child will behave himself proudly against the old man,</p><p>
    and the wicked against the honourable.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    Indeed a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father, saying,</p><p>“You have clothing, you be our ruler,</p><p>
    and let this ruin be under your hand.”</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    In that day he will cry out, saying, “I will not be a healer;</p><p>
    for in my house is neither bread nor clothing.</p><p>
    You shall not make me ruler of the people.”</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen;</p><p>
    because their tongue and their doings are against the LORD,<sup><a href="#footnote-7" id="ref-7">†</a></sup></p><p>
    to provoke the eyes of his glory.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    The look of their faces testify against them.</p><p>
    They parade their sin like Sodom.</p><p>
    They don’t hide it.</p><p>Woe to their soul!</p><p>
    For they have brought disaster upon themselves.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Tell the righteous that it will be well with them,</p><p>
    for they will eat the fruit of their deeds.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Woe to the wicked!</p><p>
    Disaster is upon them,</p><p>
    for the deeds of their hands will be paid back to them.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    As for my people, children are their oppressors,</p><p>
    and women rule over them.</p><p>
    My people, those who lead you cause you to err,</p><p>
    and destroy the way of your paths.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    The LORD stands up to contend,</p><p>
    and stands to judge the peoples.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    The LORD will enter into judgement with the elders of his people</p><p>
    and their leaders:</p><p>“It is you who have eaten up the vineyard.</p><p>
    The plunder of the poor is in your houses.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>What do you mean that you crush my people,</p><p>
    and grind the face of the poor?” says the Lord, GOD<sup><a href="#footnote-8" id="ref-8">†</a></sup> of Armies.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    Moreover the LORD said, “Because the daughters of Zion are arrogant,</p><p>
    and walk with outstretched necks and flirting eyes,</p><p>
    walking daintily as they go,</p><p>jingling ornaments on their feet;</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    therefore the Lord brings sores on the crown of the head of the women of Zion,</p><p>
    and the LORD will make their scalps bald.”</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, the headbands, the crescent necklaces, <sup>19</sup>the earrings, the bracelets, the veils, <sup>20</sup>the headdresses, the ankle chains, the sashes, the perfume containers, the charms, <sup>21</sup>the signet rings, the nose rings, <sup>22</sup>the fine robes, the capes, the cloaks, the purses, <sup>23</sup>the hand mirrors, the fine linen garments, the tiaras, and the shawls.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    It shall happen that instead of sweet spices, there shall be rottenness;</p><p>
    instead of a belt, a rope;</p><p>
    instead of well set hair, baldness;</p><p>
    instead of a robe, a wearing of sackcloth;</p><p>
    and branding instead of beauty.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    Your men shall fall by the sword,</p><p>
    and your mighty in the war.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>Her gates shall lament and mourn.</p><p>She shall be desolate and sit on the ground.</p><a href="#Isaiah-c-4"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-4">4</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying, “We will eat our own bread, and wear our own clothing. Just let us be called by your name. Take away our reproach.”</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    In that day, the LORD’s branch will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be the beauty and glory of the survivors of Israel. <sup>3</sup>It will happen that he who is left in Zion and he who remains in Jerusalem shall be called holy, even everyone who is written amongst the living in Jerusalem, <sup>4</sup>when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from within it, by the spirit of justice and by the spirit of burning. <sup>5</sup>The LORD will create over the whole habitation of Mount Zion and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night, for over all the glory will be a canopy. <sup>6</sup>There will be a pavilion for a shade in the daytime from the heat, and for a refuge and for a shelter from storm and from rain.</p><a href="#Isaiah-c-5"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-5">5</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Let me sing for my well beloved a song of my beloved about his vineyard.</p><p>
    My beloved had a vineyard on a very fruitful hill.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    He dug it up,</p><p>
    gathered out its stones,</p><p>
    planted it with the choicest vine,</p><p>
    built a tower in the middle of it,</p><p>
    and also cut out a wine press in it.</p><p>
    He looked for it to yield grapes,</p><p>
    but it yielded wild grapes.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>“Now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah,</p><p>
    please judge between me and my vineyard.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it?</p><p>
    Why, when I looked for it to yield grapes, did it yield wild grapes?</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard.</p><p>
    I will take away its hedge, and it will be eaten up.</p><p>
    I will break down its wall, and it will be trampled down.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    I will lay it a wasteland.</p><p>
    It won’t be pruned or hoed,</p><p>
    but it will grow briers and thorns.</p><p>
    I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain on it.”</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    For the vineyard of the LORD of Armies is the house of Israel,</p><p>
    and the men of Judah his pleasant plant.</p><p>
    He looked for justice, but behold, oppression,</p><p>
    for righteousness, but behold, a cry of distress.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    Woe to those who join house to house,</p><p>
    who lay field to field, until there is no room,</p><p>
    and you are made to dwell alone in the middle of the land!</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    In my ears, the LORD of Armies says: “Surely many houses will be desolate,</p><p>
    even great and beautiful, unoccupied.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    For ten acres<sup><a href="#footnote-9" id="ref-9">†</a></sup> of vineyard shall yield one bath,<sup><a href="#footnote-10" id="ref-10">†</a></sup></p><p>
    and a homer<sup><a href="#footnote-11" id="ref-11">†</a></sup> of seed shall yield an ephah.”<sup><a href="#footnote-12" id="ref-12">†</a></sup></p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    Woe to those who rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink,</p><p>
    who stay late into the night, until wine inflames them!</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    The harp, lyre, tambourine, and flute, with wine, are at their feasts;</p><p>
    but they don’t respect the work of the LORD,</p><p>
    neither have they considered the operation of his hands.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    Therefore my people go into captivity for lack of knowledge.</p><p>
    Their honourable men are famished,</p><p>
    and their multitudes are parched with thirst.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    Therefore Sheol<sup><a href="#footnote-13" id="ref-13">†</a></sup> has enlarged its desire,</p><p>
    and opened its mouth without measure;</p><p>
    and their glory, their multitude, their pomp, and he who rejoices amongst them, descend into it.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>So man is brought low,</p><p>mankind is humbled,</p><p>
    and the eyes of the arrogant ones are humbled;</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    but the LORD of Armies is exalted in justice,</p><p>
    and God the Holy One is sanctified in righteousness.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Then the lambs will graze as in their pasture,</p><p>
    and strangers will eat the ruins of the rich.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood,</p><p>
    and wickedness as with cart rope,</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    who say, “Let him make haste, let him hasten his work, that we may see it;</p><p>let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come,</p><p>
    that we may know it!”</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil;</p><p>
    who put darkness for light,</p><p>
    and light for darkness;</p><p>
    who put bitter for sweet,</p><p>
    and sweet for bitter!</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes,</p><p>
    and prudent in their own sight!</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    Woe to those who are mighty to drink wine,</p><p>
    and champions at mixing strong drink;</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    who acquit the guilty for a bribe,</p><p>
    but deny justice for the innocent!</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    Therefore as the tongue of fire devours the stubble,</p><p>
    and as the dry grass sinks down in the flame,</p><p>
    so their root shall be as rottenness,</p><p>
    and their blossom shall go up as dust,</p><p>
    because they have rejected the law of the LORD of Armies,</p><p>
    and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    Therefore the LORD’s anger burns against his people,</p><p>
    and he has stretched out his hand against them and has struck them.</p><p>
    The mountains tremble,</p><p>
    and their dead bodies are as refuse in the middle of the streets.</p><p>
    For all this, his anger is not turned away,</p><p>
    but his hand is still stretched out.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    He will lift up a banner to the nations from far away,</p><p>
    and he will whistle for them from the end of the earth.</p><p>
    Behold, they will come speedily and swiftly.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>
    No one shall be weary nor stumble amongst them;</p><p>
    no one shall slumber nor sleep,</p><p>
    neither shall the belt of their waist be untied,</p><p>
    nor the strap of their sandals be broken,</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>
    whose arrows are sharp,</p><p>
    and all their bows bent.</p><p>
    Their horses’ hoofs will be like flint,</p><p>
    and their wheels like a whirlwind.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>
    Their roaring will be like a lioness.</p><p>They will roar like young lions.</p><p>Yes, they shall roar,</p><p>
    and seize their prey and carry it off,</p><p>
    and there will be no one to deliver.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>
    They will roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea.</p><p>
    If one looks to the land, behold, darkness and distress.</p><p>
    The light is darkened in its clouds.</p><a href="#Isaiah-c-6"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-6">6</h3></a>

    <sup>1</sup>
    In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple. <sup>2</sup>Above him stood the seraphim. Each one had six wings. With two he covered his face. With two he covered his feet. With two he flew. <sup>3</sup>One called to another, and said,</p><p>“Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of Armies!</p><p>
    The whole earth is full of his glory!”</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    The foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke. <sup>5</sup>Then I said, “Woe is me! For I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips and I live amongst a people of unclean lips, for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of Armies!”</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar. <sup>7</sup>He touched my mouth with it, and said, “Behold, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin forgiven.”</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    I heard the Lord’s voice, saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?”</p><p>
    Then I said, “Here I am. Send me!”</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    He said, “Go, and tell this people,</p><p>‘You hear indeed,</p><p>
    but don’t understand.</p><p>
    You see indeed,</p><p>
    but don’t perceive.’</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    Make the heart of this people fat.</p><p>
    Make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes;</p><p>
    lest they see with their eyes,</p><p>
    hear with their ears,</p><p>
    understand with their heart,</p><p>
    and turn again, and be healed.”</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Then I said, “Lord, how long?”</p><p>
    He answered,</p><p>“Until cities are waste without inhabitant,</p><p>
    houses without man,</p><p>
    the land becomes utterly waste,</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    and the LORD has removed men far away,</p><p>
    and the forsaken places are many within the land.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    If there is a tenth left in it,</p><p>
    that also will in turn be consumed,</p><p>
    as a terebinth, and as an oak whose stump remains when they are cut down,</p><p>
    so the holy seed is its stump.”</p><a href="#Isaiah-c-7"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-7">7</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    In the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin the king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it. <sup>2</sup>David’s house was told, “Syria is allied with Ephraim.” His heart trembled, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    Then the LORD said to Isaiah, “Go out now to meet Ahaz, you, and Shearjashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, on the highway of the fuller’s field. <sup>4</sup>Tell him, ‘Be careful, and keep calm. Don’t be afraid, neither let your heart be faint because of these two tails of smoking torches, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria, and of the son of Remaliah. <sup>5</sup>Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have plotted evil against you, saying, <sup>6</sup>“Let’s go up against Judah, and tear it apart, and let’s divide it amongst ourselves, and set up a king within it, even the son of Tabeel.” <sup>7</sup>This is what the Lord GOD says: “It shall not stand, neither shall it happen.” <sup>8</sup>For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin. Within sixty-five years Ephraim shall be broken in pieces, so that it shall not be a people. <sup>9</sup>The head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah’s son. If you will not believe, surely you shall not be established.’”</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    The LORD spoke again to Ahaz, saying, <sup>11</sup>“Ask a sign of the LORD your God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.”</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    But Ahaz said, “I won’t ask. I won’t tempt the LORD.”</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    He said, “Listen now, house of David. Is it not enough for you to try the patience of men, that you will try the patience of my God also? <sup>14</sup>Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin will conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.<sup><a href="#footnote-14" id="ref-14">†</a></sup> <sup>15</sup>He shall eat butter and honey when he knows to refuse the evil and choose the good. <sup>16</sup>For before the child knows to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land whose two kings you abhor shall be forsaken. <sup>17</sup>The LORD will bring on you, on your people, and on your father’s house days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah, even the king of Assyria.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    It will happen in that day that the LORD will whistle for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria. <sup>19</sup>They shall come, and shall all rest in the desolate valleys, in the clefts of the rocks, on all thorn hedges, and on all pastures.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    In that day the Lord will shave with a razor that is hired in the parts beyond the River, even with the king of Assyria, the head and the hair of the feet; and it shall also consume the beard.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    It shall happen in that day that a man shall keep alive a young cow, and two sheep. <sup>22</sup>It shall happen, that because of the abundance of milk which they shall give he shall eat butter, for everyone will eat butter and honey that is left within the land.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    It will happen in that day that every place where there were a thousand vines worth a thousand silver shekels,<sup><a href="#footnote-15" id="ref-15">†</a></sup> will be for briers and thorns. <sup>24</sup>People will go there with arrows and with bow, because all the land will be briers and thorns. <sup>25</sup>All the hills that were cultivated with the hoe, you shall not come there for fear of briers and thorns; but it shall be for the sending out of oxen, and for sheep to tread on.”</p><a href="#Isaiah-c-8"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-8">8</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    The LORD said to me, “Take a large tablet, and write on it with a man’s pen, ‘For Maher Shalal Hash Baz’;<sup><a href="#footnote-16" id="ref-16">†</a></sup> <sup>2</sup>and I will take for myself faithful witnesses to testify: Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.”</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    I went to the prophetess, and she conceived, and bore a son. Then the LORD said to me, “Call his name ‘Maher Shalal Hash Baz.’ <sup>4</sup>For before the child knows how to say, ‘My father’ and ‘My mother,’ the riches of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried away by the king of Assyria.”</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    The LORD spoke to me yet again, saying, <sup>6</sup>“Because this people has refused the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah’s son; <sup>7</sup>now therefore, behold, the Lord brings upon them the mighty flood waters of the River: the king of Assyria and all his glory. It will come up over all its channels, and go over all its banks. <sup>8</sup>It will sweep onward into Judah. It will overflow and pass through. It will reach even to the neck. The stretching out of its wings will fill the width of your land, O Immanuel.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Make an uproar, you peoples, and be broken in pieces! Listen, all you from far countries: dress for battle, and be shattered! Dress for battle, and be shattered! <sup>10</sup>Take counsel together, and it will be brought to nothing; speak the word, and it will not stand, for God is with us.”</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    For the LORD spoke this to me with a strong hand, and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people, saying, <sup>12</sup>“Don’t call a conspiracy all that this people call a conspiracy. Don’t fear their threats or be terrorised. <sup>13</sup>The LORD of Armies is who you must respect as holy. He is the one you must fear. He is the one you must dread. <sup>14</sup>He will be a sanctuary, but for both houses of Israel, he will be a stumbling stone and a rock that makes them fall. For the people of Jerusalem, he will be a trap and a snare. <sup>15</sup>Many will stumble over it, fall, be broken, be snared, and be captured.”</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>Wrap up the covenant. Seal the law amongst my disciples. <sup>17</sup>I will wait for the LORD, who hides his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him. <sup>18</sup>Behold, I and the children whom the LORD has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of Armies, who dwells in Mount Zion.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    When they tell you, “Consult with those who have familiar spirits and with the wizards, who chirp and who mutter,” shouldn’t a people consult with their God? Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living? <sup>20</sup>Turn to the law and to the covenant! If they don’t speak according to this word, surely there is no morning for them. <sup>21</sup>They will pass through it, very distressed and hungry. It will happen that when they are hungry, they will worry, and curse their king and their God. They will turn their faces upward, <sup>22</sup>then look to the earth and see distress, darkness, and the gloom of anguish. They will be driven into thick darkness.</p><a href="#Isaiah-c-9"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-9">9</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    But there shall be no more gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time, he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali; but in the latter time he has made it glorious, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light.</p><p>
    The light has shined on those who lived in the land of the shadow of death.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    You have multiplied the nation.</p><p>
    You have increased their joy.</p><p>
    They rejoice before you according to the joy in harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the plunder. <sup>4</sup>For the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, you have broken as in the day of Midian. <sup>5</sup>For all the armour of the armed man in the noisy battle, and the garments rolled in blood, will be for burning, fuel for the fire. <sup>6</sup>For a child is born to us. A son is given to us; and the government will be on his shoulders. His name will be called Wonderful Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. <sup>7</sup>Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end, on David’s throne, and on his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from that time on, even forever. The zeal of the LORD of Armies will perform this.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    The Lord sent a word into Jacob,</p><p>
    and it falls on Israel.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>All the people will know,</p><p>including Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, who say in pride and in arrogance of heart,</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>“The bricks have fallen,</p><p>
    but we will build with cut stone.</p><p>
    The sycamore fig trees have been cut down,</p><p>
    but we will put cedars in their place.”</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    Therefore the LORD will set up on high against him the adversaries of Rezin,</p><p>
    and will stir up his enemies,</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    The Syrians in front,</p><p>
    and the Philistines behind;</p><p>
    and they will devour Israel with open mouth.</p><p>
    For all this, his anger is not turned away,</p><p>
    but his hand is stretched out still.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    Yet the people have not turned to him who struck them,</p><p>neither have they sought the LORD of Armies.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail,</p><p>palm branch and reed, in one day.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    The elder and the honourable man is the head,</p><p>
    and the prophet who teaches lies is the tail.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    For those who lead this people lead them astray;</p><p>
    and those who are led by them are destroyed.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    Therefore the Lord will not rejoice over their young men,</p><p>neither will he have compassion on their fatherless and widows;</p><p>
    for everyone is profane and an evildoer,</p><p>
    and every mouth speaks folly.</p><p>
    For all this his anger is not turned away,</p><p>
    but his hand is stretched out still.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    For wickedness burns like a fire.</p><p>
    It devours the briers and thorns;</p><p>yes, it kindles in the thickets of the forest,</p><p>
    and they roll upward in a column of smoke.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    Through the LORD of Armies’ wrath, the land is burnt up;</p><p>
    and the people are the fuel for the fire.</p><p>
    No one spares his brother.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    One will devour on the right hand, and be hungry;</p><p>
    and he will eat on the left hand, and they will not be satisfied.</p><p>
    Everyone will eat the flesh of his own arm:</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>Manasseh eating Ephraim and Ephraim eating Manasseh, and they together will be against Judah.</p><p>For all this his anger is not turned away,</p><p>but his hand is stretched out still.</p><a href="#Isaiah-c-10"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-10">10</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Woe to those who decree unrighteous decrees, and to the writers who write oppressive decrees <sup>2</sup>to deprive the needy of justice, and to rob the poor amongst my people of their rights, that widows may be their plunder, and that they may make the fatherless their prey! <sup>3</sup>What will you do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which will come from afar? To whom will you flee for help? Where will you leave your wealth?</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    They will only bow down under the prisoners,</p><p>
    and will fall under the slain.</p><p>
    For all this his anger is not turned away,</p><p>
    but his hand is stretched out still.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Alas Assyrian, the rod of my anger, the staff in whose hand is my indignation! <sup>6</sup>I will send him against a profane nation, and against the people who anger me I will give him a command to take the plunder and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets. <sup>7</sup>However, he doesn’t mean so, neither does his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy, and to cut off not a few nations. <sup>8</sup>For he says, “Aren’t all of my princes kings? <sup>9</sup>Isn’t Calno like Carchemish? Isn’t Hamath like Arpad? Isn’t Samaria like Damascus?” <sup>10</sup>As my hand has found the kingdoms of the idols, whose engraved images exceeded those of Jerusalem and of Samaria, <sup>11</sup>shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    Therefore it will happen that when the Lord has performed his whole work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the wilful proud heart of the king of Assyria, and the insolence of his arrogant looks. <sup>13</sup>For he has said, “By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom, for I have understanding. I have removed the boundaries of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures. Like a valiant man I have brought down their rulers. <sup>14</sup>My hand has found the riches of the peoples like a nest, and like one gathers eggs that are abandoned, I have gathered all the earth. There was no one who moved their wing, or that opened their mouth, or chirped.”</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    Should an axe brag against him who chops with it? Should a saw exalt itself above him who saws with it? As if a rod should lift those who lift it up, or as if a staff should lift up someone who is not wood. <sup>16</sup>Therefore the Lord, GOD<sup><a href="#footnote-17" id="ref-17">†</a></sup> of Armies, will send amongst his fat ones leanness; and under his glory a burning will be kindled like the burning of fire. <sup>17</sup>The light of Israel will be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame; and it will burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day. <sup>18</sup>He will consume the glory of his forest and of his fruitful field, both soul and body. It will be as when a standard bearer faints. <sup>19</sup>The remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few, so that a child could write their number.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    It will come to pass in that day that the remnant of Israel, and those who have escaped from the house of Jacob will no more again lean on him who struck them, but shall lean on the LORD,<sup><a href="#footnote-18" id="ref-18">†</a></sup> the Holy One of Israel, in truth. <sup>21</sup>A remnant will return, even the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God. <sup>22</sup>For though your people, Israel, are like the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will return. A destruction is determined, overflowing with righteousness. <sup>23</sup>For the Lord, GOD<sup><a href="#footnote-19" id="ref-19">†</a></sup> of Armies, will make a full end, and that determined, throughout all the earth.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    Therefore the Lord, GOD of Armies, says, “My people who dwell in Zion, don’t be afraid of the Assyrian, though he strike you with the rod, and lift up his staff against you, as Egypt did. <sup>25</sup>For yet a very little while, and the indignation against you will be accomplished, and my anger will be directed to his destruction.” <sup>26</sup>The LORD of Armies will stir up a scourge against him, as in the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb. His rod will be over the sea, and he will lift it up like he did against Egypt. <sup>27</sup>It will happen in that day that his burden will depart from off your shoulder, and his yoke from off your neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing oil.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>
    He has come to Aiath. He has passed through Migron. At Michmash he stores his baggage. <sup>29</sup>They have gone over the pass. They have taken up their lodging at Geba. Ramah trembles. Gibeah of Saul has fled. <sup>30</sup>Cry aloud with your voice, daughter of Gallim! Listen, Laishah! You poor Anathoth! <sup>31</sup>Madmenah is a fugitive. The inhabitants of Gebim flee for safety. <sup>32</sup>This very day he will halt at Nob. He shakes his hand at the mountain of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>
    Behold, the Lord, GOD of Armies, will lop the boughs with terror. The tall will be cut down, and the lofty will be brought low. <sup>34</sup>He will cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon will fall by the Mighty One.</p><a href="#Isaiah-c-11"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-11">11</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    A shoot will come out of the stock of Jesse,</p><p>
    and a branch out of his roots will bear fruit.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    The LORD’s Spirit will rest on him:</p><p>
    the spirit of wisdom and understanding,</p><p>
    the spirit of counsel and might,</p><p>
    the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    His delight will be in the fear of the LORD.</p><p>
    He will not judge by the sight of his eyes,</p><p>
    neither decide by the hearing of his ears;</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    but he will judge the poor with righteousness,</p><p>
    and decide with equity for the humble of the earth.</p><p>
    He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth;</p><p>
    and with the breath of his lips he will kill the wicked.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Righteousness will be the belt around his waist,</p><p>
    and faithfulness the belt around his waist.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    The wolf will live with the lamb,</p><p>
    and the leopard will lie down with the young goat,</p><p>
    the calf, the young lion, and the fattened calf together;</p><p>
    and a little child will lead them.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    The cow and the bear will graze.</p><p>
    Their young ones will lie down together.</p><p>
    The lion will eat straw like the ox.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    The nursing child will play near a cobra’s hole,</p><p>
    and the weaned child will put his hand on the viper’s den.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    They will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain;</p><p>
    for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the LORD,</p><p>
    as the waters cover the sea.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    It will happen in that day that the nations will seek the root of Jesse, who stands as a banner of the peoples; and his resting place will be glorious.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    It will happen in that day that the Lord will set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant that is left of his people from Assyria, from Egypt, from Pathros, from Cush, from Elam, from Shinar, from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea. <sup>12</sup>He will set up a banner for the nations, and will assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth. <sup>13</sup>The envy also of Ephraim will depart, and those who persecute Judah will be cut off. Ephraim won’t envy Judah, and Judah won’t persecute Ephraim. <sup>14</sup>They will fly down on the shoulders of the Philistines on the west. Together they will plunder the children of the east. They will extend their power over Edom and Moab, and the children of Ammon will obey them. <sup>15</sup>The LORD will utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with his scorching wind he will wave his hand over the River, and will split it into seven streams, and cause men to march over in sandals. <sup>16</sup>There will be a highway for the remnant that is left of his people from Assyria, like there was for Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.</p><a href="#Isaiah-c-12"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-12">12</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    In that day you will say, “I will give thanks to you, the LORD;<sup><a href="#footnote-20" id="ref-20">†</a></sup> for though you were angry with me, your anger has turned away and you comfort me. <sup>2</sup>Behold, God is my salvation. I will trust, and will not be afraid; for the LORD,<sup><a href="#footnote-21" id="ref-21">†</a></sup> the LORD,<sup><a href="#footnote-22" id="ref-22">†</a></sup> is my strength and song; and he has become my salvation.” <sup>3</sup>Therefore with joy you will draw water out of the wells of salvation. <sup>4</sup>In that day you will say, “Give thanks to the LORD! Call on his name! Declare his doings amongst the peoples! Proclaim that his name is exalted! <sup>5</sup>Sing to the LORD, for he has done excellent things! Let this be known in all the earth! <sup>6</sup>Cry aloud and shout, you inhabitant of Zion, for the Holy One of Israel is great amongst you!”</p><a href="#Isaiah-c-13"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-13">13</h3></a>

    <sup>1</sup>
    The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    Set up a banner on the bare mountain! Lift up your voice to them! Wave your hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles. <sup>3</sup>I have commanded my consecrated ones; yes, I have called my mighty men for my anger, even my proudly exulting ones. <sup>4</sup>The noise of a multitude is in the mountains, as of a great people; the noise of an uproar of the kingdoms of the nations gathered together! The LORD of Armies is mustering the army for the battle. <sup>5</sup>They come from a far country, from the uttermost part of heaven, even the LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    Wail, for the LORD’s day is at hand! It will come as destruction from the Almighty. <sup>7</sup>Therefore all hands will be feeble, and everyone’s heart will melt. <sup>8</sup>They will be dismayed. Pangs and sorrows will seize them. They will be in pain like a woman in labour. They will look in amazement one at another. Their faces will be faces of flame. <sup>9</sup>Behold, the day of the LORD comes, cruel, with wrath and fierce anger; to make the land a desolation, and to destroy its sinners out of it. <sup>10</sup>For the stars of the sky and its constellations will not give their light. The sun will be darkened in its going out, and the moon will not cause its light to shine. <sup>11</sup>I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity. I will cause the arrogance of the proud to cease, and will humble the arrogance of the terrible. <sup>12</sup>I will make people more rare than fine gold, even a person than the pure gold of Ophir. <sup>13</sup>Therefore I will make the heavens tremble, and the earth will be shaken out of its place in the LORD of Armies’ wrath, and in the day of his fierce anger. <sup>14</sup>It will happen that like a hunted gazelle and like sheep that no one gathers, they will each turn to their own people, and will each flee to their own land. <sup>15</sup>Everyone who is found will be thrust through. Everyone who is captured will fall by the sword. <sup>16</sup>Their infants also will be dashed in pieces before their eyes. Their houses will be ransacked, and their wives raped.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, who will not value silver, and as for gold, they will not delight in it. <sup>18</sup>Their bows will dash the young men in pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb. Their eyes will not spare children. <sup>19</sup>Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldeans’ pride, will be like when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. <sup>20</sup>It will never be inhabited, neither will it be lived in from generation to generation. The Arabian will not pitch a tent there, neither will shepherds make their flocks lie down there. <sup>21</sup>But wild animals of the desert will lie there, and their houses will be full of jackals. Ostriches will dwell there, and wild goats will frolic there. <sup>22</sup>Hyenas will cry in their fortresses, and jackals in the pleasant palaces. Her time is near to come, and her days will not be prolonged.</p><a href="#Isaiah-c-14"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-14">14</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    For the LORD will have compassion on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and set them in their own land. The foreigner will join himself with them, and they will unite with the house of Jacob. <sup>2</sup>The peoples will take them, and bring them to their place. The house of Israel will possess them in the LORD’s land for servants and for handmaids. They will take as captives those whose captives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors.</p><p>

    It will happen in the day that the LORD will give you rest from your sorrow, from your trouble, and from the hard service in which you were made to serve, <sup>4</sup>that you will take up this parable against the king of Babylon, and say, “How the oppressor has ceased! The golden city has ceased!” <sup>5</sup>The LORD has broken the staff of the wicked, the sceptre of the rulers, <sup>6</sup>who struck the peoples in wrath with a continual stroke, who ruled the nations in anger, with a persecution that no one restrained. <sup>7</sup>The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet. They break out in song. <sup>8</sup>Yes, the cypress trees rejoice with you, with the cedars of Lebanon, saying, “Since you are humbled, no lumberjack has come up against us.” <sup>9</sup>Sheol<sup><a href="#footnote-23" id="ref-23">†</a></sup> from beneath has moved for you to meet you at your coming. It stirs up the departed spirits for you, even all the rulers of the earth. It has raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations. <sup>10</sup>They all will answer and ask you, “Have you also become as weak as we are? Have you become like us?” <sup>11</sup>Your pomp is brought down to Sheol,<sup><a href="#footnote-24" id="ref-24">†</a></sup> with the sound of your stringed instruments. Maggots are spread out under you, and worms cover you.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>How you have fallen from heaven, shining one, son of the dawn! How you are cut down to the ground, who laid the nations low! <sup>13</sup>You said in your heart, “I will ascend into heaven! I will exalt my throne above the stars of God! I will sit on the mountain of assembly, in the far north! <sup>14</sup>I will ascend above the heights of the clouds! I will make myself like the Most High!” <sup>15</sup>Yet you shall be brought down to Sheol,<sup><a href="#footnote-25" id="ref-25">†</a></sup> to the depths of the pit. <sup>16</sup>Those who see you will stare at you. They will ponder you, saying, “Is this the man who made the earth to tremble, who shook kingdoms, <sup>17</sup>who made the world like a wilderness, and overthrew its cities, who didn’t release his prisoners to their home?”</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    All the kings of the nations sleep in glory, everyone in his own house. <sup>19</sup>But you are cast away from your tomb like an abominable branch, clothed with the slain who are thrust through with the sword, who go down to the stones of the pit; like a dead body trodden under foot. <sup>20</sup>You will not join them in burial, because you have destroyed your land. You have killed your people. The offspring of evildoers will not be named forever.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    Prepare for slaughter of his children because of the iniquity of their fathers, that they not rise up and possess the earth, and fill the surface of the world with cities. <sup>22</sup>“I will rise up against them,” says the LORD of Armies, “and cut off from Babylon name and remnant, and son and son’s son,” says the LORD. <sup>23</sup>“I will also make it a possession for the porcupine, and pools of water. I will sweep it with the broom of destruction,” says the LORD of Armies.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    The LORD of Armies has sworn, saying, “Surely, as I have thought, so shall it happen; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand: <sup>25</sup>that I will break the Assyrian in my land, and tread him under foot on my mountains. Then his yoke will leave them, and his burden leave their shoulders. <sup>26</sup>This is the plan that is determined for the whole earth. This is the hand that is stretched out over all the nations. <sup>27</sup>For the LORD of Armies has planned, and who can stop it? His hand is stretched out, and who can turn it back?”</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>
    This burden was in the year that King Ahaz died.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>Don’t rejoice, O Philistia, all of you, because the rod that struck you is broken; for out of the serpent’s root an adder will emerge, and his fruit will be a fiery flying serpent. <sup>30</sup>The firstborn of the poor will eat, and the needy will lie down in safety; and I will kill your root with famine, and your remnant will be killed.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>
    Howl, gate! Cry, city! You are melted away, Philistia, all of you; for smoke comes out of the north, and there is no straggler in his ranks.</p><p>

    The burden of Moab.</p><p>
    For in a night, Ar of Moab is laid waste, and brought to nothing. For in a night Kir of Moab is laid waste, and brought to nothing. <sup>2</sup>They have gone up to Bayith, and to Dibon, to the high places, to weep. Moab wails over Nebo and over Medeba. Baldness is on all of their heads. Every beard is cut off. <sup>3</sup>In their streets, they clothe themselves in sackcloth. In their streets and on their housetops, everyone wails, weeping abundantly. <sup>4</sup>Heshbon cries out with Elealeh. Their voice is heard even to Jahaz. Therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud. Their souls tremble within them. <sup>5</sup>My heart cries out for Moab! Her nobles flee to Zoar, to Eglath Shelishiyah; for they go up by the ascent of Luhith with weeping; for on the way to Horonaim, they raise up a cry of destruction. <sup>6</sup>For the waters of Nimrim will be desolate; for the grass has withered away, the tender grass fails, there is no green thing. <sup>7</sup>Therefore they will carry away the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have stored up, over the brook of the willows. <sup>8</sup>For the cry has gone around the borders of Moab, its wailing to Eglaim, and its wailing to Beer Elim. <sup>9</sup>For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; for I will bring yet more on Dimon, a lion on those of Moab who escape, and on the remnant of the land.</p><a href="#Isaiah-c-16"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-16">16</h3></a>

    Send the lambs for the ruler of the land from Selah to the wilderness, to the mountain of the daughter of Zion. <sup>2</sup>For it will be that as wandering birds, as a scattered nest, so will the daughters of Moab be at the fords of the Arnon. <sup>3</sup>Give counsel! Execute justice! Make your shade like the night in the middle of the noonday! Hide the outcasts! Don’t betray the fugitive! <sup>4</sup>Let my outcasts dwell with you! As for Moab, be a hiding place for him from the face of the destroyer. For the extortionist is brought to nothing. Destruction ceases. The oppressors are consumed out of the land. <sup>5</sup>A throne will be established in loving kindness. One will sit on it in truth, in the tent of David, judging, seeking justice, and swift to do righteousness.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    We have heard of the pride of Moab, that he is very proud; even of his arrogance, his pride, and his wrath. His boastings are nothing. <sup>7</sup>Therefore Moab will wail for Moab. Everyone will wail. You will mourn for the raisin cakes of Kir Hareseth, utterly stricken. <sup>8</sup>For the fields of Heshbon languish with the vine of Sibmah. The lords of the nations have broken down its choice branches, which reached even to Jazer, which wandered into the wilderness. Its shoots were spread abroad. They passed over the sea. <sup>9</sup>Therefore I will weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sibmah. I will water you with my tears, Heshbon, and Elealeh: for on your summer fruits and on your harvest the battle shout has fallen. <sup>10</sup>Gladness is taken away, and joy out of the fruitful field; and in the vineyards there will be no singing, neither joyful noise. Nobody will tread out wine in the presses. I have made the shouting stop. <sup>11</sup>Therefore my heart sounds like a harp for Moab, and my inward parts for Kir Heres. <sup>12</sup>It will happen that when Moab presents himself, when he wearies himself on the high place, and comes to his sanctuary to pray, that he will not prevail.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    This is the word that the LORD spoke concerning Moab in time past. <sup>14</sup>But now the LORD has spoken, saying, “Within three years, as a worker bound by contract would count them, the glory of Moab shall be brought into contempt, with all his great multitude; and the remnant will be very small and feeble.”</p><a href="#Isaiah-c-17"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-17">17</h3></a>

    The burden of Damascus.</p><p>“Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it will be a ruinous heap. <sup>2</sup>The cities of Aroer are forsaken. They will be for flocks, which shall lie down, and no one shall make them afraid. <sup>3</sup>The fortress shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria. They will be as the glory of the children of Israel,” says the LORD of Armies.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>“It will happen in that day that the glory of Jacob will be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh will become lean. <sup>5</sup>It will be like when the harvester gathers the wheat, and his arm reaps the grain. Yes, it will be like when one gleans grain in the valley of Rephaim. <sup>6</sup>Yet gleanings will be left there, like the shaking of an olive tree, two or three olives in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the outermost branches of a fruitful tree,” says the LORD, the God of Israel. <sup>7</sup>In that day, people will look to their Maker, and their eyes will have respect for the Holy One of Israel. <sup>8</sup>They will not look to the altars, the work of their hands; neither shall they respect that which their fingers have made, either the Asherah poles or the incense altars. <sup>9</sup>In that day, their strong cities will be like the forsaken places in the woods and on the mountain top, which were forsaken from before the children of Israel; and it will be a desolation. <sup>10</sup>For you have forgotten the God of your salvation, and have not remembered the rock of your strength. Therefore you plant pleasant plants, and set out foreign seedlings. <sup>11</sup>In the day of your planting, you hedge it in. In the morning, you make your seed blossom, but the harvest flees away in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    Ah, the uproar of many peoples who roar like the roaring of the seas; and the rushing of nations that rush like the rushing of mighty waters! <sup>13</sup>The nations will rush like the rushing of many waters, but he will rebuke them, and they will flee far off, and will be chased like the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like the whirling dust before the storm. <sup>14</sup>At evening, behold, terror! Before the morning, they are no more. This is the portion of those who plunder us, and the lot of those who rob us.</p><a href="#Isaiah-c-18"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-18">18</h3></a>

When the trumpet is blown, listen!</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    For the LORD said to me, “I will be still, and I will see in my dwelling place, like clear heat in sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.” <sup>5</sup>For before the harvest, when the blossom is over, and the flower becomes a ripening grape, he will cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and he will cut down and take away the spreading branches. <sup>6</sup>They will be left together for the ravenous birds of the mountains, and for the animals of the earth. The ravenous birds will eat them in the summer, and all the animals of the earth will eat them in the winter. <sup>7</sup>In that time, a present will be brought to the LORD of Armies from a people tall and smooth, even from a people awesome from their beginning onward, a nation that measures out and treads down, whose land the rivers divide, to the place of the name of the LORD of Armies, Mount Zion.</p><a href="#Isaiah-c-19"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-19">19</h3></a>

    The burden of Egypt.</p><p>“Behold, the LORD rides on a swift cloud, and comes to Egypt. The idols of Egypt will tremble at his presence; and the heart of Egypt will melt within it. <sup>2</sup>I will stir up the Egyptians against the Egyptians, and they will fight everyone against his brother, and everyone against his neighbour; city against city, and kingdom against kingdom. <sup>3</sup>The spirit of the Egyptians will fail within them. I will destroy their counsel. They will seek the idols, the charmers, those who have familiar spirits, and the wizards. <sup>4</sup>I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord. A fierce king will rule over them,” says the Lord, GOD<sup><a href="#footnote-26" id="ref-26">†</a></sup> of Armies.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    The waters will fail from the sea, and the river will be wasted and become dry. <sup>6</sup>The rivers will become foul. The streams of Egypt will be diminished and dried up. The reeds and flags will wither away. <sup>7</sup>The meadows by the Nile, by the brink of the Nile, and all the sown fields of the Nile, will become dry, be driven away, and be no more. <sup>8</sup>The fishermen will lament, and all those who fish in the Nile will mourn, and those who spread nets on the waters will languish. <sup>9</sup>Moreover those who work in combed flax, and those who weave white cloth, will be confounded. <sup>10</sup>The pillars will be broken in pieces. All those who work for hire will be grieved in soul.</p><p>

    The princes of Zoan are utterly foolish. The counsel of the wisest counsellors of Pharaoh has become stupid. How do you say to Pharaoh, “I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings”? <sup>12</sup>Where then are your wise men? Let them tell you now; and let them know what the LORD of Armies has purposed concerning Egypt. <sup>13</sup>The princes of Zoan have become fools. The princes of Memphis are deceived. They have caused Egypt to go astray, those who are the cornerstone of her tribes. <sup>14</sup>The LORD has mixed a spirit of perverseness in the middle of her; and they have caused Egypt to go astray in all of its works, like a drunken man staggers in his vomit. <sup>15</sup>Neither shall there be any work for Egypt, which head or tail, palm branch or rush, may do. <sup>16</sup>In that day the Egyptians will be like women. They will tremble and fear because of the shaking of the LORD of Armies’s hand, which he shakes over them. <sup>17</sup>The land of Judah will become a terror to Egypt. Everyone to whom mention is made of it will be afraid, because of the plans of the LORD of Armies, which he determines against it. <sup>18</sup>In that day, there will be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan, and swear to the LORD of Armies. One will be called “The city of destruction.”</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    In that day, there will be an altar to the LORD in the middle of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to the LORD at its border. <sup>20</sup>It will be for a sign and for a witness to the LORD of Armies in the land of Egypt; for they will cry to the LORD because of oppressors, and he will send them a saviour and a defender, and he will deliver them. <sup>21</sup>The LORD will be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians will know the LORD in that day. Yes, they will worship with sacrifice and offering, and will vow a vow to the LORD, and will perform it. <sup>22</sup>The LORD will strike Egypt, striking and healing. They will return to the LORD, and he will be entreated by them, and will heal them.</p><p>

    In that day there will be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria; and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians.</p><p>

    In that day, Israel will be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, a blessing within the earth; <sup>25</sup>because the LORD of Armies has blessed them, saying, “Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel my inheritance.”</p><a href="#Isaiah-c-20"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-20">20</h3></a>

    As whirlwinds in the South sweep through, it comes from the wilderness, from an awesome land. <sup>2</sup>A grievous vision is declared to me. The treacherous man deals treacherously, and the destroyer destroys. Go up, Elam; attack! I have stopped all of Media’s sighing. <sup>3</sup>Therefore my thighs are filled with anguish. Pains have seized me, like the pains of a woman in labour. I am in so much pain that I can’t hear. I am so dismayed that I can’t see. <sup>4</sup>My heart flutters. Horror has frightened me. The twilight that I desired has been turned into trembling for me. <sup>5</sup>They prepare the table. They set the watch. They eat. They drink. Rise up, you princes, oil the shield! <sup>6</sup>For the Lord said to me, “Go, set a watchman. Let him declare what he sees. <sup>7</sup>When he sees a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of donkeys, a troop of camels, he shall listen diligently with great attentiveness.” <sup>8</sup>He cried like a lion: “Lord, I stand continually on the watchtower in the daytime, and every night I stay at my post. <sup>9</sup>Behold, here comes a troop of men, horsemen in pairs.” He answered, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the engraved images of her gods are broken to the ground.</p><p>

    What ails you now, that you have all gone up to the housetops? <sup>2</sup>You that are full of shouting, a tumultuous city, a joyous town, your slain are not slain with the sword, neither are they dead in battle. <sup>3</sup>All your rulers fled away together. They were bound by the archers. All who were found by you were bound together. They fled far away. <sup>4</sup>Therefore I said, “Look away from me. I will weep bitterly. Don’t labour to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter of my people.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    For it is a day of confusion, and of treading down, and of perplexity from the Lord, GOD<sup><a href="#footnote-27" id="ref-27">†</a></sup> of Armies, in the valley of vision, a breaking down of the walls, and a crying to the mountains.” <sup>6</sup>Elam carried his quiver, with chariots of men and horsemen; and Kir uncovered the shield. <sup>7</sup>Your choicest valleys were full of chariots, and the horsemen set themselves in array at the gate. <sup>8</sup>He took away the covering of Judah; and you looked in that day to the armour in the house of the forest. <sup>9</sup>You saw the breaches of David’s city, that they were many; and you gathered together the waters of the lower pool. <sup>10</sup>You counted the houses of Jerusalem, and you broke down the houses to fortify the wall. <sup>11</sup>You also made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool. But you didn’t look to him who had done this, neither did you have respect for him who planned it long ago.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    In that day, the Lord, GOD<sup><a href="#footnote-28" id="ref-28">†</a></sup> of Armies, called to weeping, to mourning, to baldness, and to dressing in sackcloth; <sup>13</sup>and behold, there is joy and gladness, killing cattle and killing sheep, eating meat and drinking wine: “Let’s eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die.” <sup>14</sup>The LORD<sup><a href="#footnote-29" id="ref-29">†</a></sup> of Armies revealed himself in my ears, “Surely this iniquity will not be forgiven you until you die,” says the Lord, GOD of Armies.</p><p>

Yes, he will grasp you firmly. <sup>18</sup>He will surely wind you around and around, and throw you like a ball into a large country. There you will die, and there the chariots of your glory will be, you disgrace of your lord’s house. <sup>19</sup>I will thrust you from your office. You will be pulled down from your station.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    It will happen in that day that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, <sup>21</sup>and I will clothe him with your robe, and strengthen him with your belt. I will commit your government into his hand; and he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah. <sup>22</sup>I will lay the key of David’s house on his shoulder. He will open, and no one will shut. He will shut, and no one will open. <sup>23</sup>I will fasten him like a nail in a sure place. He will be for a throne of glory to his father’s house. <sup>24</sup>They will hang on him all the glory of his father’s house, the offspring and the issue, every small vessel, from the cups even to all the pitchers. <sup>25</sup>“In that day,” says the LORD of Armies, “the nail that was fastened in a sure place will give way.

From the land of Kittim it is revealed to them. <sup>2</sup>Be still, you inhabitants of the coast, you whom the merchants of Sidon that pass over the sea have replenished. <sup>3</sup>On great waters, the seed of the Shihor, the harvest of the Nile, was her revenue. She was the market of nations. <sup>4</sup>Be ashamed, Sidon; for the sea has spoken, the stronghold of the sea, saying, “I have not travailed, nor given birth, neither have I nourished young men, nor brought up virgins.” <sup>5</sup>When the report comes to Egypt, they will be in anguish at the report of Tyre. <sup>6</sup>Pass over to Tarshish! Wail, you inhabitants of the coast! <sup>7</sup>Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days, whose feet carried her far away to travel?</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    Who has planned this against Tyre, the giver of crowns, whose merchants are princes, whose traders are the honourable of the earth? <sup>9</sup>The LORD of Armies has planned it, to stain the pride of all glory, to bring into contempt all the honourable of the earth. <sup>10</sup>Pass through your land like the Nile, daughter of Tarshish. There is no restraint any more. <sup>11</sup>He has stretched out his hand over the sea. He has shaken the kingdoms. The LORD has ordered the destruction of Canaan’s strongholds. <sup>12</sup>He said, “You shall rejoice no more, you oppressed virgin daughter of Sidon. Arise, pass over to Kittim. Even there you will have no rest.”</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    Behold, the land of the Chaldeans. This people didn’t exist. The Assyrians founded it for those who dwell in the wilderness. They set up their towers. They overthrew its palaces. They made it a ruin. <sup>14</sup>Howl, you ships of Tarshish, for your stronghold is laid waste! <sup>15</sup>It will come to pass in that day that Tyre will be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king. After the end of seventy years it will be to Tyre like in the song of the prostitute. <sup>16</sup>Take a harp; go about the city, you prostitute that has been forgotten. Make sweet melody. Sing many songs, that you may be remembered. <sup>17</sup>It will happen after the end of seventy years that the LORD will visit Tyre. She will return to her wages, and will play the prostitute with all the kingdoms of the world on the surface of the earth. <sup>18</sup>Her merchandise and her wages will be holiness to the LORD. It will not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise will be for those who dwell before the LORD, to eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.</p><a href="#Isaiah-c-24"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-24">24</h3></a>

    Behold, the LORD makes the earth empty, makes it waste, turns it upside down, and scatters its inhabitants. <sup>2</sup>It will be as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the creditor, so with the debtor; as with the taker of interest, so with the giver of interest. <sup>3</sup>The earth will be utterly emptied and utterly laid waste; for the LORD has spoken this word. <sup>4</sup>The earth mourns and fades away. The world languishes and fades away. The lofty people of the earth languish. <sup>5</sup>The earth also is polluted under its inhabitants, because they have transgressed the laws, violated the statutes, and broken the everlasting covenant. <sup>6</sup>Therefore the curse has devoured the earth, and those who dwell therein are found guilty. Therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burnt, and few men are left. <sup>7</sup>The new wine mourns. The vine languishes. All the merry-hearted sigh. <sup>8</sup>The mirth of tambourines ceases. The sound of those who rejoice ends. The joy of the harp ceases. <sup>9</sup>They will not drink wine with a song. Strong drink will be bitter to those who drink it. <sup>10</sup>The confused city is broken down. Every house is shut up, that no man may come in. <sup>11</sup>There is a crying in the streets because of the wine. All joy is darkened. The mirth of the land is gone. <sup>12</sup>The city is left in desolation, and the gate is struck with destruction. <sup>13</sup>For it will be so within the earth amongst the peoples, as the shaking of an olive tree, as the gleanings when the vintage is done.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    These shall lift up their voice. They will shout for the majesty of the LORD. They cry aloud from the sea. <sup>15</sup>Therefore glorify the LORD in the east, even the name of the LORD, the God of Israel, in the islands of the sea! <sup>16</sup>From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs. Glory to the righteous!</p><p>
    But I said, “I pine away! I pine away! woe is me!” The treacherous have dealt treacherously. Yes, the treacherous have dealt very treacherously. <sup>17</sup>Fear, the pit, and the snare are on you who inhabit the earth. <sup>18</sup>It will happen that he who flees from the noise of the fear will fall into the pit; and he who comes up out of the middle of the pit will be taken in the snare; for the windows on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth tremble. <sup>19</sup>The earth is utterly broken. The earth is torn apart. The earth is shaken violently. <sup>20</sup>The earth will stagger like a drunken man, and will sway back and forth like a hammock. Its disobedience will be heavy on it, and it will fall and not rise again.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    It will happen in that day that the LORD will punish the army of the high ones on high, and the kings of the earth on the earth. <sup>22</sup>They will be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and will be shut up in the prison; and after many days they will be visited. <sup>23</sup>Then the moon will be confounded, and the sun ashamed; for the LORD of Armies will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem; and glory will be before his elders.</p><a href="#Isaiah-c-25"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-25">25</h3></a>

    <sup>1</sup>
    The LORD, you are my God. I will exalt you! I will praise your name, for you have done wonderful things, things planned long ago, in complete faithfulness and truth. <sup>2</sup>For you have made a city into a heap, a fortified city into a ruin, a palace of strangers to be no city. It will never be built. <sup>3</sup>Therefore a strong people will glorify you. A city of awesome nations will fear you. <sup>4</sup>For you have been a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the blast of the dreaded ones is like a storm against the wall. <sup>5</sup>As the heat in a dry place you will bring down the noise of strangers; as the heat by the shade of a cloud, the song of the dreaded ones will be brought low.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    In this mountain, the LORD of Armies will make all peoples a feast of choice meat,<sup><a href="#footnote-30" id="ref-30">†</a></sup> a feast of choice wines, of choice meat full of marrow, of well refined choice wines. <sup>7</sup>He will destroy in this mountain the surface of the covering that covers all peoples, and the veil that is spread over all nations. <sup>8</sup>He has swallowed up death forever! The Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces. He will take the reproach of his people away from off all the earth, for the LORD has spoken it.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    It shall be said in that day, “Behold, this is our God! We have waited for him, and he will save us! This is the LORD! We have waited for him. We will be glad and rejoice in his salvation!” <sup>10</sup>For the LORD’s hand will rest in this mountain.</p><p>
    Moab will be trodden down in his place, even like straw is trodden down in the water of the dunghill. <sup>11</sup>He will spread out his hands in the middle of it, like one who swims spreads out hands to swim, but his pride will be humbled together with the craft of his hands. <sup>12</sup>He has brought the high fortress of your walls down, laid low, and brought to the ground, even to the dust.</p><a href="#Isaiah-c-26"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-26">26</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    In that day, this song will be sung in the land of Judah:</p><p>“We have a strong city.</p><p>God appoints salvation for walls and bulwarks.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    Open the gates, that the righteous nation may enter:</p><p>
    the one which keeps faith.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    You will keep whoever’s mind is steadfast in perfect peace,</p><p>
    because he trusts in you.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Trust in the LORD<sup><a href="#footnote-31" id="ref-31">†</a></sup> forever;</p><p>
    for in the LORD,<sup><a href="#footnote-32" id="ref-32">†</a></sup> the LORD, is an everlasting Rock.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    For he has brought down those who dwell on high, the lofty city.</p><p>
    He lays it low.</p><p>
    He lays it low even to the ground.</p><p>
    He brings it even to the dust.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    The foot shall tread it down,</p><p>even the feet of the poor</p><p>
    and the steps of the needy.”</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    The way of the just is uprightness.</p><p>You who are upright make the path of the righteous level.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Yes, in the way of your judgements, LORD, we have waited for you.</p><p>
    Your name and your renown are the desire of our soul.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    With my soul I have desired you in the night.</p><p>
    Yes, with my spirit within me I will seek you earnestly;</p><p>
    for when your judgements are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Let favour be shown to the wicked,</p><p>
    yet he will not learn righteousness.</p><p>
    In the land of uprightness he will deal wrongfully,</p><p>
    and will not see the LORD’s majesty.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    LORD, your hand is lifted up, yet they don’t see;</p><p>
    but they will see your zeal for the people and be disappointed.</p><p>
    Yes, fire will consume your adversaries.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    LORD, you will ordain peace for us,</p><p>
    for you have also done all our work for us.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    LORD our God, other lords besides you have had dominion over us,</p><p>
    but we will only acknowledge your name.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    The dead shall not live.</p><p>
    The departed spirits shall not rise.</p><p>
    Therefore you have visited and destroyed them,</p><p>
    and caused all memory of them to perish.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    You have increased the nation, O LORD.</p><p>
    You have increased the nation!</p><p>
    You are glorified!</p><p>
    You have enlarged all the borders of the land.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    LORD, in trouble they have visited you.</p><p>
    They poured out a prayer when your chastening was on them.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Just as a woman with child, who draws near the time of her delivery,</p><p>
    is in pain and cries out in her pangs,</p><p>
    so we have been before you, LORD.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    We have been with child.</p><p>
    We have been in pain.</p><p>
    We gave birth, it seems, only to wind.</p><p>
    We have not worked any deliverance in the earth;</p><p>
    neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    Your dead shall live.</p><p>
    Their dead bodies shall arise.</p><p>
    Awake and sing, you who dwell in the dust;</p><p>
    for your dew is like the dew of herbs,</p><p>
    and the earth will cast out the departed spirits.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    Come, my people, enter into your rooms,</p><p>
    and shut your doors behind you.</p><p>
    Hide yourself for a little moment,</p><p>
    until the indignation is past.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    For, behold, the LORD comes out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity.</p><p>
    The earth also will disclose her blood, and will no longer cover her slain.</p><a href="#Isaiah-c-27"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-27">27</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    In that day, the LORD with his hard and great and strong sword will punish leviathan, the fleeing serpent, and leviathan, the twisted serpent; and he will kill the dragon that is in the sea.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    In that day, sing to her, “A pleasant vineyard! <sup>3</sup>I, the LORD, am its keeper. I will water it every moment. Lest anyone damage it, I will keep it night and day. <sup>4</sup>Wrath is not in me, but if I should find briers and thorns, I would do battle! I would march on them and I would burn them together. <sup>5</sup>Or else let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me. Let him make peace with me.”</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    In days to come, Jacob will take root. Israel will blossom and bud. They will fill the surface of the world with fruit. <sup>7</sup>Has he struck them as he struck those who struck them? Or are they killed like those who killed them were killed? <sup>8</sup>In measure, when you send them away, you contend with them. He has removed them with his rough blast in the day of the east wind. <sup>9</sup>Therefore by this the iniquity of Jacob will be forgiven, and this is all the fruit of taking away his sin: that he makes all the stones of the altar as chalk stones that are beaten in pieces, so that the Asherah poles and the incense altars shall rise no more. <sup>10</sup>For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness. The calf will feed there, and there he will lie down, and consume its branches. <sup>11</sup>When its boughs are withered, they will be broken off. The women will come and set them on fire, for they are a people of no understanding. Therefore he who made them will not have compassion on them, and he who formed them will show them no favour.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    It will happen in that day that the LORD will thresh from the flowing stream of the Euphrates to the brook of Egypt; and you will be gathered one by one, children of Israel.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    It will happen in that day that a great trumpet will be blown; and those who were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and those who were outcasts in the land of Egypt, shall come; and they will worship the LORD in the holy mountain at Jerusalem.</p><a href="#Isaiah-c-28"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-28">28</h3></a>

    Woe to the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim, and to the fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fertile valley of those who are overcome with wine! <sup>2</sup>Behold, the Lord has one who is mighty and strong. Like a storm of hail, a destroying storm, and like a storm of mighty waters overflowing, he will cast them down to the earth with his hand. <sup>3</sup>The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim will be trodden under foot. <sup>4</sup>The fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fertile valley, shall be like the first-ripe fig before the summer, which someone picks and eats as soon as he sees it. <sup>5</sup>In that day, the LORD of Armies will become a crown of glory and a diadem of beauty to the residue of his people, <sup>6</sup>and a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgement, and strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    They also reel with wine, and stagger with strong drink. The priest and the prophet reel with strong drink. They are swallowed up by wine. They stagger with strong drink. They err in vision. They stumble in judgement. <sup>8</sup>For all tables are completely full of filthy vomit and filthiness.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    Whom will he teach knowledge? To whom will he explain the message? Those who are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts? <sup>10</sup>For it is precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, there a little.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    But he will speak to this nation with stammering lips and in another language, <sup>12</sup>to whom he said, “This is the resting place. Give rest to the weary,” and “This is the refreshing;” yet they would not hear. <sup>13</sup>Therefore the LORD’s word will be to them precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, there a little; that they may go, fall backward, be broken, be snared, and be taken.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    Therefore hear the LORD’s word, you scoffers, that rule this people in Jerusalem: <sup>15</sup>“Because you have said, ‘We have made a covenant with death, and we are in agreement with Sheol.<sup><a href="#footnote-33" id="ref-33">†</a></sup> When the overflowing scourge passes through, it won’t come to us; for we have made lies our refuge, and we have hidden ourselves under falsehood.’” <sup>16</sup>Therefore the Lord GOD says, “Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone of a sure foundation. He who believes shall not act hastily. <sup>17</sup>I will make justice the measuring line, and righteousness the plumb line. The hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters will overflow the hiding place. <sup>18</sup>Your covenant with death shall be annulled, and your agreement with Sheol<sup><a href="#footnote-34" id="ref-34">†</a></sup> shall not stand. When the overflowing scourge passes through, then you will be trampled down by it. <sup>19</sup>As often as it passes through, it will seize you; for morning by morning it will pass through, by day and by night; and it will be nothing but terror to understand the message.” <sup>20</sup>For the bed is too short to stretch out on, and the blanket is too narrow to wrap oneself in. <sup>21</sup>For the LORD will rise up as on Mount Perazim. He will be angry as in the valley of Gibeon; that he may do his work, his unusual work, and bring to pass his act, his extraordinary act. <sup>22</sup>Now therefore don’t be scoffers, lest your bonds be made strong; for I have heard a decree of destruction from the Lord, GOD<sup><a href="#footnote-35" id="ref-35">†</a></sup> of Armies, on the whole earth.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    Give ear, and hear my voice! Listen, and hear my speech! <sup>24</sup>Does he who ploughs to sow plough continually? Does he keep turning the soil and breaking the clods? <sup>25</sup>When he has levelled its surface, doesn’t he plant the dill, and scatter the cumin seed, and put in the wheat in rows, the barley in the appointed place, and the spelt in its place? <sup>26</sup>For his God instructs him in right judgement and teaches him. <sup>27</sup>For the dill isn’t threshed with a sharp instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned over the cumin; but the dill is beaten out with a stick, and the cumin with a rod. <sup>28</sup>Bread flour must be ground; so he will not always be threshing it. Although he drives the wheel of his threshing cart over it, his horses don’t grind it. <sup>29</sup>This also comes out from the LORD of Armies, who is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in wisdom.</p><a href="#Isaiah-c-29"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-29">29</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Woe to Ariel! Ariel, the city where David encamped! Add year to year; let the feasts come around; <sup>2</sup>then I will distress Ariel, and there will be mourning and lamentation. She shall be to me as an altar hearth.<sup><a href="#footnote-36" id="ref-36">†</a></sup> <sup>3</sup>I will encamp against you all around you, and will lay siege against you with posted troops. I will raise siege works against you. <sup>4</sup>You will be brought down, and will speak out of the ground. Your speech will mumble out of the dust. Your voice will be as of one who has a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and your speech will whisper out of the dust.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    But the multitude of your foes will be like fine dust, and the multitude of the ruthless ones like chaff that blows away. Yes, it will be in an instant, suddenly. <sup>6</sup>She will be visited by the LORD of Armies with thunder, with earthquake, with great noise, with whirlwind and storm, and with the flame of a devouring fire. <sup>7</sup>The multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all who fight against her and her stronghold, and who distress her, will be like a dream, a vision of the night. <sup>8</sup>It will be like when a hungry man dreams, and behold, he eats; but he awakes, and his hunger isn’t satisfied; or like when a thirsty man dreams, and behold, he drinks; but he awakes, and behold, he is faint, and he is still thirsty. The multitude of all the nations that fight against Mount Zion will be like that.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Pause and wonder! Blind yourselves and be blind! They are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink. <sup>10</sup>For the LORD has poured out on you a spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes, the prophets; and he has covered your heads, the seers. <sup>11</sup>All vision has become to you like the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one who is educated, saying, “Read this, please;” and he says, “I can’t, for it is sealed;” <sup>12</sup>and the book is delivered to one who is not educated, saying, “Read this, please;” and he says, “I can’t read.”</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    The Lord said, “Because this people draws near with their mouth and honours me with their lips, but they have removed their heart far from me, and their fear of me is a commandment of men which has been taught; <sup>14</sup>therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work amongst this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder; and the wisdom of their wise men will perish, and the understanding of their prudent men will be hidden.”</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    Woe to those who deeply hide their counsel from the LORD, and whose deeds are in the dark, and who say, “Who sees us?” and “Who knows us?” <sup>16</sup>You turn things upside down! Should the potter be thought to be like clay, that the thing made should say about him who made it, “He didn’t make me;” or the thing formed say of him who formed it, “He has no understanding”?</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>Isn’t it yet a very little while, and Lebanon will be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field will be regarded as a forest? <sup>18</sup>In that day, the deaf will hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind will see out of obscurity and out of darkness. <sup>19</sup>The humble also will increase their joy in the LORD, and the poor amongst men will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. <sup>20</sup>For the ruthless is brought to nothing, and the scoffer ceases, and all those who are alert to do evil are cut off— <sup>21</sup>who cause a person to be indicted by a word, and lay a snare for one who reproves in the gate, and who deprive the innocent of justice with false testimony.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    Therefore the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, says concerning the house of Jacob: “Jacob shall no longer be ashamed, neither shall his face grow pale. <sup>23</sup>But when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in the middle of him, they will sanctify my name. Yes, they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and will stand in awe of the God of Israel. <sup>24</sup>They also who err in spirit will come to understanding, and those who grumble will receive instruction.”</p><a href="#Isaiah-c-30"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-30">30</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>“Woe to the rebellious children”, says the LORD, “who take counsel, but not from me; and who make an alliance, but not with my Spirit, that they may add sin to sin; <sup>2</sup>who set out to go down into Egypt without asking for my advice, to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to take refuge in the shadow of Egypt! <sup>3</sup>Therefore the strength of Pharaoh will be your shame, and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt your confusion. <sup>4</sup>For their princes are at Zoan, and their ambassadors have come to Hanes. <sup>5</sup>They shall all be ashamed because of a people that can’t profit them, that are not a help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.”</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    The burden of the animals of the South.</p><p>
    Through the land of trouble and anguish, of the lioness and the lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they carry their riches on the shoulders of young donkeys, and their treasures on the humps of camels, to an unprofitable people. <sup>7</sup>For Egypt helps in vain, and to no purpose; therefore I have called her Rahab who sits still. <sup>8</sup>Now go, write it before them on a tablet, and inscribe it in a book, that it may be for the time to come forever and ever. <sup>9</sup>For it is a rebellious people, lying children, children who will not hear the LORD’s law; <sup>10</sup>who tell the seers, “Don’t see!” and the prophets, “Don’t prophesy to us right things. Tell us pleasant things. Prophesy deceits. <sup>11</sup>Get out of the way. Turn away from the path. Cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.” <sup>12</sup>Therefore the Holy One of Israel says, “Because you despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and rely on it, <sup>13</sup>therefore this iniquity shall be to you like a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking comes suddenly in an instant. <sup>14</sup>He will break it as a potter’s vessel is broken, breaking it in pieces without sparing, so that there won’t be found amongst the broken pieces a piece good enough to take fire from the hearth, or to dip up water out of the cistern.”</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    For thus said the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel, “You will be saved in returning and rest. Your strength will be in quietness and in confidence.” You refused, <sup>16</sup>but you said, “No, for we will flee on horses;” therefore you will flee; and, “We will ride on the swift;” therefore those who pursue you will be swift. <sup>17</sup>One thousand will flee at the threat of one. At the threat of five, you will flee until you are left like a beacon on the top of a mountain, and like a banner on a hill.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    Therefore the LORD will wait, that he may be gracious to you; and therefore he will be exalted, that he may have mercy on you, for the LORD is a God of justice. Blessed are all those who wait for him. <sup>19</sup>For the people will dwell in Zion at Jerusalem. You will weep no more. He will surely be gracious to you at the voice of your cry. When he hears you, he will answer you. <sup>20</sup>Though the Lord may give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet your teachers won’t be hidden any more, but your eyes will see your teachers; <sup>21</sup>and when you turn to the right hand, and when you turn to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, “This is the way. Walk in it.” <sup>22</sup>You shall defile the overlaying of your engraved images of silver, and the plating of your molten images of gold. You shall cast them away as an unclean thing. You shall tell it, “Go away!”</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    He will give the rain for your seed, with which you will sow the ground; and bread of the increase of the ground will be rich and plentiful. In that day, your livestock will feed in large pastures. <sup>24</sup>The oxen likewise and the young donkeys that till the ground will eat savoury feed, which has been winnowed with the shovel and with the fork. <sup>25</sup>There will be brooks and streams of water on every lofty mountain and on every high hill in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall. <sup>26</sup>Moreover the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times brighter, like the light of seven days, in the day that the LORD binds up the fracture of his people, and heals the wound they were struck with.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>
    Behold, the LORD’s name comes from far away, burning with his anger, and in thick rising smoke. His lips are full of indignation. His tongue is as a devouring fire. <sup>28</sup>His breath is as an overflowing stream that reaches even to the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction. A bridle that leads to ruin will be in the jaws of the peoples. <sup>29</sup>You will have a song, as in the night when a holy feast is kept, and gladness of heart, as when one goes with a flute to come to the LORD’s mountain, to Israel’s Rock. <sup>30</sup>The LORD will cause his glorious voice to be heard, and will show the descent of his arm, with the indignation of his anger and the flame of a devouring fire, with a blast, storm, and hailstones. <sup>31</sup>For through the LORD’s voice the Assyrian will be dismayed. He will strike him with his rod. <sup>32</sup>Every stroke of the rod of punishment, which the LORD will lay on him, will be with the sound of tambourines and harps. He will fight with them in battles, brandishing weapons. <sup>33</sup>For his burning place has long been ready. Yes, it is prepared for the king. He has made its pyre deep and large with fire and much wood. The LORD’s breath, like a stream of sulphur, kindles it.</p><a href="#Isaiah-c-31"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-31">31</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help,</p><p>
    and rely on horses,</p><p>
    and trust in chariots because they are many,</p><p>
    and in horsemen because they are very strong,</p><p>
    but they don’t look to the Holy One of Israel,</p><p>
    and they don’t seek the LORD!</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    Yet he also is wise, and will bring disaster,</p><p>
    and will not call back his words, but will arise against the house of the evildoers,</p><p>
    and against the help of those who work iniquity.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    Now the Egyptians are men, and not God;</p><p>
    and their horses flesh, and not spirit.</p><p>
    When the LORD stretches out his hand, both he who helps shall stumble,</p><p>
    and he who is helped shall fall,</p><p>
    and they all shall be consumed together.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    For the LORD says to me,</p><p>“As the lion and the young lion growling over his prey,</p><p>
    if a multitude of shepherds is called together against him,</p><p>
    will not be dismayed at their voice,</p><p>
    nor abase himself for their noise,</p><p>
    so the LORD of Armies will come down to fight on Mount Zion and on its heights.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    As birds hovering, so the LORD of Armies will protect Jerusalem.</p><p>
    He will protect and deliver it.</p><p>
    He will pass over and preserve it.”</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    Return to him from whom you have deeply revolted, children of Israel. <sup>7</sup>For in that day everyone shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold—sin which your own hands have made for you.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>“The Assyrian will fall by the sword, not of man;</p><p>
    and the sword, not of mankind, shall devour him.</p><p>
    He will flee from the sword,</p><p>
    and his young men will become subject to forced labour.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    His rock will pass away by reason of terror,</p><p>
    and his princes will be afraid of the banner,”</p><p>
    says the LORD, whose fire is in Zion,</p><p>
    and his furnace in Jerusalem.</p><a href="#Isaiah-c-32"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-32">32</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness,</p><p>
    and princes shall rule in justice.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    A man shall be as a hiding place from the wind,</p><p>
    and a covert from the storm,</p><p>
    as streams of water in a dry place,</p><p>
    as the shade of a large rock in a weary land.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    The eyes of those who see will not be dim,</p><p>
    and the ears of those who hear will listen.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    The heart of the rash will understand knowledge,</p><p>
    and the tongue of the stammerers will be ready to speak plainly.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    The fool will no longer be called noble,</p><p>
    nor the scoundrel be highly respected.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    For the fool will speak folly,</p><p>
    and his heart will work iniquity,</p><p>
    to practise profanity,</p><p>

    The work of righteousness will be peace,</p><p>

<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Now in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all of the fortified cities of Judah and captured them. <sup>2</sup>The king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to King Hezekiah with a large army. He stood by the aqueduct from the upper pool in the fuller’s field highway. <sup>3</sup>Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph the recorder came out to him.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    Rabshakeh said to them, “Now tell Hezekiah, ‘The great king, the king of Assyria, says, “What confidence is this in which you trust? <sup>5</sup>I say that your counsel and strength for the war are only vain words. Now in whom do you trust, that you have rebelled against me? <sup>6</sup>Behold, you trust in the staff of this bruised reed, even in Egypt, which if a man leans on it, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him. <sup>7</sup>But if you tell me, ‘We trust in the LORD our God,’ isn’t that he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, ‘You shall worship before this altar’?” <sup>8</sup>Now therefore, please make a pledge to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them. <sup>9</sup>How then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put your trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? <sup>10</sup>Have I come up now without the LORD against this land to destroy it? The LORD said to me, “Go up against this land, and destroy it.”’”</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    Then Eliakim, Shebna and Joah said to Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. Don’t speak to us in the Jews’ language in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.”</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    But Rabshakeh said, “Has my master sent me only to your master and to you, to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, who will eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?” <sup>13</sup>Then Rabshakeh stood, and called out with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and said, “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria! <sup>14</sup>The king says, ‘Don’t let Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you. <sup>15</sup>Don’t let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, “The LORD will surely deliver us. This city won’t be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.”’ <sup>16</sup>Don’t listen to Hezekiah, for the king of Assyria says, ‘Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and each of you eat from his vine, and each one from his fig tree, and each one of you drink the waters of his own cistern; <sup>17</sup>until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards. <sup>18</sup>Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, “The LORD will deliver us.” Have any of the gods of the nations delivered their lands from the hand of the king of Assyria? <sup>19</sup>Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they delivered Samaria from my hand? <sup>20</sup>Who are they amongst all the gods of these countries that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?’”</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    But they remained silent, and said nothing in reply, for the king’s commandment was, “Don’t answer him.”</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.</p><a href="#Isaiah-c-37"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-37">37</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    When King Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the LORD’s house. <sup>2</sup>He sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz. <sup>3</sup>They said to him, “Hezekiah says, ‘Today is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of rejection; for the children have come to the birth, and there is no strength to give birth. <sup>4</sup>It may be the LORD your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which the LORD your God has heard. Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.’”</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    Isaiah said to them, “Tell your master, ‘The LORD says, “Don’t be afraid of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me. <sup>7</sup>Behold, I will put a spirit in him and he will hear news, and will return to his own land. I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.”’”</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah, for he heard that he had departed from Lachish. <sup>9</sup>He heard news concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, “He has come out to fight against you.” When he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, <sup>10</sup>“Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, ‘Don’t let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, “Jerusalem won’t be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.” <sup>11</sup>Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly. Shall you be delivered? <sup>12</sup>Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the children of Eden who were in Telassar? <sup>13</sup>Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?’”</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it. Then Hezekiah went up to the LORD’s house, and spread it before the LORD. <sup>15</sup>Hezekiah prayed to the LORD, saying, <sup>16</sup>“LORD of Armies, the God of Israel, who is enthroned amongst the cherubim, you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth. <sup>17</sup>Turn your ear, LORD, and hear. Open your eyes, LORD, and behold. Hear all of the words of Sennacherib, who has sent to defy the living God. <sup>18</sup>Truly, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed all the countries and their land, <sup>19</sup>and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them. <sup>20</sup>Now therefore, LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you are the LORD, even you only.”</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “The LORD, the God of Israel says, ‘Because you have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, <sup>22</sup>this is the word which the LORD has spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion has despised you and ridiculed you. The daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you. <sup>23</sup>Whom have you defied and blasphemed? Against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high? Against the Holy One of Israel. <sup>24</sup>By your servants, you have defied the Lord, and have said, “With the multitude of my chariots I have come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon. I will cut down its tall cedars and its choice cypress trees. I will enter into its farthest height, the forest of its fruitful field. <sup>25</sup>I have dug and drunk water, and with the sole of my feet I will dry up all the rivers of Egypt.”</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>“‘Have you not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it in ancient times? Now I have brought it to pass, that it should be yours to destroy fortified cities, turning them into ruinous heaps. <sup>27</sup>Therefore their inhabitants had little power. They were dismayed and confounded. They were like the grass of the field, and like the green herb, like the grass on the housetops, and like a field before its crop has grown. <sup>28</sup>But I know your sitting down, your going out, your coming in, and your raging against me. <sup>29</sup>Because of your raging against me, and because your arrogance has come up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in your nose and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>“‘This shall be the sign to you: You will eat this year that which grows of itself, and in the second year that which springs from it; and in the third year sow and reap and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit. <sup>31</sup>The remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah will again take root downward, and bear fruit upward. <sup>32</sup>For out of Jerusalem a remnant will go out, and survivors will escape from Mount Zion. The zeal of the LORD of Armies will perform this.’</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>“Therefore the LORD says concerning the king of Assyria, ‘He will not come to this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither will he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it. <sup>34</sup>He will return the way that he came, and he won’t come to this city,’ says the LORD. <sup>35</sup>‘For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.’”</p><p>
    <sup>36</sup>
    Then the LORD’s angel went out and struck one hundred and eighty-five thousand men in the camp of the Assyrians. When men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies. <sup>37</sup>So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, went away, returned to Nineveh, and stayed there. <sup>38</sup>As he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons struck him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. Esar Haddon his son reigned in his place.</p><a href="#Isaiah-c-38"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-38">38</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    In those days Hezekiah was sick and near death. Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to him, and said to him, “The LORD<sup><a href="#footnote-38" id="ref-38">†</a></sup> says, ‘Set your house in order, for you will die, and not live.’”</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD, <sup>3</sup>and said, “Remember now, LORD, I beg you, how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your sight.” Then Hezekiah wept bitterly.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    Then the LORD’s word came to Isaiah, saying, <sup>5</sup>“Go, and tell Hezekiah, ‘The LORD, the God of David your father, says, “I have heard your prayer. I have seen your tears. Behold, I will add fifteen years to your life. <sup>6</sup>I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city. <sup>7</sup>This shall be the sign to you from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he has spoken. <sup>8</sup>Behold, I will cause the shadow on the sundial, which has gone down on the sundial of Ahaz with the sun, to return backward ten steps.”’” So the sun returned ten steps on the sundial on which it had gone down.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and had recovered of his sickness:</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    I said, “In the middle of my life I go into the gates of Sheol.<sup><a href="#footnote-39" id="ref-39">†</a></sup></p><p>
    I am deprived of the residue of my years.”</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    I said, “I won’t see the LORD,<sup><a href="#footnote-40" id="ref-40">†</a></sup></p><p>
    the LORD<sup><a href="#footnote-41" id="ref-41">†</a></sup> in the land of the living.</p><p>
    I will see man no more with the inhabitants of the world.</p><p>

    Now Isaiah had said, “Let them take a cake of figs, and lay it for a poultice on the boil, and he shall recover.” <sup>22</sup>Hezekiah also had said, “What is the sign that I will go up to the LORD’s house?”</p><a href="#Isaiah-c-39"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-39">39</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    At that time, Merodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that he had been sick, and had recovered. <sup>2</sup>Hezekiah was pleased with them, and showed them the house of his precious things, the silver, the gold, the spices, and the precious oil, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah didn’t show them. <sup>3</sup>Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah, and asked him, “What did these men say? From where did they come to you?”</p><p>
    Hezekiah said, “They have come from a country far from me, even from Babylon.”</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    Then he asked, “What have they seen in your house?”</p><p>
    Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house. There is nothing amongst my treasures that I have not shown them.”</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the LORD of Armies: <sup>6</sup>‘Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have stored up until today, will be carried to Babylon. Nothing will be left,’ says the LORD. <sup>7</sup>‘They will take away your sons who will issue from you, whom you shall father, and they will be eunuchs in the king of Babylon’s palace.’”</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The LORD’s word which you have spoken is good.” He said moreover, “For there will be peace and truth in my days.”</p><a href="#Isaiah-c-40"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-40">40</h3></a>

    The voice of one who calls out,</p><p>“Prepare the way of the LORD in the wilderness!</p><p>

    The voice of one saying, “Cry out!”</p><p>
    One said, “What shall I cry?”</p><p>“All flesh is like grass,</p><p>

    <sup>7</sup>
    The grass withers,</p><p>
    the flower fades,</p><p>

    <sup>1</sup>“Hear this, house of Jacob,</p><p>
    you who are called by the name of Israel,</p><p>
    and have come out of the waters of Judah.</p><p>
    You swear by the LORD’s name,</p><p>
    and make mention of the God of Israel,</p><p>
    but not in truth, nor in righteousness—</p><p>

    for they call themselves citizens of the holy city,</p><p>

    the LORD of Armies is his name.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    I have declared the former things from of old.</p><p>Yes, they went out of my mouth, and I revealed them.</p><p>

    Because I knew that you are obstinate,</p><p>

    and your brow bronze;</p><p>

    therefore I have declared it to you from of old;</p><p>
    before it came to pass I showed it to you;</p><p>
    lest you should say, ‘My idol has done them.</p><p>
    My engraved image and my molten image has commanded them.’</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    You have heard it.</p><p>
    Now see all this.</p><p>

    <sup>7</sup>
    They are created now, and not from of old.</p><p>
    Before today, you didn’t hear them,</p><p>

    <sup>8</sup>
    Yes, you didn’t hear.</p><p>
    Yes, you didn’t know.</p><p>
    Yes, from of old your ear was not opened,</p><p>
    for I knew that you dealt very treacherously,</p><p>
    and were called a transgressor from the womb.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    For my name’s sake, I will defer my anger,</p><p>
    and for my praise, I hold it back for you</p><p>
    so that I don’t cut you off.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    Behold, I have refined you,</p><p>

    I have chosen you in the furnace of affliction.</p><p>

    For my own sake,</p><p>

    Your offspring also would have been as the sand</p><p>

    <sup>21</sup>
    They didn’t thirst when he led them through the deserts.</p><p>
    He caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them.</p><p>
    He also split the rock and the waters gushed out.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>“There is no peace”, says the LORD, “for the wicked.”</p><a href="#Isaiah-c-49"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-49">49</h3></a>

    <sup>1</sup>
    Listen, islands, to me.</p><p>
    Listen, you peoples, from afar:</p><p>
    the LORD has called me from the womb;</p><p>
    from the inside of my mother, he has mentioned my name.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    He has made my mouth like a sharp sword.</p><p>
    He has hidden me in the shadow of his hand.</p><p>
    He has made me a polished shaft.</p><p>
    He has kept me close in his quiver.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    He said to me, “You are my servant,</p><p>
    Israel, in whom I will be glorified.”</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    But I said, “I have laboured in vain.</p><p>
    I have spent my strength in vain for nothing;</p><p>
    yet surely the justice due to me is with the LORD,</p><p>
    and my reward with my God.”</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Now the LORD, he who formed me from the womb to be his servant,</p><p>says to bring Jacob again to him,</p><p>
    and to gather Israel to him,</p><p>
    for I am honourable in the LORD’s eyes,</p><p>
    and my God has become my strength.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    Indeed, he says, “It is too light a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob,</p><p>
    and to restore the preserved of Israel.</p><p>
    I will also give you as a light to the nations,</p><p>
    that you may be my salvation to the end of the earth.”</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    The LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One,</p><p>
    says to him whom man despises, to him whom the nation abhors, to a servant of rulers:</p><p>“Kings shall see and rise up,</p><p>
    princes, and they shall worship,</p><p>
    because of the LORD who is faithful, even the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.”</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    The LORD says, “I have answered you in an acceptable time.</p><p>
    I have helped you in a day of salvation.</p><p>
    I will preserve you and give you for a covenant of the people,</p><p>
    to raise up the land, to make them inherit the desolate heritage,</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>saying to those who are bound, ‘Come out!’;</p><p>
    to those who are in darkness, ‘Show yourselves!’</p><p>“They shall feed along the paths,</p><p>
    and their pasture shall be on all treeless heights.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    They shall not hunger nor thirst;</p><p>
    neither shall the heat nor sun strike them,</p><p>
    for he who has mercy on them will lead them.</p><p>
    He will guide them by springs of water.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    I will make all my mountains a road,</p><p>
    and my highways shall be exalted.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    Behold, these shall come from afar,</p><p>
    and behold, these from the north and from the west,</p><p>
    and these from the land of Sinim.”</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    Sing, heavens, and be joyful, earth!</p><p>
    Break out into singing, mountains!</p><p>
    For the LORD has comforted his people,</p><p>
    and will have compassion on his afflicted.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    But Zion said, “The LORD has forsaken me,</p><p>
    and the Lord has forgotten me.”</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>“Can a woman forget her nursing child,</p><p>
    that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb?</p><p>
    Yes, these may forget,</p><p>

    <sup>16</sup>
    Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands.</p><p>
    Your walls are continually before me.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    Your children hurry.</p><p>
    Your destroyers and those who devastated you will leave you.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    Lift up your eyes all around, and see:</p><p>
    all these gather themselves together, and come to you.</p><p>
    As I live,” says the LORD, “you shall surely clothe yourself with them all as with an ornament,</p><p>
    and dress yourself with them, like a bride.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>“For, as for your waste and your desolate places,</p><p>
    and your land that has been destroyed,</p><p>
    surely now that land will be too small for the inhabitants,</p><p>
    and those who swallowed you up will be far away.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    The children of your bereavement will say in your ears,</p><p>‘This place is too small for me.</p><p>
    Give me a place to live in.’</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>Then you will say in your heart, ‘Who has conceived these for me, since I have been bereaved of my children</p><p>
    and am alone, an exile, and wandering back and forth?</p><p>
    Who has brought these up?</p><p>
    Behold, I was left alone. Where were these?’”</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    The Lord GOD says, “Behold, I will lift up my hand to the nations,</p><p>
    and lift up my banner to the peoples.</p><p>
    They shall bring your sons in their bosom,</p><p>
    and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    Kings shall be your foster fathers,</p><p>
    and their queens your nursing mothers.</p><p>
    They will bow down to you with their faces to the earth,</p><p>
    and lick the dust of your feet.</p><p>
    Then you will know that I am the LORD;</p><p>
    and those who wait for me won’t be disappointed.”</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    Shall the plunder be taken from the mighty,</p><p>or the lawful captives be delivered?</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    But the LORD says, “Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away,</p><p>
    and the plunder retrieved from the fierce,</p><p>
    for I will contend with him who contends with you</p><p>
    and I will save your children.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    I will feed those who oppress you with their own flesh;</p><p>
    and they will be drunk on their own blood, as with sweet wine.</p><p>
    Then all flesh shall know that I, the LORD, am your Saviour</p><p>

    The LORD says, “Where is the bill of your mother’s divorce, with which I have put her away?</p><p>
    Or to which of my creditors have I sold you?</p><p>
    Behold, you were sold for your iniquities,</p><p>
    and your mother was put away for your transgressions.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    Why, when I came, was there no one?</p><p>
    When I called, why was there no one to answer?</p><p>
    Is my hand shortened at all, that it can’t redeem?</p><p>
    Or have I no power to deliver?</p><p>
    Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea.</p><p>
    I make the rivers a wilderness.</p><p>
    Their fish stink because there is no water, and die of thirst.</p><p>

    I clothe the heavens with blackness.</p><p>
    I make sackcloth their covering.”</p><p>

    he awakens my ear to hear as those who are taught.</p><p>

    The Lord GOD has opened my ear.</p><p>
    I was not rebellious.</p><p>
    I have not turned back.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    I gave my back to those who beat me,</p><p>

    He will divide the plunder with the strong,</p><p>

    <sup>15</sup>
    Yes, truth is lacking;</p><p>
    and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey.</p><p>
    The LORD saw it,</p><p>
    and it displeased him that there was no justice.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    He saw that there was no man,</p><p>
    and wondered that there was no intercessor.</p><p>
    Therefore his own arm brought salvation to him;</p><p>
    and his righteousness sustained him.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    He put on righteousness as a breastplate,</p><p>
    and a helmet of salvation on his head.</p><p>
    He put on garments of vengeance for clothing,</p><p>
    and was clad with zeal as a mantle.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    According to their deeds,</p><p>
    he will repay as appropriate:</p><p>
    wrath to his adversaries,</p><p>
    recompense to his enemies.</p><p>
    He will repay the islands their due.</p><p>

    In all their affliction he was afflicted,</p><p>

    Then he remembered the days of old,</p><p>

    <sup>20</sup>“No more will there be an infant who only lives a few days,</p><p>
    nor an old man who has not filled his days;</p><p>
    for the child will die one hundred years old,</p><p>
    and the sinner being one hundred years old will be accursed.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>They will build houses and inhabit them.</p><p>They will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    They will not build and another inhabit.</p><p>
    They will not plant and another eat;</p><p>
    for the days of my people will be like the days of a tree,</p><p>
    and my chosen will long enjoy the work of their hands.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    They will not labour in vain</p><p>
    nor give birth for calamity;</p><p>
    for they are the offspring of the LORD’s blessed</p><p>
    and their descendants with them.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    It will happen that before they call, I will answer;</p><p>
    and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    The wolf and the lamb will feed together.</p><p>
    The lion will eat straw like the ox.</p><p>
    Dust will be the serpent’s food.</p><p>
    They will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain,”</p><p>says the LORD.</p><a href="#Isaiah-c-66"><h3 id="Isaiah-c-66">66</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    The LORD says:</p><p>“Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool.</p><p>
    What kind of house will you build to me?</p><p>
    Where will I rest?</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    For my hand has made all these things,</p><p>
    and so all these things came to be,” says the LORD:</p><p>“but I will look to this man,</p><p>
    even to he who is poor and of a contrite spirit,</p><p>
    and who trembles at my word.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    He who kills an ox is as he who kills a man;</p><p>
    he who sacrifices a lamb, as he who breaks a dog’s neck;</p><p>
    he who offers an offering, as he who offers pig’s blood;</p><p>
    he who burns frankincense, as he who blesses an idol.</p><p>
    Yes, they have chosen their own ways,</p><p>
    and their soul delights in their abominations.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    I also will choose their delusions,</p><p>
    and will bring their fears on them,</p><p>
    because when I called, no one answered;</p><p>
    when I spoke, they didn’t listen,</p><p>
    but they did that which was evil in my eyes,</p><p>
    and chose that in which I didn’t delight.”</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Hear the LORD’s word,</p><p>
    you who tremble at his word:</p><p>“Your brothers who hate you,</p><p>
    who cast you out for my name’s sake, have said,</p><p>‘Let the LORD be glorified,</p><p>
    that we may see your joy;’</p><p>
    but it is those who shall be disappointed.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    A voice of tumult from the city,</p><p>
    a voice from the temple,</p><p>
    a voice of the LORD that repays his enemies what they deserve.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>“Before she travailed, she gave birth.</p><p>
    Before her pain came, she delivered a son.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    Who has heard of such a thing?</p><p>
    Who has seen such things?</p><p>
    Shall a land be born in one day?</p><p>
    Shall a nation be born at once?</p><p>
    For as soon as Zion travailed,</p><p>
    she gave birth to her children.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to be delivered?” says the LORD.</p><p>“Shall I who cause to give birth shut the womb?” says your God.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>“Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all you who love her.</p><p>
    Rejoice for joy with her, all you who mourn over her;</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    that you may nurse and be satisfied at the comforting breasts;</p><p>
    that you may drink deeply,</p><p>
    and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.”</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    For the LORD says, “Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river,</p><p>
    and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream,</p><p>
    and you will nurse.</p><p>
    You will be carried on her side,</p><p>
    and will be dandled on her knees.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    As one whom his mother comforts,</p><p>
    so I will comfort you.</p><p>
    You will be comforted in Jerusalem.”</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    You will see it, and your heart shall rejoice,</p><p>
    and your bones will flourish like the tender grass.</p><p>
    The LORD’s hand will be known amongst his servants;</p><p>
    and he will have indignation against his enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    For, behold, the LORD will come with fire,</p><p>
    and his chariots will be like the whirlwind;</p><p>
    to give his anger with fierceness,</p><p>
    and his rebuke with flames of fire.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    For the LORD will execute judgement by fire and by his sword on all flesh;</p><p>
    and those slain by the LORD will be many.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>“Those who sanctify themselves and purify themselves to go to the gardens, following one in the middle, eating pig’s meat, abominable things, and the mouse, they shall come to an end together,” says the LORD.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>“For I know their works and their thoughts. The time comes that I will gather all nations and languages, and they will come, and will see my glory.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>“I will set a sign amongst them, and I will send those who escape of them to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, who draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to far-away islands, who have not heard my fame, nor have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory amongst the nations. <sup>20</sup>They shall bring all your brothers out of all the nations for an offering to the LORD, on horses, in chariots, in litters, on mules, and on camels, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says the LORD, as the children of Israel bring their offering in a clean vessel into the LORD’s house. <sup>21</sup>Of them I will also select priests and Levites,” says the LORD.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>“For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me,” says the LORD, “so your offspring and your name shall remain. <sup>23</sup>It shall happen that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, all flesh will come to worship before me,” says the LORD. <sup>24</sup>“They will go out, and look at the dead bodies of the men who have transgressed against me; for their worm will not die, nor will their fire be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind.”</p><a href="#Isaiah-h">^</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-1">[1]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-2">[2]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-3">[3]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-4">[4]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-5">[5]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-6">[6]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-7">[7]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-8">[8]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-9">[9]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-10">[10]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-11">[11]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-12">[12]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-13">[13]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-14">[14]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-15">[15]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-16">[16]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-17">[17]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-18">[18]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-19">[19]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-20">[20]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-21">[21]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-22">[22]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-23">[23]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-24">[24]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-25">[25]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-26">[26]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-27">[27]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-28">[28]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-29">[29]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-30">[30]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-31">[31]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-32">[32]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-33">[33]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-34">[34]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-35">[35]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-36">[36]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-37">[37]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-38">[38]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-39">[39]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-40">[40]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-41">[41]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-42">[42]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-43">[43]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-44">[44]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-45">[45]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-46">[46]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-47">[47]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-48">[48]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-49">[49]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-50">[50]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-51">[51]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-52">[52]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-53">[53]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-54">[54]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-55">[55]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-56">[56]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-57">[57]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-58">[58]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-59">[59]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-60">[60]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-61">[61]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-62">[62]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-63">[63]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-64">[64]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-65">[65]</a> <a href="#Isaiah-c-66">[66]</a>
