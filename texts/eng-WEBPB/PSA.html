<p>BOOK 1</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Blessed is the man who doesn’t walk in the counsel of the wicked,</p><p>
    nor stand on the path of sinners,</p><p>
    nor sit in the seat of scoffers;</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    but his delight is in the LORD’s<sup><a href="#footnote-0" id="ref-0">†</a></sup> law.</p><p>
    On his law he meditates day and night.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water,</p><p>
    that produces its fruit in its season,</p><p>
    whose leaf also does not wither.</p><p>
    Whatever he does shall prosper.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    The wicked are not so,</p><p>
    but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgement,</p><p>
    nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    For the LORD knows the way of the righteous,</p><p>
    but the way of the wicked shall perish.</p><a href="#Psalms-c-2"><h3 id="Psalms-c-2">2</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Why do the nations rage,</p><p>
    and the peoples plot a vain thing?</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    The kings of the earth take a stand,</p><p>
    and the rulers take counsel together,</p><p>
    against the LORD, and against his Anointed,<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="ref-1">†</a></sup> saying,</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>“Let’s break their bonds apart,</p><p>
    and cast their cords from us.”</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    He who sits in the heavens will laugh.</p><p>
    The Lord<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="ref-2">†</a></sup> will have them in derision.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Then he will speak to them in his anger,</p><p>
    and terrify them in his wrath:</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>“Yet I have set my King on my holy hill of Zion.”</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    I will tell of the decree:</p><p>
    The LORD said to me, “You are my son.</p><p>
    Today I have become your father.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    Ask of me, and I will give the nations for your inheritance,</p><p>
    the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    You shall break them with a rod of iron.</p><p>
    You shall dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.”</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    Now therefore be wise, you kings.</p><p>
    Be instructed, you judges of the earth.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    Serve the LORD with fear,</p><p>
    and rejoice with trembling.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Give sincere homage to the Son,<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="ref-3">†</a></sup> lest he be angry, and you perish on the way,</p><p>
    for his wrath will soon be kindled.</p><p>Blessed are all those who take refuge in him.</p><a href="#Psalms-c-3"><h3 id="Psalms-c-3">3</h3></a>
<p>A Psalm by David, when he fled from Absalom his son.</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    LORD, how my adversaries have increased!</p><p>Many are those who rise up against me.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    Many there are who say of my soul,</p><p>“There is no help for him in God.”<sup><a href="#footnote-4" id="ref-4">†</a></sup> Selah.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    But you, LORD, are a shield around me,</p><p>
    my glory, and the one who lifts up my head.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    I cry to the LORD with my voice,</p><p>
    and he answers me out of his holy hill. Selah.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    I laid myself down and slept.</p><p>
    I awakened, for the LORD sustains me.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people</p><p>
    who have set themselves against me on every side.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Arise, LORD!</p><p>Save me, my God!</p><p>
    For you have struck all of my enemies on the cheek bone.</p><p>
    You have broken the teeth of the wicked.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    Salvation belongs to the LORD.</p><p>
    May your blessing be on your people. Selah.</p><a href="#Psalms-c-4"><h3 id="Psalms-c-4">4</h3></a>
<p>For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm by David.</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness.</p><p>Give me relief from my distress.</p><p>
    Have mercy on me, and hear my prayer.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    You sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonour?</p><p>
    Will you love vanity and seek after falsehood? Selah.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    But know that the LORD has set apart for himself him who is godly;</p><p>
    The LORD will hear when I call to him.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Stand in awe, and don’t sin.</p><p>Search your own heart on your bed, and be still. Selah.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Offer the sacrifices of righteousness.</p><p>Put your trust in the LORD.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Many say, “Who will show us any good?”</p><p>
    LORD, let the light of your face shine on us.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    You have put gladness in my heart,</p><p>
    more than when their grain and their new wine are increased.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    In peace I will both lay myself down and sleep,</p><p>
    for you alone, LORD, make me live in safety.</p><a href="#Psalms-c-5"><h3 id="Psalms-c-5">5</h3></a>
<p>For the Chief Musician, with the flutes. A Psalm by David.</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Give ear to my words, LORD.</p><p>Consider my meditation.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Listen to the voice of my cry, my King and my God,</p><p>
    for I pray to you.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    LORD, in the morning you will hear my voice.</p><p>
    In the morning I will lay my requests before you, and will watch expectantly.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    For you are not a God who has pleasure in wickedness.</p><p>Evil can’t live with you.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    The arrogant will not stand in your sight.</p><p>
    You hate all workers of iniquity.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    You will destroy those who speak lies.</p><p>
    The LORD abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    But as for me, in the abundance of your loving kindness I will come into your house.</p><p>
    I will bow towards your holy temple in reverence of you.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Lead me, LORD, in your righteousness because of my enemies.</p><p>Make your way straight before my face.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    For there is no faithfulness in their mouth.</p><p>
    Their heart is destruction.</p><p>
    Their throat is an open tomb.</p><p>
    They flatter with their tongue.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Hold them guilty, God.</p><p>Let them fall by their own counsels.</p><p>Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions,</p><p>
    for they have rebelled against you.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    But let all those who take refuge in you rejoice.</p><p>Let them always shout for joy, because you defend them.</p><p>Let them also who love your name be joyful in you.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    For you will bless the righteous.</p><p>
    LORD, you will surround him with favour as with a shield.</p><a href="#Psalms-c-6"><h3 id="Psalms-c-6">6</h3></a>
<p>For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments, upon the eight-stringed lyre. A Psalm by David.</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    LORD, don’t rebuke me in your anger,</p><p>neither discipline me in your wrath.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    Have mercy on me, LORD, for I am faint.</p><p>
    LORD, heal me, for my bones are troubled.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    My soul is also in great anguish.</p><p>
    But you, LORD—how long?</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Return, LORD. Deliver my soul,</p><p>
    and save me for your loving kindness’ sake.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    For in death there is no memory of you.</p><p>
    In Sheol,<sup><a href="#footnote-5" id="ref-5">†</a></sup> who shall give you thanks?</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    I am weary with my groaning.</p><p>
    Every night I flood my bed.</p><p>
    I drench my couch with my tears.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    My eye wastes away because of grief.</p><p>
    It grows old because of all my adversaries.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity,</p><p>
    for the LORD has heard the voice of my weeping.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    The LORD has heard my supplication.</p><p>
    The LORD accepts my prayer.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    May all my enemies be ashamed and dismayed.</p><p>
    They shall turn back, they shall be disgraced suddenly.</p><a href="#Psalms-c-7"><h3 id="Psalms-c-7">7</h3></a>
<p>A meditation by David, which he sang to the LORD, concerning the words of Cush, the Benjamite.</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    LORD, my God, I take refuge in you.</p><p>Save me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me,</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>lest they tear apart my soul like a lion,</p><p>ripping it in pieces, while there is no one to deliver.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    LORD, my God, if I have done this,</p><p>
    if there is iniquity in my hands,</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    if I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me</p><p>(yes, I have plundered him who without cause was my adversary),</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it;</p><p>yes, let him tread my life down to the earth,</p><p>
    and lay my glory in the dust. Selah.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Arise, LORD, in your anger.</p><p>Lift up yourself against the rage of my adversaries.</p><p>Awake for me. You have commanded judgement.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Let the congregation of the peoples surround you.</p><p>
    Rule over them on high.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    The LORD administers judgement to the peoples.</p><p>Judge me, LORD, according to my righteousness,</p><p>
    and to my integrity that is in me.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end,</p><p>
    but establish the righteous;</p><p>
    their minds and hearts are searched by the righteous God.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    My shield is with God,</p><p>
    who saves the upright in heart.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>God is a righteous judge,</p><p>yes, a God who has indignation every day.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>If a man doesn’t repent, he will sharpen his sword;</p><p>
    he has bent and strung his bow.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    He has also prepared for himself the instruments of death.</p><p>
    He makes ready his flaming arrows.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>Behold,<sup><a href="#footnote-6" id="ref-6">†</a></sup> he travails with iniquity.</p><p>Yes, he has conceived mischief,</p><p>
    and brought out falsehood.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    He has dug a hole,</p><p>
    and has fallen into the pit which he made.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    The trouble he causes shall return to his own head.</p><p>
    His violence shall come down on the crown of his own head.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    I will give thanks to the LORD according to his righteousness,</p><p>
    and will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.</p><a href="#Psalms-c-8"><h3 id="Psalms-c-8">8</h3></a>
<p>For the Chief Musician; on an instrument of Gath. A Psalm by David.</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    LORD, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!</p><p>
    You have set your glory above the heavens!</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    From the lips of babes and infants you have established strength,</p><p>
    because of your adversaries, that you might silence the enemy and the avenger.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers,</p><p>
    the moon and the stars, which you have ordained,</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    what is man, that you think of him?</p><p>
    What is the son of man, that you care for him?</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    For you have made him a little lower than the angels,<sup><a href="#footnote-7" id="ref-7">†</a></sup></p><p>
    and crowned him with glory and honour.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    You make him ruler over the works of your hands.</p><p>
    You have put all things under his feet:</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    All sheep and cattle,</p><p>yes, and the animals of the field,</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    the birds of the sky, the fish of the sea,</p><p>
    and whatever passes through the paths of the seas.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    LORD, our Lord,</p><p>how majestic is your name in all the earth!</p><a href="#Psalms-c-9"><h3 id="Psalms-c-9">9</h3></a>
<p>For the Chief Musician. Set to “The Death of the Son.” A Psalm by David.</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>I will give thanks to the LORD with my whole heart.</p><p>I will tell of all your marvellous works.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    I will be glad and rejoice in you.</p><p>
    I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>When my enemies turn back,</p><p>
    they stumble and perish in your presence.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    For you have maintained my just cause.</p><p>
    You sit on the throne judging righteously.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    You have rebuked the nations.</p><p>
    You have destroyed the wicked.</p><p>
    You have blotted out their name forever and ever.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    The enemy is overtaken by endless ruin.</p><p>
    The very memory of the cities which you have overthrown has perished.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    But the LORD reigns forever.</p><p>
    He has prepared his throne for judgement.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    He will judge the world in righteousness.</p><p>
    He will administer judgement to the peoples in uprightness.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    The LORD will also be a high tower for the oppressed;</p><p>
    a high tower in times of trouble.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    Those who know your name will put their trust in you,</p><p>
    for you, LORD, have not forsaken those who seek you.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Sing praises to the LORD, who dwells in Zion,</p><p>
    and declare amongst the people what he has done.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    For he who avenges blood remembers them.</p><p>
    He doesn’t forget the cry of the afflicted.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    Have mercy on me, LORD.</p><p>See my affliction by those who hate me,</p><p>
    and lift me up from the gates of death,</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    that I may show all of your praise.</p><p>
    I will rejoice in your salvation in the gates of the daughter of Zion.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    The nations have sunk down in the pit that they made.</p><p>
    In the net which they hid, their own foot is taken.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    The LORD has made himself known.</p><p>
    He has executed judgement.</p><p>
    The wicked is snared by the work of his own hands. Meditation. Selah.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    The wicked shall be turned back to Sheol,<sup><a href="#footnote-8" id="ref-8">†</a></sup></p><p>
    even all the nations that forget God.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    For the needy shall not always be forgotten,</p><p>nor the hope of the poor perish forever.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Arise, LORD! Don’t let man prevail.</p><p>
    Let the nations be judged in your sight.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    Put them in fear, LORD.</p><p>Let the nations know that they are only men. Selah.</p><a href="#Psalms-c-10"><h3 id="Psalms-c-10">10</h3></a>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Why do you stand far off, LORD?</p><p>
    Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    In arrogance, the wicked hunt down the weak.</p><p>
    They are caught in the schemes that they devise.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    For the wicked boasts of his heart’s cravings.</p><p>
    He blesses the greedy and condemns the LORD.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    The wicked, in the pride of his face,</p><p>
    has no room in his thoughts for God.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    His ways are prosperous at all times.</p><p>
    He is arrogant, and your laws are far from his sight.</p><p>
    As for all his adversaries, he sneers at them.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    He says in his heart, “I shall not be shaken.</p><p>
    For generations I shall have no trouble.”</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and oppression.</p><p>
    Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    He lies in wait near the villages.</p><p>
    From ambushes, he murders the innocent.</p><p>
    His eyes are secretly set against the helpless.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    He lurks in secret as a lion in his ambush.</p><p>
    He lies in wait to catch the helpless.</p><p>
    He catches the helpless when he draws him in his net.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    The helpless are crushed.</p><p>They collapse.</p><p>They fall under his strength.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    He says in his heart, “God has forgotten.</p><p>
    He hides his face.</p><p>
    He will never see it.”</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    Arise, LORD!</p><p>
    God, lift up your hand!</p><p>Don’t forget the helpless.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    Why does the wicked person condemn God,</p><p>
    and say in his heart, “God won’t call me into account”?</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    But you do see trouble and grief.</p><p>
    You consider it to take it into your hand.</p><p>
    You help the victim and the fatherless.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    Break the arm of the wicked.</p><p>
    As for the evil man, seek out his wickedness until you find none.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    The LORD is King forever and ever!</p><p>
    The nations will perish out of his land.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    LORD, you have heard the desire of the humble.</p><p>
    You will prepare their heart.</p><p>
    You will cause your ear to hear,</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    to judge the fatherless and the oppressed,</p><p>
    that man who is of the earth may terrify no more.</p><a href="#Psalms-c-11"><h3 id="Psalms-c-11">11</h3></a>
<p>For the Chief Musician. By David.</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    In the LORD, I take refuge.</p><p>How can you say to my soul, “Flee as a bird to your mountain”?</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    For, behold, the wicked bend their bows.</p><p>
    They set their arrows on the strings,</p><p>
    that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    If the foundations are destroyed,</p><p>
    what can the righteous do?</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    The LORD is in his holy temple.</p><p>
    The LORD is on his throne in heaven.</p><p>
    His eyes observe.</p><p>
    His eyes examine the children of men.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    The LORD examines the righteous,</p><p>
    but his soul hates the wicked and him who loves violence.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    On the wicked he will rain blazing coals;</p><p>fire, sulphur, and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    For the LORD is righteous.</p><p>
    He loves righteousness.</p><p>
    The upright shall see his face.</p><a href="#Psalms-c-12"><h3 id="Psalms-c-12">12</h3></a>
<p>For the Chief Musician; upon an eight-stringed lyre. A Psalm of David.</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Help, LORD; for the godly man ceases.</p><p>
    For the faithful fail from amongst the children of men.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Everyone lies to his neighbour.</p><p>
    They speak with flattering lips, and with a double heart.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    May the LORD cut off all flattering lips,</p><p>
    and the tongue that boasts,</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    who have said, “With our tongue we will prevail.</p><p>
    Our lips are our own.</p><p>
    Who is lord over us?”</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>“Because of the oppression of the weak and because of the groaning of the needy,</p><p>I will now arise,” says the LORD;</p><p>“I will set him in safety from those who malign him.”</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    The LORD’s words are flawless words,</p><p>
    as silver refined in a clay furnace, purified seven times.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>You will keep them, LORD.</p><p>You will preserve them from this generation forever.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    The wicked walk on every side,</p><p>
    when what is vile is exalted amongst the sons of men.</p><a href="#Psalms-c-13"><h3 id="Psalms-c-13">13</h3></a>
<p>For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>How long, LORD?</p><p>Will you forget me forever?</p><p>How long will you hide your face from me?</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    How long shall I take counsel in my soul,</p><p>having sorrow in my heart every day?</p><p>
    How long shall my enemy triumph over me?</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Behold, and answer me, LORD, my God.</p><p>
    Give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death;</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    lest my enemy say, “I have prevailed against him;”</p><p>
    lest my adversaries rejoice when I fall.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    But I trust in your loving kindness.</p><p>
    My heart rejoices in your salvation.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    I will sing to the LORD,</p><p>
    because he has been good to me.</p><a href="#Psalms-c-14"><h3 id="Psalms-c-14">14</h3></a>
<p>For the Chief Musician. By David.</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.”</p><p>
    They are corrupt.</p><p>
    They have done abominable deeds.</p><p>There is no one who does good.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    The LORD looked down from heaven on the children of men,</p><p>
    to see if there were any who understood,</p><p>
    who sought after God.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    They have all gone aside.</p><p>
    They have together become corrupt.</p><p>
    There is no one who does good, no, not one.</p><p>

    <sup>1</sup>
    LORD, who shall dwell in your sanctuary?</p><p>
    Who shall live on your holy hill?</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    He who walks blamelessly and does what is right,</p><p>
    and speaks truth in his heart;</p><p>

    he who doesn’t slander with his tongue,</p><p>

    in whose eyes a vile man is despised,</p><p>

    he who keeps an oath even when it hurts, and doesn’t change;</p><p>

    he who doesn’t lend out his money for usury,</p><p>
    nor take a bribe against the innocent.</p><p>
    He who does these things shall never be shaken.</p><a href="#Psalms-c-16"><h3 id="Psalms-c-16">16</h3></a>
<p>A Poem by David.</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Preserve me, God, for I take refuge in you.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    My soul, you have said to the LORD, “You are my Lord.</p><p>Apart from you I have no good thing.”</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    As for the saints who are in the earth,</p><p>
    they are the excellent ones in whom is all my delight.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    Their sorrows shall be multiplied who give gifts to another god.</p><p>
    Their drink offerings of blood I will not offer,</p><p>
    nor take their names on my lips.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    The LORD assigned my portion and my cup.</p><p>You made my lot secure.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places.</p><p>Yes, I have a good inheritance.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    I will bless the LORD, who has given me counsel.</p><p>Yes, my heart instructs me in the night seasons.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    I have set the LORD always before me.</p><p>
    Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    Therefore my heart is glad, and my tongue rejoices.</p><p>
    My body shall also dwell in safety.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    For you will not leave my soul in Sheol,<sup><a href="#footnote-9" id="ref-9">†</a></sup></p><p>
    neither will you allow your holy one to see corruption.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    You will show me the path of life.</p><p>
    In your presence is fullness of joy.</p><p>
    In your right hand there are pleasures forever more.</p><a href="#Psalms-c-17"><h3 id="Psalms-c-17">17</h3></a>
<p>A Prayer by David.</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Hear, LORD, my righteous plea.</p><p>
    Give ear to my prayer that doesn’t go out of deceitful lips.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Let my sentence come out of your presence.</p><p>Let your eyes look on equity.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    You have proved my heart.</p><p>
    You have visited me in the night.</p><p>
    You have tried me, and found nothing.</p><p>
    I have resolved that my mouth shall not disobey.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    As for the deeds of men, by the word of your lips,</p><p>
    I have kept myself from the ways of the violent.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    My steps have held fast to your paths.</p><p>
    My feet have not slipped.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    I have called on you, for you will answer me, God.</p><p>
    Turn your ear to me.</p><p>
    Hear my speech.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    Show your marvellous loving kindness,</p><p>
    you who save those who take refuge by your right hand from their enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    Keep me as the apple of your eye.</p><p>
    Hide me under the shadow of your wings,</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    from the wicked who oppress me,</p><p>
    my deadly enemies, who surround me.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    They close up their callous hearts.</p><p>
    With their mouth they speak proudly.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    They have now surrounded us in our steps.</p><p>
    They set their eyes to cast us down to the earth.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey,</p><p>
    as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    Arise, LORD, confront him.</p><p>
    Cast him down.</p><p>
    Deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword,</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    from men by your hand, LORD,</p><p>
    from men of the world, whose portion is in this life.</p><p>
    You fill the belly of your cherished ones.</p><p>
    Your sons have plenty,</p><p>
    and they store up wealth for their children.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    As for me, I shall see your face in righteousness.</p><p>
    I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with seeing your form.</p><a href="#Psalms-c-18"><h3 id="Psalms-c-18">18</h3></a>
<p>For the Chief Musician. By David the servant of the LORD, who spoke to the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul. He said,</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    I love you, LORD, my strength.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    The LORD is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer;</p><p>
    my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge;</p><p>
    my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    I call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised;</p><p>
    and I am saved from my enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    The cords of death surrounded me.</p><p>
    The floods of ungodliness made me afraid.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    The cords of Sheol<sup><a href="#footnote-10" id="ref-10">†</a></sup> were around me.</p><p>
    The snares of death came on me.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    In my distress I called on the LORD,</p><p>
    and cried to my God.</p><p>
    He heard my voice out of his temple.</p><p>
    My cry before him came into his ears.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    Then the earth shook and trembled.</p><p>
    The foundations also of the mountains quaked and were shaken,</p><p>
    because he was angry.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Smoke went out of his nostrils.</p><p>Consuming fire came out of his mouth.</p><p>Coals were kindled by it.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    He bowed the heavens also, and came down.</p><p>Thick darkness was under his feet.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    He rode on a cherub, and flew.</p><p>Yes, he soared on the wings of the wind.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    He made darkness his hiding place, his pavilion around him,</p><p>darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed,</p><p>hailstones and coals of fire.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    The LORD also thundered in the sky.</p><p>
    The Most High uttered his voice:</p><p>
    hailstones and coals of fire.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    He sent out his arrows, and scattered them.</p><p>
    He routed them with great lightning bolts.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    Then the channels of waters appeared.</p><p>
    The foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke, LORD,</p><p>
    at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    He sent from on high.</p><p>
    He took me.</p><p>
    He drew me out of many waters.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    He delivered me from my strong enemy,</p><p>
    from those who hated me; for they were too mighty for me.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    They came on me in the day of my calamity,</p><p>
    but the LORD was my support.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    He brought me out also into a large place.</p><p>
    He delivered me, because he delighted in me.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness.</p><p>According to the cleanness of my hands, he has recompensed me.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    For I have kept the ways of the LORD,</p><p>
    and have not wickedly departed from my God.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    For all his ordinances were before me.</p><p>
    I didn’t put away his statutes from me.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    I was also blameless with him.</p><p>
    I kept myself from my iniquity.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    Therefore the LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness,</p><p>according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    With the merciful you will show yourself merciful.</p><p>
    With the perfect man, you will show yourself perfect.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    With the pure, you will show yourself pure.</p><p>
    With the crooked you will show yourself shrewd.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>
    For you will save the afflicted people,</p><p>
    but the arrogant eyes you will bring down.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>
    For you will light my lamp, LORD.</p><p>
    My God will light up my darkness.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>
    For by you, I advance through a troop.</p><p>
    By my God, I leap over a wall.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>
    As for God, his way is perfect.</p><p>
    The LORD’s word is tried.</p><p>
    He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>
    For who is God, except the LORD?</p><p>
    Who is a rock, besides our God,</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>
    the God who arms me with strength, and makes my way perfect?</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>
    He makes my feet like deer’s feet,</p><p>
    and sets me on my high places.</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>
    He teaches my hands to war,</p><p>
    so that my arms bend a bow of bronze.</p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>
    You have also given me the shield of your salvation.</p><p>
    Your right hand sustains me.</p><p>
    Your gentleness has made me great.</p><p>
    <sup>36</sup>
    You have enlarged my steps under me,</p><p>
    My feet have not slipped.</p><p>
    <sup>37</sup>
    I will pursue my enemies, and overtake them.</p><p>
    I won’t turn away until they are consumed.</p><p>
    <sup>38</sup>
    I will strike them through, so that they will not be able to rise.</p><p>
    They shall fall under my feet.</p><p>
    <sup>39</sup>
    For you have armed me with strength to the battle.</p><p>
    You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.</p><p>
    <sup>40</sup>
    You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me,</p><p>
    that I might cut off those who hate me.</p><p>
    <sup>41</sup>
    They cried, but there was no one to save;</p><p>even to the LORD, but he didn’t answer them.</p><p>
    <sup>42</sup>
    Then I beat them small as the dust before the wind.</p><p>
    I cast them out as the mire of the streets.</p><p>
    <sup>43</sup>
    You have delivered me from the strivings of the people.</p><p>
    You have made me the head of the nations.</p><p>
    A people whom I have not known shall serve me.</p><p>
    <sup>44</sup>
    As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me.</p><p>
    The foreigners shall submit themselves to me.</p><p>
    <sup>45</sup>
    The foreigners shall fade away,</p><p>
    and shall come trembling out of their strongholds.</p><p>
    <sup>46</sup>
    The LORD lives! Blessed be my rock.</p><p>Exalted be the God of my salvation,</p><p>
    <sup>47</sup>
    even the God who executes vengeance for me,</p><p>
    and subdues peoples under me.</p><p>
    <sup>48</sup>
    He rescues me from my enemies.</p><p>Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up against me.</p><p>
    You deliver me from the violent man.</p><p>
    <sup>49</sup>Therefore I will give thanks to you, LORD, amongst the nations,</p><p>
    and will sing praises to your name.</p><p>

    There is no speech nor language</p><p>where their voice is not heard.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    Their voice has gone out through all the earth,</p><p>
    their words to the end of the world.</p><p>
    In them he has set a tent for the sun,</p><p>

    which is as a bridegroom coming out of his room,</p><p>

    The LORD’s precepts are right, rejoicing the heart.</p><p>
    The LORD’s commandment is pure, enlightening the eyes.</p><p>

    The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring forever.</p><p>
    The LORD’s ordinances are true, and righteous altogether.</p><p>

    <sup>3</sup>Though an army should encamp against me,</p><p>
    my heart shall not fear.</p><p>Though war should rise against me,</p><p>

    <sup>4</sup>
    One thing I have asked of the LORD, that I will seek after:</p><p>
    that I may dwell in the LORD’s house all the days of my life,</p><p>
    to see the LORD’s beauty,</p><p>
    and to enquire in his temple.</p><p>

    He will lift me up on a rock.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    Now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me.</p><p>
    I will offer sacrifices of joy in his tent.</p><p>

    <sup>7</sup>
    Hear, LORD, when I cry with my voice.</p><p>
    Have mercy also on me, and answer me.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    When you said, “Seek my face,”</p><p>
    my heart said to you, “I will seek your face, LORD.”</p><p>

    Lead me in a straight path, because of my enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Don’t deliver me over to the desire of my adversaries,</p><p>

    Give them according to the operation of their hands.</p><p>

    <sup>8</sup>
    Cease from anger, and forsake wrath.</p><p>Don’t fret; it leads only to evildoing.</p><p>

    For evildoers shall be cut off,</p><p>

    The Lord will laugh at him,</p><p>

    <sup>14</sup>
    The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow,</p><p>

    Their sword shall enter into their own heart.</p><p>

    Better is a little that the righteous has,</p><p>

    <sup>18</sup>
    The LORD knows the days of the perfect.</p><p>
    Their inheritance shall be forever.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    They shall not be disappointed in the time of evil.</p><p>
    In the days of famine they shall be satisfied.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    But the wicked shall perish.</p><p>
    The enemies of the LORD shall be like the beauty of the fields.</p><p>
    They will vanish—</p><p>
    vanish like smoke.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    The wicked borrow, and don’t pay back,</p><p>
    but the righteous give generously.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    For such as are blessed by him shall inherit the land.</p><p>
    Those who are cursed by him shall be cut off.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    A man’s steps are established by the LORD.</p><p>
    He delights in his way.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    Though he stumble, he shall not fall,</p><p>
    for the LORD holds him up with his hand.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    I have been young, and now am old,</p><p>
    yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken,</p><p>
    nor his children begging for bread.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    All day long he deals graciously, and lends.</p><p>
    His offspring is blessed.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>
    Depart from evil, and do good.</p><p>
    Live securely forever.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>
    For the LORD loves justice,</p><p>
    and doesn’t forsake his saints.</p><p>
    They are preserved forever,</p><p>
    but the children of the wicked shall be cut off.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>
    The righteous shall inherit the land,</p><p>

    <sup>30</sup>
    The mouth of the righteous talks of wisdom.</p><p>
    His tongue speaks justice.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>
    The law of his God is in his heart.</p><p>
    None of his steps shall slide.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>
    The wicked watch the righteous,</p><p>
    and seek to kill him.</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>
    The LORD will not leave him in his hand,</p><p>
    nor condemn him when he is judged.</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>
    Wait for the LORD, and keep his way,</p><p>
    and he will exalt you to inherit the land.</p><p>
    When the wicked are cut off, you shall see it.</p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>
    I have seen the wicked in great power,</p><p>
    spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil.</p><p>
    <sup>36</sup>
    But he passed away, and behold, he was not.</p><p>
    Yes, I sought him, but he could not be found.</p><p>

    Mark the perfect man, and see the upright,</p><p>

    The future of the wicked shall be cut off.</p><p>

    <sup>1</sup>Blessed is he who considers the poor.</p><p>
    The LORD will deliver him in the day of evil.</p><p>

    The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive.</p><p>

    The LORD will sustain him on his sickbed,</p><p>
    and restore him from his bed of illness.</p><p>

    I said, “LORD, have mercy on me!</p><p>
    Heal me, for I have sinned against you.”</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    My enemies speak evil against me:</p><p>“When will he die, and his name perish?”</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>If he comes to see me, he speaks falsehood.</p><p>
    His heart gathers iniquity to itself.</p><p>
    When he goes abroad, he tells it.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    All who hate me whisper together against me.</p><p>
    They imagine the worst for me.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>“An evil disease”, they say, “has afflicted him.</p><p>
    Now that he lies he shall rise up no more.”</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Yes, my own familiar friend, in whom I trusted,</p><p>
    who ate bread with me,</p><p>
    has lifted up his heel against me.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    But you, LORD, have mercy on me, and raise me up,</p><p>
    that I may repay them.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    By this I know that you delight in me,</p><p>
    because my enemy doesn’t triumph over me.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    As for me, you uphold me in my integrity,</p><p>
    and set me in your presence forever.</p><p>

    <sup>1</sup>We have heard with our ears, God;</p><p>our fathers have told us what work you did in their days,</p><p>
    in the days of old.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    You drove out the nations with your hand,</p><p>
    but you planted them.</p><p>
    You afflicted the peoples,</p><p>
    but you spread them abroad.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    For they didn’t get the land in possession by their own sword,</p><p>neither did their own arm save them;</p><p>
    but your right hand, your arm, and the light of your face,</p><p>
    because you were favourable to them.</p><p>

    <sup>5</sup>Through you, we will push down our adversaries.</p><p>Through your name, we will tread down those who rise up against us.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    For I will not trust in my bow,</p><p>neither will my sword save me.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    But you have saved us from our adversaries,</p><p>
    and have shamed those who hate us.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    In God we have made our boast all day long.</p><p>
    We will give thanks to your name forever. Selah.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    But now you rejected us, and brought us to dishonour,</p><p>
    and don’t go out with our armies.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    You make us turn back from the adversary.</p><p>
    Those who hate us take plunder for themselves.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    You have made us like sheep for food,</p><p>
    and have scattered us amongst the nations.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    You sell your people for nothing,</p><p>
    and have gained nothing from their sale.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    You make us a reproach to our neighbours,</p><p>
    a scoffing and a derision to those who are around us.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    You make us a byword amongst the nations,</p><p>
    a shaking of the head amongst the peoples.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>All day long my dishonour is before me,</p><p>
    and shame covers my face,</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    at the taunt of one who reproaches and verbally abuses,</p><p>
    because of the enemy and the avenger.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    All this has come on us,</p><p>yet we haven’t forgotten you.</p><p>We haven’t been false to your covenant.</p><p>

    Our heart has not turned back,</p><p>
    neither have our steps strayed from your path,</p><p>

    and covered us with the shadow of death.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    If we have forgotten the name of our God,</p><p>
    or spread out our hands to a strange god,</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>won’t God search this out?</p><p>
    For he knows the secrets of the heart.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    Yes, for your sake we are killed all day long.</p><p>
    We are regarded as sheep for the slaughter.</p><p>

    <sup>25</sup>
    For our soul is bowed down to the dust.</p><p>

    Your sons will take the place of your fathers.</p><p>
    You shall make them princes in all the earth.</p><p>

    Their inward thought is that their houses will endure forever,</p><p>

<p>For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba.</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Have mercy on me, God, according to your loving kindness.</p><p>According to the multitude of your tender mercies, blot out my transgressions.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity.</p><p>Cleanse me from my sin.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    For I know my transgressions.</p><p>
    My sin is constantly before me.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Against you, and you only, I have sinned,</p><p>
    and done that which is evil in your sight,</p><p>
    so you may be proved right when you speak,</p><p>
    and justified when you judge.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Behold, I was born in iniquity.</p><p>
    My mother conceived me in sin.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Behold, you desire truth in the inward parts.</p><p>
    You teach me wisdom in the inmost place.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean.</p><p>Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Let me hear joy and gladness,</p><p>
    that the bones which you have broken may rejoice.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Hide your face from my sins,</p><p>
    and blot out all of my iniquities.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Create in me a clean heart, O God.</p><p>Renew a right spirit within me.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Don’t throw me from your presence,</p><p>
    and don’t take your Holy Spirit from me.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    Restore to me the joy of your salvation.</p><p>Uphold me with a willing spirit.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    Then I will teach transgressors your ways.</p><p>Sinners will be converted to you.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God, the God of my salvation.</p><p>
    My tongue will sing aloud of your righteousness.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>Lord, open my lips.</p><p>
    My mouth will declare your praise.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    For you don’t delight in sacrifice, or else I would give it.</p><p>
    You have no pleasure in burnt offering.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit.</p><p>
    O God, you will not despise a broken and contrite heart.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>Do well in your good pleasure to Zion.</p><p>Build the walls of Jerusalem.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    Then you will delight in the sacrifices of righteousness,</p><p>
    in burnt offerings and in whole burnt offerings.</p><p>
    Then they will offer bulls on your altar.</p><a href="#Psalms-c-52"><h3 id="Psalms-c-52">52</h3></a>

    <sup>1</sup>Why do you boast of mischief, mighty man?</p><p>God’s loving kindness endures continually.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    Your tongue plots destruction,</p><p>
    like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    You love evil more than good,</p><p>lying rather than speaking the truth. Selah.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    You love all devouring words,</p><p>
    you deceitful tongue.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>God will likewise destroy you forever.</p><p>
    He will take you up, and pluck you out of your tent,</p><p>
    and root you out of the land of the living. Selah.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    The righteous also will see it, and fear,</p><p>
    and laugh at him, saying,</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>“Behold, this is the man who didn’t make God his strength,</p><p>
    but trusted in the abundance of his riches,</p><p>
    and strengthened himself in his wickedness.”</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in God’s house.</p><p>
    I trust in God’s loving kindness forever and ever.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    I will give you thanks forever, because you have done it.</p><p>

    They have become filthy together.</p><p>
    There is no one who does good, no, not one.</p><p>

    Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge,</p><p>
    who eat up my people as they eat bread,</p><p>
    and don’t call on God?</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    There they were in great fear, where no fear was,</p><p>
    for God has scattered the bones of him who encamps against you.</p><p>
    You have put them to shame,</p><p>because God has rejected them.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion!</p><p>

    <sup>5</sup>
    He will repay the evil to my enemies.</p><p>Destroy them in your truth.</p><p>

    With a free will offering, I will sacrifice to you.</p><p>
    I will give thanks to your name, LORD, for it is good.</p><p>

    For they bring suffering on me.</p><p>
    In anger they hold a grudge against me.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    My heart is severely pained within me.</p><p>
    The terrors of death have fallen on me.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Fearfulness and trembling have come on me.</p><p>Horror has overwhelmed me.</p><p>

    <sup>8</sup>“I would hurry to a shelter from the stormy wind and storm.”</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Confuse them, Lord, and confound their language,</p><p>for I have seen violence and strife in the city.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Day and night they prowl around on its walls.</p><p>Malice and abuse are also within her.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Destructive forces are within her.</p><p>Threats and lies don’t depart from her streets.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    For it was not an enemy who insulted me,</p><p>
    then I could have endured it.</p><p>
    Neither was it he who hated me who raised himself up against me,</p><p>
    then I would have hidden myself from him.</p><p>

    But it was you, a man like me,</p><p>
    my companion, and my familiar friend.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>We took sweet fellowship together.</p><p>We walked in God’s house with company.</p><p>

    <sup>17</sup>Evening, morning, and at noon, I will cry out in distress.</p><p>
    He will hear my voice.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    He has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me,</p><p>although there are many who oppose me.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>God, who is enthroned forever,</p><p>

    They never change</p><p>

    He raises his hands against his friends.</p><p>
    He has violated his covenant.</p><p>

    His mouth was smooth as butter,</p><p>but his heart was war.</p><p>

    I will come with the mighty acts of the Lord GOD.</p><p>
    I will make mention of your righteousness, even of yours alone.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>God, you have taught me from my youth.</p><p>
    Until now, I have declared your wondrous works.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    Yes, even when I am old and grey-haired, God, don’t forsake me,</p><p>
    until I have declared your strength to the next generation,</p><p>
    your might to everyone who is to come.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    God, your righteousness also reaches to the heavens.</p><p>
    You have done great things.</p><p>
    God, who is like you?</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    You, who have shown us many and bitter troubles,</p><p>
    you will let me live.</p><p>
    You will bring us up again from the depths of the earth.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    Increase my honour</p><p>
    and comfort me again.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    I will also praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, my God.</p><p>
    I sing praises to you with the lyre, Holy One of Israel.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    My lips shall shout for joy!</p><p>
    My soul, which you have redeemed, sings praises to you!</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    My tongue will also talk about your righteousness all day long,</p><p>
    for they are disappointed, and they are confounded,</p><p>
    who want to harm me.</p><a href="#Psalms-c-72"><h3 id="Psalms-c-72">72</h3></a>

    <sup>1</sup>
    God, give the king your justice;</p><p>
    your righteousness to the royal son.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    He will judge your people with righteousness,</p><p>
    and your poor with justice.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    The mountains shall bring prosperity to the people.</p><p>
    The hills bring the fruit of righteousness.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    He will judge the poor of the people.</p><p>
    He will save the children of the needy,</p><p>
    and will break the oppressor in pieces.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    They shall fear you while the sun endures;</p><p>
    and as long as the moon, throughout all generations.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    He will come down like rain on the mown grass,</p><p>
    as showers that water the earth.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    In his days, the righteous shall flourish,</p><p>
    and abundance of peace, until the moon is no more.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    He shall have dominion also from sea to sea,</p><p>
    from the River to the ends of the earth.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Those who dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him.</p><p>
    His enemies shall lick the dust.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    The kings of Tarshish and of the islands will bring tribute.</p><p>
    The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>Yes, all kings shall fall down before him.</p><p>
    All nations shall serve him.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    For he will deliver the needy when he cries;</p><p>
    the poor, who has no helper.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    He will have pity on the poor and needy.</p><p>
    He will save the souls of the needy.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    He will redeem their soul from oppression and violence.</p><p>
    Their blood will be precious in his sight.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    He will live; and Sheba’s gold will be given to him.</p><p>
    Men will pray for him continually.</p><p>
    They will bless him all day long.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    Abundance of grain shall be throughout the land.</p><p>
    Its fruit sways like Lebanon.</p><p>
    Let it flourish, thriving like the grass of the field.</p><p>

    His name endures forever.</p><p>
    His name continues as long as the sun.</p><p>
    Men shall be blessed by him.</p><p>
    All nations will call him blessed.</p><p>

<p>BOOK 3</p><p>A Psalm by Asaph.</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Surely God<sup><a href="#footnote-28" id="ref-28">†</a></sup> is good to Israel,</p><p>
    to those who are pure in heart.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>But as for me, my feet were almost gone.</p><p>
    My steps had nearly slipped.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    For I was envious of the arrogant,</p><p>
    when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    For there are no struggles in their death,</p><p>
    but their strength is firm.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    They are free from burdens of men,</p><p>
    neither are they plagued like other men.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    Therefore pride is like a chain around their neck.</p><p>
    Violence covers them like a garment.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    Their eyes bulge with fat.</p><p>
    Their minds pass the limits of conceit.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    They scoff and speak with malice.</p><p>
    In arrogance, they threaten oppression.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    They have set their mouth in the heavens.</p><p>
    Their tongue walks through the earth.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    Therefore their people return to them,</p><p>
    and they drink up waters of abundance.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    They say, “How does God know?</p><p>
    Is there knowledge in the Most High?”</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    Behold, these are the wicked.</p><p>Being always at ease, they increase in riches.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>Surely I have cleansed my heart in vain,</p><p>
    and washed my hands in innocence,</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    For all day long I have been plagued,</p><p>
    and punished every morning.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    If I had said, “I will speak thus”,</p><p>
    behold, I would have betrayed the generation of your children.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    When I tried to understand this,</p><p>
    it was too painful for me—</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    until I entered God’s sanctuary,</p><p>
    and considered their latter end.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    Surely you set them in slippery places.</p><p>You throw them down to destruction.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>How they are suddenly destroyed!</p><p>
    They are completely swept away with terrors.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>As a dream when one wakes up,</p><p>
    so, Lord,<sup><a href="#footnote-29" id="ref-29">†</a></sup> when you awake, you will despise their fantasies.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    For my soul was grieved.</p><p>
    I was embittered in my heart.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    I was so senseless and ignorant.</p><p>
    I was a brute beast before you.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>Nevertheless, I am continually with you.</p><p>
    You have held my right hand.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    You will guide me with your counsel,</p><p>
    and afterward receive me to glory.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    Whom do I have in heaven?</p><p>There is no one on earth whom I desire besides you.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    My flesh and my heart fails,</p><p>but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>
    For, behold, those who are far from you shall perish.</p><p>
    You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>
    But it is good for me to come close to God.</p><p>
    I have made the Lord GOD<sup><a href="#footnote-30" id="ref-30">†</a></sup> my refuge,</p><p>
    that I may tell of all your works.</p><a href="#Psalms-c-74"><h3 id="Psalms-c-74">74</h3></a>
<p>A contemplation by Asaph.</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>God, why have you rejected us forever?</p><p>
    Why does your anger smoulder against the sheep of your pasture?</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    Remember your congregation, which you purchased of old,</p><p>
    which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your inheritance:</p><p>
    Mount Zion, in which you have lived.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    Lift up your feet to the perpetual ruins,</p><p>
    all the evil that the enemy has done in the sanctuary.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    Your adversaries have roared in the middle of your assembly.</p><p>
    They have set up their standards as signs.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    They behaved like men wielding axes,</p><p>cutting through a thicket of trees.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    Now they break all its carved work down with hatchet and hammers.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    They have burnt your sanctuary to the ground.</p><p>
    They have profaned the dwelling place of your Name.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    They said in their heart, “We will crush them completely.”</p><p>
    They have burnt up all the places in the land where God was worshipped.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    We see no miraculous signs.</p><p>
    There is no longer any prophet,</p><p>
    neither is there amongst us anyone who knows how long.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    How long, God, shall the adversary reproach?</p><p>
    Shall the enemy blaspheme your name forever?</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    Why do you draw back your hand, even your right hand?</p><p>
    Take it from your chest and consume them!</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Yet God is my King of old,</p><p>
    working salvation throughout the earth.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    You divided the sea by your strength.</p><p>
    You broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    You broke the heads of Leviathan in pieces.</p><p>
    You gave him as food to people and desert creatures.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>You opened up spring and stream.</p><p>You dried up mighty rivers.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    The day is yours, the night is also yours.</p><p>
    You have prepared the light and the sun.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    You have set all the boundaries of the earth.</p><p>
    You have made summer and winter.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    Remember this, that the enemy has mocked you, LORD.</p><p>
    Foolish people have blasphemed your name.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Don’t deliver the soul of your dove to wild beasts.</p><p>Don’t forget the life of your poor forever.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>Honour your covenant,</p><p>
    for haunts of violence fill the dark places of the earth.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>Don’t let the oppressed return ashamed.</p><p>
    Let the poor and needy praise your name.</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    Arise, God! Plead your own cause.</p><p>
    Remember how the foolish man mocks you all day.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>Don’t forget the voice of your adversaries.</p><p>
    The tumult of those who rise up against you ascends continually.</p><a href="#Psalms-c-75"><h3 id="Psalms-c-75">75</h3></a>
<p>For the Chief Musician. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” A Psalm by Asaph. A song.</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>We give thanks to you, God.</p><p>We give thanks, for your Name is near.</p><p>Men tell about your wondrous works.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>When I choose the appointed time,</p><p>
    I will judge blamelessly.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    The earth and all its inhabitants quake.</p><p>
    I firmly hold its pillars. Selah.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    I said to the arrogant, “Don’t boast!”</p><p>
    I said to the wicked, “Don’t lift up the horn.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Don’t lift up your horn on high.</p><p>Don’t speak with a stiff neck.”</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    For neither from the east, nor from the west,</p><p>nor yet from the south, comes exaltation.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    But God is the judge.</p><p>
    He puts down one, and lifts up another.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    For in the LORD’s hand there is a cup,</p><p>full of foaming wine mixed with spices.</p><p>
    He pours it out.</p><p>
    Indeed the wicked of the earth drink and drink it to its very dregs.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    But I will declare this forever:</p><p>
    I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    I will cut off all the horns of the wicked,</p><p>
    but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.</p><a href="#Psalms-c-76"><h3 id="Psalms-c-76">76</h3></a>

    There he broke the flaming arrows of the bow,</p><p>
    the shield, and the sword, and the weapons of war. Selah.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Glorious are you, and excellent,</p><p>
    more than mountains of game.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>Valiant men lie plundered,</p><p>they have slept their last sleep.</p><p>None of the men of war can lift their hands.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    At your rebuke, God of Jacob,</p><p>
    both chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>You, even you, are to be feared.</p><p>Who can stand in your sight when you are angry?</p><p>

    You pronounced judgement from heaven.</p><p>
    The earth feared, and was silent,</p><p>

    when God arose to judgement,</p><p>
    to save all the afflicted ones of the earth. Selah.</p><p>

    Make vows to the LORD your God, and fulfil them!</p><p>Let all of his neighbours bring presents to him who is to be feared.</p><p>

    <sup>1</sup>
    My cry goes to God!</p><p>Indeed, I cry to God for help,</p><p>
    and for him to listen to me.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord.</p><p>
    My hand was stretched out in the night, and didn’t get tired.</p><p>
    My soul refused to be comforted.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    I remember God, and I groan.</p><p>
    I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. Selah.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    You hold my eyelids open.</p><p>
    I am so troubled that I can’t speak.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    I have considered the days of old,</p><p>
    the years of ancient times.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    I remember my song in the night.</p><p>
    I consider in my own heart;</p><p>
    my spirit diligently enquires:</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>“Will the Lord reject us forever?</p><p>
    Will he be favourable no more?</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Has his loving kindness vanished forever?</p><p>
    Does his promise fail for generations?</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    Has God forgotten to be gracious?</p><p>
    Has he, in anger, withheld his compassion?” Selah.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>Then I thought, “I will appeal to this:</p><p>
    the years of the right hand of the Most High.”</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    I will remember the LORD’s deeds;</p><p>
    for I will remember your wonders of old.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    I will also meditate on all your work,</p><p>
    and consider your doings.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    Your way, God, is in the sanctuary.</p><p>
    What god is great like God?</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    You are the God who does wonders.</p><p>
    You have made your strength known amongst the peoples.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    You have redeemed your people with your arm,</p><p>
    the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    The waters saw you, God.</p><p>
    The waters saw you, and they writhed.</p><p>
    The depths also convulsed.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    The clouds poured out water.</p><p>
    The skies resounded with thunder.</p><p>
    Your arrows also flashed around.</p><p>

    The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind.</p><p>
    The lightnings lit up the world.</p><p>
    The earth trembled and shook.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Your way was through the sea,</p><p>your paths through the great waters.</p><p>Your footsteps were not known.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>

<p>A contemplation by Asaph.</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>Hear my teaching, my people.</p><p>
    Turn your ears to the words of my mouth.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    I will open my mouth in a parable.</p><p>
    I will utter dark sayings of old,</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    which we have heard and known,</p><p>
    and our fathers have told us.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    We will not hide them from their children,</p><p>
    telling to the generation to come the praises of the LORD,</p><p>
    his strength, and his wondrous deeds that he has done.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    For he established a covenant in Jacob,</p><p>
    and appointed a teaching in Israel,</p><p>
    which he commanded our fathers,</p><p>
    that they should make them known to their children;</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    that the generation to come might know, even the children who should be born;</p><p>
    who should arise and tell their children,</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    that they might set their hope in God,</p><p>
    and not forget God’s deeds,</p><p>
    but keep his commandments,</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    and might not be as their fathers—</p><p>
    a stubborn and rebellious generation,</p><p>
    a generation that didn’t make their hearts loyal,</p><p>whose spirit was not steadfast with God.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows,</p><p>
    turned back in the day of battle.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    They didn’t keep God’s covenant,</p><p>
    and refused to walk in his law.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    They forgot his doings,</p><p>
    his wondrous deeds that he had shown them.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    He did marvellous things in the sight of their fathers,</p><p>
    in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    He split the sea, and caused them to pass through.</p><p>
    He made the waters stand as a heap.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    In the daytime he also led them with a cloud,</p><p>
    and all night with a light of fire.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    He split rocks in the wilderness,</p><p>
    and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    He brought streams also out of the rock,</p><p>
    and caused waters to run down like rivers.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    Yet they still went on to sin against him,</p><p>
    to rebel against the Most High in the desert.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    They tempted God in their heart</p><p>
    by asking food according to their desire.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>Yes, they spoke against God.</p><p>
    They said, “Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out,</p><p>
    and streams overflowed.</p><p>
    Can he give bread also?</p><p>
    Will he provide meat for his people?”</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    Therefore the LORD heard, and was angry.</p><p>
    A fire was kindled against Jacob,</p><p>
    anger also went up against Israel,</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    because they didn’t believe in God,</p><p>
    and didn’t trust in his salvation.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>Yet he commanded the skies above,</p><p>
    and opened the doors of heaven.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    He rained down manna on them to eat,</p><p>
    and gave them food from the sky.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>Man ate the bread of angels.</p><p>
    He sent them food to the full.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    He caused the east wind to blow in the sky.</p><p>
    By his power he guided the south wind.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>
    He also rained meat on them as the dust,</p><p>
    winged birds as the sand of the seas.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>
    He let them fall in the middle of their camp,</p><p>
    around their habitations.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>
    So they ate, and were well filled.</p><p>
    He gave them their own desire.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>
    They didn’t turn from their cravings.</p><p>
    Their food was yet in their mouths,</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>
    when the anger of God went up against them,</p><p>
    killed some of their strongest,</p><p>
    and struck down the young men of Israel.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>
    For all this they still sinned,</p><p>
    and didn’t believe in his wondrous works.</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>Therefore he consumed their days in vanity,</p><p>
    and their years in terror.</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>
    When he killed them, then they enquired after him.</p><p>They returned and sought God earnestly.</p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>
    They remembered that God was their rock,</p><p>
    the Most High God, their redeemer.</p><p>
    <sup>36</sup>But they flattered him with their mouth,</p><p>
    and lied to him with their tongue.</p><p>
    <sup>37</sup>
    For their heart was not right with him,</p><p>
    neither were they faithful in his covenant.</p><p>
    <sup>38</sup>
    But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn’t destroy them.</p><p>Yes, many times he turned his anger away,</p><p>
    and didn’t stir up all his wrath.</p><p>
    <sup>39</sup>
    He remembered that they were but flesh,</p><p>
    a wind that passes away, and doesn’t come again.</p><p>
    <sup>40</sup>
    How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness,</p><p>
    and grieved him in the desert!</p><p>
    <sup>41</sup>
    They turned again and tempted God,</p><p>
    and provoked the Holy One of Israel.</p><p>
    <sup>42</sup>
    They didn’t remember his hand,</p><p>
    nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;</p><p>
    <sup>43</sup>how he set his signs in Egypt,</p><p>
    his wonders in the field of Zoan,</p><p>
    <sup>44</sup>
    he turned their rivers into blood,</p><p>
    and their streams, so that they could not drink.</p><p>
    <sup>45</sup>
    He sent amongst them swarms of flies, which devoured them;</p><p>
    and frogs, which destroyed them.</p><p>
    <sup>46</sup>
    He also gave their increase to the caterpillar,</p><p>
    and their labour to the locust.</p><p>
    <sup>47</sup>He destroyed their vines with hail,</p><p>
    their sycamore fig trees with frost.</p><p>
    <sup>48</sup>He also gave over their livestock to the hail,</p><p>
    and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</p><p>
    <sup>49</sup>
    He threw on them the fierceness of his anger,</p><p>
    wrath, indignation, and trouble,</p><p>
    and a band of angels of evil.</p><p>
    <sup>50</sup>
    He made a path for his anger.</p><p>
    He didn’t spare their soul from death,</p><p>
    but gave their life over to the pestilence,</p><p>
    <sup>51</sup>
    and struck all the firstborn in Egypt,</p><p>
    the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.</p><p>
    <sup>52</sup>
    But he led out his own people like sheep,</p><p>
    and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</p><p>
    <sup>53</sup>
    He led them safely, so that they weren’t afraid,</p><p>
    but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</p><p>
    <sup>54</sup>
    He brought them to the border of his sanctuary,</p><p>
    to this mountain, which his right hand had taken.</p><p>
    <sup>55</sup>
    He also drove out the nations before them,</p><p>
    allotted them for an inheritance by line,</p><p>
    and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</p><p>
    <sup>56</sup>
    Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,</p><p>
    and didn’t keep his testimonies,</p><p>
    <sup>57</sup>but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers.</p><p>They were twisted like a deceitful bow.</p><p>
    <sup>58</sup>
    For they provoked him to anger with their high places,</p><p>
    and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.</p><p>
    <sup>59</sup>
    When God heard this, he was angry,</p><p>
    and greatly abhorred Israel,</p><p>
    <sup>60</sup>so that he abandoned the tent of Shiloh,</p><p>
    the tent which he placed amongst men,</p><p>
    <sup>61</sup>
    and delivered his strength into captivity,</p><p>
    his glory into the adversary’s hand.</p><p>
    <sup>62</sup>
    He also gave his people over to the sword,</p><p>
    and was angry with his inheritance.</p><p>
    <sup>63</sup>Fire devoured their young men.</p><p>
    Their virgins had no wedding song.</p><p>
    <sup>64</sup>
    Their priests fell by the sword,</p><p>
    and their widows couldn’t weep.</p><p>
    <sup>65</sup>Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep,</p><p>
    like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.</p><p>
    <sup>66</sup>
    He struck his adversaries backward.</p><p>
    He put them to a perpetual reproach.</p><p>
    <sup>67</sup>Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph,</p><p>
    and didn’t choose the tribe of Ephraim,</p><p>
    <sup>68</sup>But chose the tribe of Judah,</p><p>
    Mount Zion which he loved.</p><p>
    <sup>69</sup>
    He built his sanctuary like the heights,</p><p>
    like the earth which he has established forever.</p><p>
    <sup>70</sup>
    He also chose David his servant,</p><p>
    and took him from the sheepfolds;</p><p>
    <sup>71</sup>
    from following the ewes that have their young,</p><p>
    he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people,</p><p>
    and Israel, his inheritance.</p><p>
    <sup>72</sup>So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart,</p><p>
    and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.</p><a href="#Psalms-c-79"><h3 id="Psalms-c-79">79</h3></a>
<p>A Psalm by Asaph.</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>God, the nations have come into your inheritance.</p><p>
    They have defiled your holy temple.</p><p>
    They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.</p><p>

    the flesh of your saints to the animals of the earth.</p><p>

    They have shed their blood like water around Jerusalem.</p><p>There was no one to bury them.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>We have become a reproach to our neighbours,</p><p>

    Will your jealousy burn like fire?</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t know you,</p><p>
    on the kingdoms that don’t call on your name,</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    for they have devoured Jacob,</p><p>
    and destroyed his homeland.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Don’t hold the iniquities of our forefathers against us.</p><p>

    Help us, God of our salvation, for the glory of your name.</p><p>
    Deliver us, and forgive our sins, for your name’s sake.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?”</p><p>Let it be known amongst the nations, before our eyes,</p><p>
    that vengeance for your servants’ blood is being poured out.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    Let the sighing of the prisoner come before you.</p><p>According to the greatness of your power, preserve those who are sentenced to death.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    Pay back to our neighbours seven times into their bosom</p><p>
    their reproach with which they have reproached you, Lord.</p><p>

    Its boughs were like God’s cedars.</p><p>

    Your wrath lies heavily on me.</p><p>You have afflicted me with all your waves. Selah.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    You have taken my friends from me.</p><p>
    You have made me an abomination to them.</p><p>

    Do you show wonders to the dead?</p><p>

    Are your wonders made known in the dark?</p><p>
    Or your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?</p><p>

    LORD, why do you reject my soul?</p><p>Why do you hide your face from me?</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up.</p><p>
    While I suffer your terrors, I am distracted.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    Your fierce wrath has gone over me.</p><p>
    Your terrors have cut me off.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    They came around me like water all day long.</p><p>
    They completely engulfed me.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    You have put lover and friend far from me,</p><p>

    Before the mountains were born,</p><p>
    before you had formed the earth and the world,</p><p>
    even from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    You turn man to destruction, saying,</p><p>“Return, you children of men.”</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    For a thousand years in your sight are just like yesterday when it is past,</p><p>
    like a watch in the night.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    You sweep them away as they sleep.</p><p>
    In the morning they sprout like new grass.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    In the morning it sprouts and springs up.</p><p>
    By evening, it is withered and dry.</p><p>

    For we are consumed in your anger.</p><p>
    We are troubled in your wrath.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    You have set our iniquities before you,</p><p>
    our secret sins in the light of your presence.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    For all our days have passed away in your wrath.</p><p>
    We bring our years to an end as a sigh.</p><p>

    The days of our years are seventy,</p><p>

    <sup>8</sup>
    My enemies reproach me all day.</p><p>
    Those who are mad at me use my name as a curse.</p><p>

    for you have taken me up and thrown me away.</p><p>

    You will arise and have mercy on Zion,</p><p>

    so great is his loving kindness towards those who fear him.</p><p>

    so far has he removed our transgressions from us.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    Like a father has compassion on his children,</p><p>
    so the LORD has compassion on those who fear him.</p><p>

    As for man, his days are like grass.</p><p>
    As a flower of the field, so he flourishes.</p><p>

    Israel also came into Egypt.</p><p>
    Jacob lived in the land of Ham.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    He increased his people greatly,</p><p>
    and made them stronger than their adversaries.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    He turned their heart to hate his people,</p><p>
    to conspire against his servants.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    He sent Moses, his servant,</p><p>
    and Aaron, whom he had chosen.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>
    They performed miracles amongst them,</p><p>
    and wonders in the land of Ham.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>
    He sent darkness, and made it dark.</p><p>
    They didn’t rebel against his words.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>
    He turned their waters into blood,</p><p>
    and killed their fish.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>Their land swarmed with frogs,</p><p>even in the rooms of their kings.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>
    He spoke, and swarms of flies came,</p><p>
    and lice in all their borders.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>
    He gave them hail for rain,</p><p>
    with lightning in their land.</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>
    He struck their vines and also their fig trees,</p><p>
    and shattered the trees of their country.</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>He spoke, and the locusts came</p><p>with the grasshoppers, without number.</p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>
    They ate up every plant in their land,</p><p>
    and ate up the fruit of their ground.</p><p>
    <sup>36</sup>
    He struck also all the firstborn in their land,</p><p>
    the first fruits of all their manhood.</p><p>
    <sup>37</sup>
    He brought them out with silver and gold.</p><p>There was not one feeble person amongst his tribes.</p><p>
    <sup>38</sup>
    Egypt was glad when they departed,</p><p>
    for the fear of them had fallen on them.</p><p>
    <sup>39</sup>He spread a cloud for a covering,</p><p>fire to give light in the night.</p><p>
    <sup>40</sup>They asked, and he brought quails,</p><p>
    and satisfied them with the bread of the sky.</p><p>
    <sup>41</sup>
    He opened the rock, and waters gushed out.</p><p>They ran as a river in the dry places.</p><p>
    <sup>42</sup>
    For he remembered his holy word,</p><p>
    and Abraham, his servant.</p><p>
    <sup>43</sup>
    He brought his people out with joy,</p><p>
    his chosen with singing.</p><p>
    <sup>44</sup>
    He gave them the lands of the nations.</p><p>
    They took the labour of the peoples in possession,</p><p>
    <sup>45</sup>
    that they might keep his statutes,</p><p>
    and observe his laws.</p><p>

    or fully declare all his praise?</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>Blessed are those who keep justice.</p><p>Blessed is one who does what is right at all times.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    Remember me, LORD, with the favour that you show to your people.</p><p>
    Visit me with your salvation,</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    that I may see the prosperity of your chosen,</p><p>
    that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation,</p><p>
    that I may glory with your inheritance.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>We have sinned with our fathers.</p><p>We have committed iniquity.</p><p>We have done wickedly.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    Our fathers didn’t understand your wonders in Egypt.</p><p>
    They didn’t remember the multitude of your loving kindnesses,</p><p>
    but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake,</p><p>
    that he might make his mighty power known.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up;</p><p>so he led them through the depths, as through a desert.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    He saved them from the hand of him who hated them,</p><p>
    and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    The waters covered their adversaries.</p><p>
    There was not one of them left.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Then they believed his words.</p><p>
    They sang his praise.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    They soon forgot his works.</p><p>
    They didn’t wait for his counsel,</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>but gave in to craving in the desert,</p><p>
    and tested God in the wasteland.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    He gave them their request,</p><p>
    but sent leanness into their soul.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    They envied Moses also in the camp,</p><p>
    and Aaron, the LORD’s saint.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,</p><p>
    and covered the company of Abiram.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    A fire was kindled in their company.</p><p>
    The flame burnt up the wicked.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    They made a calf in Horeb,</p><p>
    and worshipped a molten image.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>Thus they exchanged their glory</p><p>
    for an image of a bull that eats grass.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>
    They forgot God, their Saviour,</p><p>
    who had done great things in Egypt,</p><p>
    <sup>22</sup>
    wondrous works in the land of Ham,</p><p>
    and awesome things by the Red Sea.</p><p>
    <sup>23</sup>
    Therefore he said that he would destroy them,</p><p>
    had Moses, his chosen, not stood before him in the breach,</p><p>
    to turn away his wrath, so that he wouldn’t destroy them.</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>Yes, they despised the pleasant land.</p><p>
    They didn’t believe his word,</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    but murmured in their tents,</p><p>
    and didn’t listen to the LORD’s voice.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>Therefore he swore to them</p><p>
    that he would overthrow them in the wilderness,</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>
    that he would overthrow their offspring amongst the nations,</p><p>
    and scatter them in the lands.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>They joined themselves also to Baal Peor,</p><p>
    and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>Thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds.</p><p>
    The plague broke in on them.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>
    Then Phinehas stood up and executed judgement,</p><p>
    so the plague was stopped.</p><p>
    <sup>31</sup>
    That was credited to him for righteousness,</p><p>
    for all generations to come.</p><p>
    <sup>32</sup>
    They angered him also at the waters of Meribah,</p><p>
    so that Moses was troubled for their sakes;</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>
    because they were rebellious against his spirit,</p><p>
    he spoke rashly with his lips.</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>
    They didn’t destroy the peoples,</p><p>
    as the LORD commanded them,</p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>but mixed themselves with the nations,</p><p>
    and learnt their works.</p><p>
    <sup>36</sup>
    They served their idols,</p><p>
    which became a snare to them.</p><p>
    <sup>37</sup>Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.</p><p>
    <sup>38</sup>
    They shed innocent blood,</p><p>even the blood of their sons and of their daughters,</p><p>whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan.</p><p>
    The land was polluted with blood.</p><p>
    <sup>39</sup>Thus they were defiled with their works,</p><p>
    and prostituted themselves in their deeds.</p><p>
    <sup>40</sup>
    Therefore the LORD burnt with anger against his people.</p><p>
    He abhorred his inheritance.</p><p>
    <sup>41</sup>
    He gave them into the hand of the nations.</p><p>
    Those who hated them ruled over them.</p><p>
    <sup>42</sup>
    Their enemies also oppressed them.</p><p>
    They were brought into subjection under their hand.</p><p>
    <sup>43</sup>He rescued them many times,</p><p>
    but they were rebellious in their counsel,</p><p>
    and were brought low in their iniquity.</p><p>
    <sup>44</sup>Nevertheless he regarded their distress,</p><p>
    when he heard their cry.</p><p>
    <sup>45</sup>
    He remembered for them his covenant,</p><p>
    and repented according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.</p><p>
    <sup>46</sup>
    He made them also to be pitied</p><p>
    by all those who carried them captive.</p><p>

    <sup>4</sup>
    They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way.</p><p>
    They found no city to live in.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Hungry and thirsty,</p><p>
    their soul fainted in them.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble,</p><p>
    and he delivered them out of their distresses.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    He led them also by a straight way,</p><p>

    <sup>10</sup>Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death,</p><p>being bound in affliction and iron,</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    because they rebelled against the words of God,<sup><a href="#footnote-56" id="ref-56">†</a></sup></p><p>
    and condemned the counsel of the Most High.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>Therefore he brought down their heart with labour.</p><p>
    They fell down, and there was no one to help.</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble,</p><p>
    and he saved them out of their distresses.</p><p>

    He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,</p><p>

    <sup>15</sup>Let them praise the LORD for his loving kindness,</p><p>
    for his wonderful deeds to the children of men!</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    For he has broken the gates of bronze,</p><p>

    <sup>17</sup>Fools are afflicted because of their disobedience,</p><p>
    and because of their iniquities.</p><p>
    <sup>18</sup>
    Their soul abhors all kinds of food.</p><p>
    They draw near to the gates of death.</p><p>
    <sup>19</sup>
    Then they cry to the LORD in their trouble,</p><p>
    and he saves them out of their distresses.</p><p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    He sends his word, and heals them,</p><p>
    and delivers them from their graves.</p><p>
    <sup>21</sup>Let them praise the LORD for his loving kindness,</p><p>

    Those who go down to the sea in ships,</p><p>
    who do business in great waters,</p><p>
    <sup>24</sup>
    these see the LORD’s deeds,</p><p>
    and his wonders in the deep.</p><p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    For he commands, and raises the stormy wind,</p><p>
    which lifts up its waves.</p><p>
    <sup>26</sup>
    They mount up to the sky; they go down again to the depths.</p><p>
    Their soul melts away because of trouble.</p><p>
    <sup>27</sup>
    They reel back and forth, and stagger like a drunken man,</p><p>
    and are at their wits’ end.</p><p>
    <sup>28</sup>
    Then they cry to the LORD in their trouble,</p><p>
    and he brings them out of their distress.</p><p>
    <sup>29</sup>He makes the storm a calm,</p><p>
    so that its waves are still.</p><p>
    <sup>30</sup>
    Then they are glad because it is calm,</p><p>

    <sup>32</sup>Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people,</p><p>
    and praise him in the seat of the elders.</p><p>
    <sup>33</sup>
    He turns rivers into a desert,</p><p>
    water springs into a thirsty ground,</p><p>
    <sup>34</sup>
    and a fruitful land into a salt waste,</p><p>
    for the wickedness of those who dwell in it.</p><p>
    <sup>35</sup>
    He turns a desert into a pool of water,</p><p>
    and a dry land into water springs.</p><p>
    <sup>36</sup>
    There he makes the hungry live,</p><p>
    that they may prepare a city to live in,</p><p>
    <sup>37</sup>
    sow fields, plant vineyards,</p><p>
    and reap the fruits of increase.</p><p>
    <sup>38</sup>
    He blesses them also, so that they are multiplied greatly.</p><p>
    He doesn’t allow their livestock to decrease.</p><p>
    <sup>39</sup>Again, they are diminished and bowed down</p><p>
    through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.</p><p>
    <sup>40</sup>
    He pours contempt on princes,</p><p>
    and causes them to wander in a trackless waste.</p><p>
    <sup>41</sup>Yet he lifts the needy out of their affliction,</p><p>
    and increases their families like a flock.</p><p>
    <sup>42</sup>
    The upright will see it, and be glad.</p><p>
    All the wicked will shut their mouths.</p><p>

    <sup>1</sup>
    LORD, remember David and all his affliction,</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>how he swore to the LORD,</p><p>
    and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>“Surely I will not come into the structure of my house,</p><p>nor go up into my bed;</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    I will not give sleep to my eyes,</p><p>or slumber to my eyelids,</p><p>

    a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.”</p><p>

    We found it in the field of Jaar.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>“We will go into his dwelling place.</p><p>We will worship at his footstool.”</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>
    Arise, LORD, into your resting place,</p><p>
    you, and the ark of your strength.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>Let your priests be clothed with righteousness.</p><p>Let your saints shout for joy!</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    For your servant David’s sake,</p><p>don’t turn away the face of your anointed one.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    The LORD has sworn to David in truth.</p><p>
    He will not turn from it:</p><p>“I will set the fruit of your body on your throne.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    If your children will keep my covenant,</p><p>
    my testimony that I will teach them,</p><p>
    their children also will sit on your throne forever more.”</p><p>
    <sup>13</sup>
    For the LORD has chosen Zion.</p><p>
    He has desired it for his habitation.</p><p>
    <sup>14</sup>“This is my resting place forever.</p><p>
    I will live here, for I have desired it.</p><p>
    <sup>15</sup>
    I will abundantly bless her provision.</p><p>
    I will satisfy her poor with bread.</p><p>
    <sup>16</sup>I will also clothe her priests with salvation.</p><p>
    Her saints will shout aloud for joy.</p><p>
    <sup>17</sup>
    I will make the horn of David to bud there.</p><p>
    I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.</p><p>

<p>A contemplation by David, when he was in the cave. A Prayer.</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    I cry with my voice to the LORD.</p><p>
    With my voice, I ask the LORD for mercy.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    I pour out my complaint before him.</p><p>
    I tell him my troubles.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>When my spirit was overwhelmed within me,</p><p>
    you knew my route.</p><p>
    On the path in which I walk,</p><p>
    they have hidden a snare for me.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>Look on my right, and see;</p><p>
    for there is no one who is concerned for me.</p><p>Refuge has fled from me.</p><p>
    No one cares for my soul.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    I cried to you, LORD.</p><p>
    I said, “You are my refuge,</p><p>
    my portion in the land of the living.”</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>Listen to my cry,</p><p>
    for I am in desperate need.</p><p>Deliver me from my persecutors,</p><p>
    for they are too strong for me.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Bring my soul out of prison,</p><p>
    that I may give thanks to your name.</p><p>
    The righteous will surround me,</p><p>
    for you will be good to me.</p><a href="#Psalms-c-143"><h3 id="Psalms-c-143">143</h3></a>
<p>A Psalm by David.</p><p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Hear my prayer, LORD.</p><p>
    Listen to my petitions.</p><p>
    In your faithfulness and righteousness, relieve me.</p><p>
    <sup>2</sup>Don’t enter into judgement with your servant,</p><p>
    for in your sight no man living is righteous.</p><p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    For the enemy pursues my soul.</p><p>
    He has struck my life down to the ground.</p><p>
    He has made me live in dark places, as those who have been long dead.</p><p>
    <sup>4</sup>
    Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed within me.</p><p>
    My heart within me is desolate.</p><p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    I remember the days of old.</p><p>
    I meditate on all your doings.</p><p>
    I contemplate the work of your hands.</p><p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    I spread out my hands to you.</p><p>
    My soul thirsts for you, like a parched land. Selah.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>Hurry to answer me, LORD.</p><p>
    My spirit fails.</p><p>Don’t hide your face from me,</p><p>
    so that I don’t become like those who go down into the pit.</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>Cause me to hear your loving kindness in the morning,</p><p>
    for I trust in you.</p><p>Cause me to know the way in which I should walk,</p><p>
    for I lift up my soul to you.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    Deliver me, LORD, from my enemies.</p><p>
    I flee to you to hide me.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    Teach me to do your will,</p><p>
    for you are my God.</p><p>
    Your Spirit is good.</p><p>
    Lead me in the land of uprightness.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    Revive me, LORD, for your name’s sake.</p><p>
    In your righteousness, bring my soul out of trouble.</p><p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    In your loving kindness, cut off my enemies,</p><p>
    and destroy all those who afflict my soul,</p><p>

    Touch the mountains, and they will smoke.</p><p>

    Throw out lightning, and scatter them.</p><p>
    Send out your arrows, and rout them.</p><p>
    <sup>7</sup>
    Stretch out your hand from above,</p><p>
    rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters,</p><p>
    out of the hands of foreigners,</p><p>
    <sup>8</sup>whose mouths speak deceit,</p><p>whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.</p><p>
    <sup>9</sup>
    I will sing a new song to you, God.</p><p>
    On a ten-stringed lyre, I will sing praises to you.</p><p>
    <sup>10</sup>
    You are he who gives salvation to kings,</p><p>
    who rescues David, his servant, from the deadly sword.</p><p>
    <sup>11</sup>
    Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hands of foreigners,</p><p>
    whose mouths speak deceit,</p><p>
    whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.</p><p>
